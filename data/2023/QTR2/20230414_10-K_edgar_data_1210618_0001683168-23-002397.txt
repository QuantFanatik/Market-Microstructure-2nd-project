SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 

Our business is subject to risks of which you
should be aware before making an investment decision. The risks described below are a summary of the principal risks associated with an
investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, the risk factors described in Item 1A , and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

Risks Related to Our Company 

We have incurred net losses, experienced net cash outflows from operating activities and recorded working
capital deficits. If we do not effectively manage our cash and other liquid financial assets and execute our liquidity plan, we may not
be able to satisfy repayment requirements on our borrowings. 
 
 We are in default on a number of our obligations, which could result in our being forced to cease operations
if we are unable to reach satisfactory settlement with applicable counterparties. 
 
 Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 
 
 Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
and we may not be able to remediate these weaknesses. Additionally, our management may identify material weaknesses in the future that
could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our securities and increase our cost of raising capital. 
 
 We rely substantially on our senior management team and our ability to attract, train and retain qualified
personnel for our current and future success. 
 
 We conduct our business in diverse locations around the world and are subject to economic, regulatory,
social and political risks internationally and in the regions where we operate. 

Risks Related to Our Solar Projects Business 

The reduction, modification, delay or discontinuation of government subsidies and other economic incentives
for the solar industry may reduce the profitability or viability of our solar projects and materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 The significant period of time between our upfront investments in solar projects and their commencement
of revenue generation could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, business and results of operations. 
 
 The market for solar project development is highly competitive. 
 
 We may not be able to obtain long-term contracts for the sale of electricity generated by our solar
projects under our IPP model at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments. 
 
 Our solar projects have short operating histories and may not perform up to our expectations. 

iv 

Risks Related to Our America Solar Module Manufacturing
Business 

We face risks associated with the international manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of
our products and the construction and operation of our US manufacturing facilities, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks,
our business and operations abroad may be adversely affected and our ability to maintain, develop and expand our business in the US may
be restricted. 
 
 Compliance with environmentally safe production and construction and renewable energy development regulations can be costly, while
non-compliance with such regulations might result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages, fines and suspension
of our business operations. 

Risks Related to Our PV Components Business 

We may have to secure payments for certain consumer solar or battery sales but there is no assurance
that such payments will be timely collected. We have also enhanced our collection efforts and undertaken various measures to collect outstanding
payments from customers and may suffer damages as a result of legal actions and other payments due to us. 
 
 Our sales may be subject to risks associated with construction, delays and other contingencies, which
could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and the results of operations. 
 
 Warranties provided by our third party installers and contractors may be limited or insufficient to
compensate for our losses, or may not cover the nature of our losses incurred. 
 
 We may be subject to product or strict liability claims if the provision of our services or the solar
projects we sell result in injury or damage, and we have limited insurance coverage to protect against such claims, as well as losses
that may result from business interruptions or natural disasters. 

Risks Related to Our Residential Roofing
and Solar Installation Business 

The solar energy industry is a new and evolving market, which may not grow to the size or at the rate we expect. 
 
 We might lose business to competitors that underbid us and might be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry. 
 
 Our business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather conditions, which can adversely impact our business. 
 
 The reduction, modification, delay or discontinuation of government subsidies and other economic incentives for the solar industry
might reduce the profitability or viability of our solar projects and materially adversely affect our business. 
 
 Existing rules, regulations and policies pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity
generation and changes to these regulations and policies might deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact
development of the solar energy industry. 

Risks Related to Our Operation in Phoenix 

Phoenix s results of operations have not resulted in profitability, and we may not be able
 to achieve profitability going forward. 

We have yet to achieve positive cash flow and, given our projected funding needs, our ability
 to generate positive cash flow is uncertain. 

Electric vehicles are a new industry, so Phoenix s success cannot be assured. 

Our plan to shift focus and primarily design, develop, manufacture and sell the EF-1 pickup truck
 and EF-1 V van, makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects. 

The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this
 industry. 

We have never manufactured vehicles on a higher volume commercial scale and our ability to design,
 develop and manufacture vehicles of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and on a large scale is unproven. 

v 

Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares 

Our ordinary shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB
is unable to inspect our auditors. The delisting of our ordinary shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely
affect the value of your investment. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading
on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of threes. 
 
 It may be difficult to effect service of process on, or to enforce any judgments obtained against us,
our directors, or our senior management members. 
 
 The price of our securities has been and may continue to be highly volatile. 
 
 If we fail to meet the applicable listing requirements, NASDAQ may delist our ordinary shares from
trading on its exchange in which case the liquidity and market price of our securities could decline and our ability to raise additional
capital would be adversely affected. 
 
 We are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. 

Risks Related to Our International Operations 

We are subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations of which may
negatively affect our revenue, cost of goods sold and gross margins and could result in exchange losses. 
 
 The ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone and market perceptions concerning the instability of the Euro
and the European economy could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financing. 

General Risk Factors 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. 
 
 Our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak. 
 
 Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats, attacks and other disruptions.

Corporate History and Organizational Structure 

History and Development of the Company 

Our legal and commercial name
is SPI Energy Co., Ltd. Our principal executive office is located at 4803 Urbani Ave McClellan Park, CA , 95652. Our telephone number
at this address is 888-575-1940. Our registered office is situated at 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church Street, PO Box 10240,
George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1002, Cayman Islands. 

The Company was incorporated
by SPI Power as a company limited by shares in the Cayman Islands on May 4, 2015. On January 4, 2016, we completed the redomiciliation
of SPI Power to the Cayman Islands, whereby SPI Power merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the holders of
SPI Power common stock received ADS representing ordinary shares of the Company. As a result, the former shareholders of SPI Power became
the beneficial owners of the capital stock of the Company, and the Company, together with our subsidiaries, now own and continue to conduct
SPI Power s business in substantially the same manner as was conducted by SPI Power and its subsidiaries. The Company is also managed
by substantially the same board of directors and executive officers that managed SPI Power previously. 

Between January 19, 2016
and September 18, 2017, our ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol of SPI . The Bank of New

in five states: California, Florida, Nevada, Colorado, and Texas. 

Since early 2020, PDI started
to face the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which placed inexorable pressure on the business. As a result of
the various shelter-in-place orders issued by local governments in response to the pandemic, PDI and its workforce were unable to operate
at full capacity, as jobs were closed down or work has been halted at sites throughout the United States. This disruption caused a significant
slowdown in collections, reductions in revenue, and cash-collection delays. As a result, PDI and 15 of its affiliates filed petitions
for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on June 11, 2020. 

In July 2022, the Group
made a decision that its SJ America subsidiary would pause its roofing and solar energy system installation business in the states of

Intended by us to be BT projects in 2022 and 2023 and may be held as our IPP projects upon completion of construction if we determine that the return of owning the projects and selling electricity is more attractive. 

As total capital expenditures
may be affected by various factors including, among others, increases in cost of key equipment and materials, failure to obtain sufficient
financing, unexpected engineering or environmental issues as well as changes in regulatory requirements, actual total capital expenditures
may deviate significantly from such estimates. We expect to finance construction of these projects using cash from our operations and
private placements, bank borrowings, financial leases as well as other third-party financing options. 

Solar Projects in Announced Pipeline 

As of April 14, 2023, we were
in the process of obtaining relevant regulatory approvals for the following self-developed and acquired solar projects:

Italy. As of April 14, 2023, we have 0.993 MW of solar projects in operation. In Italy, our project is eligible to receive FIT. 

Acquisition of Solar Projects 

Our board of directors has
formulated a uniform standard for assessing target assets with respect to the acquisition of solar projects, and such standard may be
adjusted based on our Company s business, financial condition and results of operations from time to time. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Operating Results-Recent Acquisition Activities on the
projects we have acquired or expect to acquire. Our board of directors considers the following criteria when assessing potential acquisitions,
among others: 

the internal rate of return of the project prior to leverage, taking into consideration applicable FIT or PPA rate, and other applicable government incentives; 

our ratio of debt-service coverage; 

the solar irradiation hours of the project, after discounting for performance; 

the use of financeable and reliable brands for and technical specifications of the key components, including modules, invertors, mounting systems, racks/tracking systems, and EPC integration services; 

any performance guarantees required, as well as any compensation for failing to perform; 

clear and trustworthy opinions from third-party professionals after detailed technical, financial, tax and legal due diligence; and 

reasonable payment terms matching relevant milestones. 

12 

Market Due Diligence 

We aim to select solar projects
located at sites with long solar irradiation hours, high energy demand, good supporting infrastructure, favorable tariff regimes, local
government support and appropriate topography for construction. We systematically analyze land cost, solar irradiation, grid connection
capacity, land and property status, government support, availability of project financing and any other project information that would
impact the overall economic return of the project. We target projects that we believe to have appropriate balance of financial returns,
costs and risks. 

Permit Development Process 

The permit development process
is the process of obtaining all required permits, certifications and approvals from relevant government authorities for solar project
development. As of December 31, 2022, most of our solar projects in operation had been undertaken by us as a secondary developer. 

We acquire solar projects
under development by third parties which have secured land use rights, development permits, or even begun construction. We typically learn
about potential projects suitable for secondary development from our business partners, national or local governments, industry publications,
overseas engineering exhibitions or overseas business liaison organizations. Our criteria for sourcing solar projects include land cost,
solar irradiation, availability of FIT benefits or other government incentives, grid connection capacity, local financing opportunities
and other project information. The selection process involves detailed due diligence into those third parties relevant company
documentation, financial projections and the legal status of permits already secured by the project. 

After an acquisition, we continue
to develop the project through grid connection as our own. We pursue secondary permit development in markets with relatively liquid markets
for energy permits transfer, thus allowing a smooth transfer of pre-operational solar assets from third-party developers to us. Under
certain circumstances, we negotiate site acquisition, preliminary permits, grid connection agreements and PPAs for projects under our
secondary development model depending on the development stage when we acquire them. 

Permit Development Steps 

The following sets forth each
step of our permit development: 

Evaluatin g project sites and location -The critical factors for evaluating the site of a solar project include its solar irradiation, its proximity to a grid connection point, zoning regulations and its general geographic and topographic features. If a project site is suitable for development or acquisition, our regional development team submits a site assessment report on the land and other related information to our management for evaluation and approval. 

Due diligence -Our in-house technical and EPC team, along with third-party experts we contract as needed, examine project items such as engineering and design specifications, technical risks and solar irradiation and environmental analyses. We pay special attentions to potential delays and cost overruns, grid capacity and additional costs which may not be captured in the technical design. We also ensure that a project has clean legal titles to the permits and other permissions it has secured. In all cases, we ensure that local regulations allow us to properly carry out our business intentions for a project, whether by allowing us to hold the project under our IPP model or transfer it under our BT model. 

Market considerations -We target projects which have appropriate balance of financial returns, costs and risks. Important factors include, the costs of maintenance, local taxes and fees, and the availability of applicable FIT, local credit or other refinancing options. Our financial teams conduct financial forecasts based on information about the financial prospects of the solar project and the local energy market to make a profitability estimate and adjust our capital plan accordingly. 

Permittin g -Permit and licensing requirements vary depending on the jurisdiction of the solar project, but the key permits, licenses and agreements typically required for solar projects include land acquisition or lease contracts, environmental impact assessments, building or rezoning permits, planning consents, grid connection contracts and PPAs. We work closely with relevant government and private stakeholders to secure all necessary permits to develop a project, including local or regional planning authorities, electric utilities, local communities, environmental agencies, as well as health and safety agencies. 

13 

Project Financing 

A solar project sponsor typically
sets up a project company as a special purpose vehicle to own a particular solar project and arrange for project financing. We typically
enter into contracts and other agreements under the name of the project company, which facilitates project financing by isolating the
project and its assets, and any potential securitization requirements, from our broader global business. 

The construction cost of a
project is mainly funded by our working capital, and to a lesser extent, funded through bank borrowings in the year ended December 31,
2022. We seek to negotiate favorable credit terms with our equipment suppliers and EPC contractors when possible, such that payment is
not due until several months after construction and grid connection are complete. Our working capital dedicated towards a particular project
would be generally available to us for other purposes if needed, and would not be considered restricted cash isolated at that project.
We also have given guarantees to the lenders on certain project financings. However, none of our cash and cash equivalents have been collateralized
to guarantee such project financings. 

We generally seek to arrange
debt financing for our solar projects from local banks and financial leasing companies in countries that are more open and receptive to
renewable energy investments. 

Engineering, Procurement and Construction 

Given the multi-jurisdiction
coverage of our project portfolio, we choose to utilize our EPC capabilities or contract third party EPC contractors to service our own
projects, based on our cost analysis taking into consideration of locations, topographical conditions as well as the quality and competition
of local EPC service providers. 

Our Operation and Maintenance Business 

We operate and maintain solar
projects connected to the grid, especially those we have provided EPC services to. We may choose to contract third party O M contractors
to service our own projects, based on our cost analysis taking into consideration of locations, topographical conditions as well as the
quality and competition of local EPC service providers. We regularly maintain solar projects for our customers to ensure that these projects
operate in good condition and comply with the recommendations issued by the grid company in order to remain connected. 

By operating the projects
effectively and efficiently, we reduce down time and increase electricity output. A project s major lifecycle costs mainly consist
of maintenance fee and depreciation of modules, inverters and transformers. We monitor electricity production and any incidents or abnormalities
which may impede normal operation. We adjust production levels based on the available capacity of the grid.

Our Electric Vehicle (EV) Business 

On November 12, 2020, we completed
the acquisition of Phoenix Cars LLC and Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC (together, Phoenix ). 

Phoenix, doing business as
 Phoenix Motorcars through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC, Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC, and EdisonFuture
Motor, Inc., currently designs, assembles, and integrates electric drive systems and light and medium duty electric vehicles EVs and markets and sells electric vehicle chargers for the commercial and residential markets. Phoenix operates two primary brands, Phoenix
Motorcars focused on commercial products including medium duty vehicles, chargers and electric forklifts, and EdisonFuture 
which intends to offer light-duty vehicles. Over the years, we have served over 42 fleet customers with a variety of needs, providing
customized products to complete essential business functions. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 116 EVs, representing
what we believe is the largest number of Class 4 cutaway medium duty electric shuttle bus deployments in the U.S. and the most electric
vehicles deployed on the Ford E-Series chassis. With over four million zero-emission miles accumulatively driven by the vehicles we delivered,
we have gained significant industry experience, distinct expertise and extensive knowledge in R D, production, commercialization,
customer engagement and validation of light and medium duty EVs, enabling us to drive continued design enhancements and innovations in
our current and future generations drivetrain systems and other products. As of December 31, 2022, our backlog of approximately 61 orders
consists of 56 vehicles and 5 electric drive system kits. The order backlog represents 12.22 million of revenue, consisting of 11.88
million for vehicles and 0.34 million for electric drive systems. 

Our EV buses and trucks are
available in a range of configurations, including shuttle buses, Type A school buses, utility trucks, service trucks, flatbed trucks,
walk-in vans, and cargo trucks. Our delivery customers include major airports, airport shuttle operators, hotel chains, seaports, universities,
municipalities, and large corporations. 

We believe that our EVs offer
owners and fleet operators significant benefits, including: 

Lower Ownership Cost . Electric vehicles cost less in total to own, operate, and maintain than diesel, gasoline and natural gas combustion-powered vehicles, even though the initial purchase price (after subsidies) is somewhat higher. 

Less Maintenance, Lower Operating Cost, Greater Safety . Because electric motors have few moving parts and do not need liquid fuels or lubricants, they generally require less maintenance, are less expensive to operate, and avoid exposure to or spills or need to dispose of hazardous hydrocarbon fluids. 

Zero Vehicle Emissions. EVs enable customers to satisfy government mandates limiting vehicular emissions. 

Positive User Recognition. Our customers use of EVs may improve their public images, thereby conferring a competitive advantage. 

Improved Driver and Passenger Comfort . Electric vehicles run more quietly than combustion-powered vehicles, enhancing operator and passenger comfort. 

15 

We assist customers with all
aspects of fleet electrification, including recommending battery power levels needed for the customer s applications; advising regarding
necessary infrastructure, such as types of external chargers required and their locations, and whether the customer s facilities
have sufficient power for charging; and assistance with the customer s contractors that install infrastructure. 

We sell our vehicles to fleet
customers directly; retail sales of vehicles carrying Forest River, Inc. bodies, e.g. , Starcraft bus bodies and Rockford truck
bodies) are made through Creative Bus Sales, one of the largest distributors of buses in the United States. 

On June 7, 2022, Phoenix priced
its initial public offering (the IPO of 2,100,000 shares of its common stock, par value 0.0004 per share, at 7.50 per
share. The shares are listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market and trade under the ticker symbol PEV beginning on June 8, 2022.
As of the date of this report, we indirectly owned approximately 82.6 of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding common stock
of Phoenix through EdisonFuture, Inc., which is 100 owned by SPI Energy Co., Ltd. 

Our Business of Residential Roofing and
Solar Installations 

On January 6, 2021, SJ US
purchased of all work-in-progress consumer contracts of Petersen-Dean, Inc. PDI for a consideration of 0.88 million in
a court-approved agreement. On February 25, 2021, SJ US closed the acquisition of substantially all operating assets of Petersen-Dean
including certain construction contracts with work-in-progress billings, fixed assets, intellectual properties and other assets, for a
total cash consideration of 6.85 million, plus the assumption of 11 million of outstanding balance under an account receivables financing,
net off by accounts receivables pledged for the liability with net balance of PDI of 11.7 million. PDI specializes in residential roofing
and solar installations across the U.S., and after acquisition, SJ US operated the business with its own brand and earned revenue of 25.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Our Made-in-America 
Solar Modules Manufacturing Business 

SJ Technology, our Sacramento,
California-based solar module manufacturing subsidiary, opened our first US solar module assembly factory in January 2022 in McClellan
Park, California, which commenced pilot production in the second quarter of 2022 and began
delivering Solar4America brand modules to customers weekly during the third quarter of 2022. We achieved installed capacity of 650MW per
year by the end of 2022, assuming the installed production line is running at full shift. SJ Technology intends to sell most
of our American-made solar modules under our own Solar4America brand, to distributors, project developers and system integrators,
and a small portion of solar modules on an OEM basis. We subleased existing solar module manufacturing facilities with a total floor area
of 139,100 square feet located in McClellan Park, acquired certain pieces of solar module assembly equipment from Sunergy California LLC,
and additional solar module assembly equipment from YingKou JinChen Machinery Co Ltd and Wuxi Autowell Supply Chain Management Co Ltd.
to expand our capacity at the McClellan Park facility. In August 2022, we subleased additional space with a total floor area of 56,000
square feet, adjacent to SJ Technology s current solar module manufacturing facility at McClellan Park. The expansion will enable
us to meet the strong demand for its American-made solar modules. We expect that the production capacity of SJ Technology will be further
increased to 2.4 GW per year by the end of 2023 as the result acquiring and putting into operation additional solar module assembly equipment
and coupled with the utilization of the additional 56,000 square foot facility in McClellan Park, California and well as opening a new
facility on the East Coast of the United States.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 - New and Expanded
Production and Tax Credits for Manufacturers and Projects to Support Clean Energy 

On August 16, 2022,
President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ). The IRA contains provisions which we expect
will have a significant impact on the development and financing of clean energy projects in the United States over the next ten years.
The IRA includes a number of key changes relevant to clean energy in the United States, among them the extension of the Investment Tax
Credit and Production Tax Credit and the addition of expanded tax credits for other technologies and for manufacturing of clean energy
equipment as well as terms allowing parties to more easily monetize the tax credits. The IRA also includes some targeted incentives intended
to encourage development in low-income communities and the use of domestically produced materials and compliance with certain prevailing
wage requirements. The IRA contains a two-tiered credit-amount structure for many applicable tax credits. Specifically, many of the credits
have a lower base credit amount that can be increased up to five times if the taxpayer can satisfy applicable prevailing wage or apprenticeship
requirements. In general, under the prevailing wage requirements, the IRA requires all laborers, mechanics and workers to be paid the
prevailing wage during project construction (and, during the credit term, for repairs and alterations). Separately and subject to certain
exceptions, to meet the apprenticeship requirements, qualified apprentices have to perform an applicable percentage of total labor hours
for project construction. Further, the IRA establishes certain options to cure the failure to meet either the prevailing wage or apprenticeship
requirements. 

We believe that two areas
of the IRA will have direct significant benefits for us. First, the impact of the new Section 45X of the IRA will be significant to us,
especially our SJ Technology business. Under Section 45X, production credits will be available for each eligible solar component that
is produced domestically and sold to an unrelated party. Section 45X credits are based on the type of equipment or material manufactured,
how much equipment or material is produced, and certain other criteria. We anticipate that Section 45X will spur United States solar manufacturing
to a degree that may not yet be fully appreciated. According to Section 45X of the IRA, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPTC)
is available for the production of eligible components which includes solar modules, solar wafers, solar cells produced in the United
States and sold after December 31, 2022. The amount of the AMPTC for solar modules are mandated to be 0.07 per module capacity in Wdc.
SJ Technology produces Made-in-America solar modules under its Solar4America brand. The Section 45X production credit encourages
innovation and efficiency because, for example, with respect to certain solar components, credits are tied to the productivity of a solar
panel rather than its cost, encouraging companies to manufacture higher-efficiency panels rather than raise prices to increase credits. 

Secondly, the Residential
Clean Energy Credit under the IRA allows residential customers to subtract 30 percent of solar costs off their federal taxes as a tax
credit through 2032. If residential customers install solar energy equipment in their residence
any time from 2022 through the end of 2032, they are entitled to a nonrefundable tax credit off their federal income taxes, equal to 30
percent of eligible expenses. There s no dollar limit on those expenses. We believe this increase to a 30 tax credit under the
IRA will significantly enhance SJ America s U.S. residential roofing and solar installation business. According to
the Department of Energy, the new IRA s language covers the same expenses to be eligible for this new solar tax credit, as those
that were declining under the expiring old law, including: 

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. 

PV cells used to power an attic fan (but not the fan itself). 

Contractor labor for onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation. 

Permitting fees, inspection costs, and developer fees. 

All equipment needed to get the solar system running, including wiring, inverters, and mounting equipment. 

Storage batteries. (You can claim the tax credit for these even if you buy and install them a year or more after you install the solar system.) 

Sales taxes on eligible expenses. 

17 

We believe having our own
branded products provides greater opportunities to differentiate us in a competitive market. especially when certain products are in short
supply in the market, such as current market conditions for made-in-America solar modules, which we expect will accelerate our brand and
product penetration into the U.S. domestic market. 

Our
solar modules utilize advanced solar technologies, such as the Passive Emitter and Rear Contact or PERC technology and full
cell technology. We expect that our high-quality manufacturing capabilities will enable us to produce solar modules meeting the industry s
highest performance standards, and all of our American-made solar modules sold
in North America are UL certified. 

Competition 

Solar Power Market 

The solar power market is
intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, and we compete with major international and domestic companies over the development of solar
projects. Our major competitors include leading global players such as SunPower Corporation, First Solar, Inc., Canadian Solar, Inc.,
SunEdison, Inc., SolarCity Corporation, Lightsource Renewable Energy Limited, and regional players such as West Holdings Corporation,
Looop Inc., and other regional and international developers. 

We believe that we can compete
favorably with our competitors given that the key competitive factors for solar project development and operation include, without limitation: 

industry reputation and development track record; 

site selection and acquisition; 

permit and project development experience and expertise; 

relationship with government authorities and knowledge of local policies; 

ability to secure high-quality PV modules and balance-of-system components at favorable prices and terms; 

ready access to project financing; 

control over the quality, efficiency and reliability of project development; 

expertise in permit and project development; and 

expertise in providing EPC and O M services. 

18 

However, we cannot guarantee
that some of our competitors do not or will not have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management
or other resources in particular markets or in general. In terms of the broader energy sector, the entire solar industry faces competition
from other power generation sources, including conventional sources as well as other emerging technologies. Solar power has certain advantages
and disadvantages when compared to other power generating technologies. The advantages include the ability to deploy products in many
sizes and configurations, install products almost anywhere in the world, provide reliable power for many applications and reduce air,
water and noise pollution. Yet other energy sources have advantages which may result in electric utilities, grid companies or other off-takers
to enter PPAs or other electricity purchase arrangements with companies specializing in those energy sources rather than us or other companies
specializing in solar power. 

Electric Vehicle (EV) Business 

Competition in the light
and medium-duty truck industry is intense, as new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances, and shifting
customer demands are pushing the industry towards zero-emission solutions. 

Phoenix competes with a number
of commercial EV manufacturers, including those such as Lightning eMotors, GreenPower Bus, SEA Electric and Arrival. Several major companies,
including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. In addition, many of the aforementioned
companies, along with others, such as Volvo, BYD, Hyundai, Honda, and Fiat participate in the hybrid combined electric and gasoline powered
vehicle business, which includes commercial vehicles that may compete with Phoenix. Most of our current and potential competitors have
greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than we do. They may be able to deploy greater resources to
the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their electric truck programs. Additionally,
those competitors have greater name recognition, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships, and other resources
than we do. 

Our Business of Residential Roofing and
Solar Installations business and Australia Distribution Business 

As PV and energy storage technology
advances and the average system costs decrease, in many cases the residential or small business owners of solar systems have effectively
achieved grid parity for their systems. Aided by smart meter and virtual power plant technologies such systems can be an attractive alternative
to electricity grid in many localities. We expect traditionally strong residential solar markets such as California and Australia to continue
to grow. As the overall market grows we expect our costs of sales to decrease and our revenue and profitability to increase. 

Suppliers 

There are numerous suppliers
of PV modules in the solar power industry, and we have adopted a supplier-neutral approach. For our global project development business,
we select the suppliers based on whether we could obtain high-quality PV modules and balance-of-system components at favorable prices
and payment terms. For global project development business, we procure our PV modules from a broad range of suppliers including Trina
Solar Limited, LONGi Solar, Zhongli Talesun Solar Co., Ltd, Hanwha Q Cells GmbH, and Chint, among others. we are planning to procure PV
modules from our own brand Solar4America to further increase the profitability. 

In March 2021, we began delivering
our third generation EVs, featuring our new, Romeo Power, Inc. modular battery packs, giving customers choices among 31KwH, 63KwH, 94KwH,
125KwH, and 156KwH batteries. Our ZEUS 300 EVs are built on the Ford F-450 chassis, with Romeo Power battery and Dana TM4 SumoTM MD motors,
and BTC Power battery chargers. While the relationships with our key suppliers remain strong, we conduct evaluation of all suppliers on
regular basis based on their quality, reliability, cost effectiveness, warranty standards, shipping standards and set up mitigation plan
accordingly. 

19 

SJ Australia purchases its
products from the best in class PV manufacturers that offer products with strong market demand that, generally, allow us to sell the products
at higher gross margins. Our leading brands in each product category include, for inverters, Sungrow, Fronius and SMA; for solar panels,
Trina and LONGi, for battery storage systems, Tesla and Sungrow; and for BOS and mounting, Tigo, Clenergy,Wallbox and Mibet. SJ Australia
actively reviews its product portfolio to discontinue products with low volume, low margin, or poor performance records. SJ Australia
enters into agreements with its suppliers during the ordinary course of business. 

SJ America purchases materials
from leading distributors in the construction and PV industries. We also purchase key solar components, such as panels and batteries from
suppliers in Asia and in the US. 

SJ Technology has begun to
offer its Solar4America private-label as its standard product, with third party products offered as premium choices for consumers. SJ
Technology has entered into purchase and other agreements with various suppliers including Jincheng, Sunergy and Autowell to purchase
additional manufacturing equipment and expand of its production capacities. 

The Company enters into agreements
with its suppliers during the ordinary course of business. 

Customers and Marketing 

We have historically
provided EPC and O M services, a line of business we are still engaged in when we develop and operate the solar projects. We are
also selling electricity to the grid under our IPP model as well as selling solar projects under our BT model. For our global
project development business, purchasers of our BT projects included utility companies, independent power developers and producers,
commercial and industrial companies as well as investors in the solar business. For our Orange Power business, we sell electricity
to power companies and other electricity off-takers, including government-owned utility companies, operating in the United States,
Greece and Italy under our IPP model. Further, customers of our Australia distribution business include residential ones, towards
which we distribute PV modules, balance of system components, solar monitoring systems and inverters. 

During the year ended December
31, 2022, there was no sale of PV solar systems. 

We promote our reputation
by participating in industry conferences worldwide and aggressively sourcing development opportunities in markets with strong growth potential.
Members of our senior and local management team routinely meet with industry players and interested investors. Our business development
teams around the world have significant experience building business in local markets and actively pursue growth opportunities around
the world. We intend to continue to increase our marketing efforts going forward. 

We historically engaged in
high-profile marketing activities focused on developing our brand awareness not just among the solar business developers who have traditionally
been our customers, but also among the general public. Since we have been in solar business for 15 years, we have built our brand awareness
and lately we have not engaged in marketing activities. 

As one of the early movers
in the medium-duty electrification market, Phoenix Motorcars has built a reputation as one of the leading manufacturers in the segment.
Our range of vehicles includes all-electric shuttle buses, flatbed trucks, utility trucks, box trucks, service van and custom bodies on
a class-4 electric chassis and is used by customers across a wide range of applications including cities, transit agencies, airports,
utility agencies, contractors, campuses and other commercial fleets. Phoenix Motorcars has particularly good awareness among shuttle bus
customers and has the highest number of class-4 shuttle buses deployed. Further Phoenix also partnerships with industry leaders like Forest
River, the largest shuttle bus manufacturer in the country and Creative Bus Sales, the largest bus dealership network to jointly sell
and service the shuttle bus product. Being a sunrise industry, most of Phoenix s fleet customers are first time EV users and Phoenix
provides end-to-end electrification solutions to support their efforts. This includes not just providing vehicles, but also supporting
with route planning, charging infrastructure planning, charging equipment and telematics solutions for in-service vehicles.

Seasonality 

Demand for solar power products
tends to be weaker during the winter months partly due to adverse weather conditions in certain regions, which complicate the installation
of solar power systems. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period based on the seasonality of industry demand for solar
power products. Certain aspects of our operations are also subject to seasonal variations. For example, we may schedule significant construction
activities to connect solar projects to the grids prior to a scheduled decrease in FIT rates in order to qualify for more favorable FIT
policies. 

The electric Vehicles business
is not seasonal, but application and decision timelines of key incentive programs like the California HVIP program and the annual Federal
Transit Administration s LowNo program impact the timing of purchase orders for applicable customer segments. 

Insurance 

We maintain the types and
amounts of insurance coverage that we believe are consistent with customary industry practices in all the countries where we operate.
Our insurance policies cover employee-related accidents and injuries, property damage, machinery breakdowns, fixed assets, facilities
and liability deriving from our activities, including environmental liability. We maintain business interruption insurance for interruptions
resulting from incidents covered by insurance policies. We have not had any material claims under our insurance policies that would either
invalidate our insurance policies or cause a material increase to our insurance premiums. We cannot assure you, however, that our insurance
coverage will adequately protect us from all risks that may arise or in amounts sufficient to prevent any material loss. 

Regulations 

We operate in multiple jurisdictions,
including the U.S., Japan, the U.K, Greece, Italy and Australia. We are therefore subject to complex laws, regulations and policies promulgated
by the governments and government-run utilities of these jurisdictions, including FIT regulations, clean energy incentive rules and programs,
laws and regulations that apply to all power producers, regulations that specifically apply to solar power project operators, EPC service
providers as well as solar kit distributors, tax regulations and intellectual property laws, among others. Likewise, our hemp and CBD
businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and guidelines by governmental authorities relating to, among other things, the manufacture,
marketing, management, transportation, storage, sale, pricing and disposal of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabis-based products, and also
including laws, regulations and guidelines relating to health and safety, insurance coverage, the conduct of operations and the protection
of the environment. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are
involved in various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While we cannot predict the occurrence
or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, we do not believe that an adverse result in any pending legal or regulatory proceeding
to which we are a party, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows
or results of operations other than the following:

SINSIN Disputes 

There is dispute between the
Company and SPI China (HK) Limited on one hand (hereinafter collectively, SPI and SINSIN Europe Solar Asset Limited Partnership
and SINSIN Solar Capital Limited Partnership on the other hand (hereinafter collectively, SINSIN with respect to a share
sale and purchase agreement dated September 9, 2014 SPA entered into by and between SINSIN, as vendors, and SPI, as purchasers,
in relation to all of the shares in Sinsin Renewable Investment Limited, a company registered in Malta (for purpose of this section, SRIL ).
The SPA is governed by Maltese law and any disputes thereunder shall be referred to arbitration in Malta. SRIL is the direct and/or indirect
owner of four (4) Greek companies under the names JASPER PV MACEDONIA ENERGIAKI SOCIETE ANONYME , ORION ENERGIAKI
SOCIETE ANONYME PHOTOVOLTAICON ERGON , ASTRAIOS ENERGIAKI SOCIETE ANONYME PHOTOVOLTAICON ERGON , PHOTOVOLTAICA
PARKA VEROIA I SOCIETE ANONYME (hereinafter collectively, 4 SPVs ). The 4 SPVs collectively own a number of photovoltaic
parks in Greece having a total power output of 26.57 MW. 

Proceedings were initiated
both in Greece and Malta in relation to this dispute. 

Proceedings in Greece 

In particular, the following
judicial proceedings were initiated in Greece and are pending as of the date of this annual report: 

A. SINSIN s Injunction
Petition against the 4 SPVs dated January 26, 2018, with General Submission No 8118/2018, which was heard on the March 20, 2018, before
the Athens One-Member First Instance Court and on which Judgement No 4212/2018 was issued on June 25, 2018. 

This Interim Measures Judgment
ordered, inter alia, the following: 

(A) It suspends the force
of the extraordinary General Meetings of the shareholders of the 4 SPVs dated December 19, 2017 on the appointment of their members of
Board of Directors, until the issuance of a final judgment on the lawsuit filed by SINSIN on March 14, 2018 for the annulment of the extraordinary
General Meetings of the shareholders of the 4 SPVs dated December 19, 2017. 

(B) It appoints an interim
management of the 4 SPVs, consisting of two members elected by SINSIN (Dejun Ye and Fan Yang) and one member elected by the 4 SPVs (Hoong
Khoeng Cheong), with the following, exclusively defined, competences: (a) to represent judicially and extra-judicially the 4 SPVs before
any public authority and court, (b) to manage the bank accounts of the 4 SPVs, in order to, exclusively and solely, proceed with the payment
of existing and current obligations of the 4 SPVs towards third parties, arising from their regular management (liabilities towards the
State, employees, social security institutions, private creditors, banks), excluding the payment of any price of the shares that were
transferred from SINSIN to SPI pursuant to the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014, (c) to collect
the proceeds of the 4 SPVs, especially from selling electric energy from the photovoltaic parks of the 4 SPVs to the Operator of Electricity
Market LAGIE ), which (proceeds) should be subsequently deposited to the bank accounts of the 4 SPVs, with the exclusive
purpose being the payment of the above under element b obligations of the 4 SPVs (i.e., not for the payment of the purchase price
of the shares transferred by SINSIN to SPI pursuant to the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014.) 

(C) It allows the petitioners
to register with the Greek General Commercial Registry GEMI the appointed interim management of the 4 SPVs with the above
competences. 

B. SINSIN s and Mr.
Dejun Ye s lawsuit against the 4 SPVs dated March 14, 2018, with General Submission No. 25276/2018 (the Annulment Lawsuit ).
By virtue of the Annulment Lawsuit, the petitioners request the annulment of the December 19, 2017 General Assemblies Resolutions
of the 4 SPVs, which appointed a Board of Directors elected by their shareholders SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia
1 Malta Limited, companies belonging to SPI. 

22 

SPI and their subsidiaries
opposed the above-mentioned petition. SPI and their subsidiaries SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited
filed an Additional Intervention in the above pending trial under General No. 40772/2018 in favor of the 4 SPVs requesting the rejection
of the Annulment Lawsuit. 

By virtue of its Decision
No 2318/2019, the Athens Multimember Court of First Instance suspended the issuance of a definitive judgment on SINSIN s petition
until the issuance of a final decision on the case pending before the Malta arbitration tribunal with respect to the SPA. 

C. By virtue of a petition
under General Submission No 7294/2018 dated January 25, 2018 filed by SINSIN before the Athens Local Court against SRIL, Veltimo Limited
and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited, SINSIN lacking an enforcement title, requested the above Athens Local Court to allow them
to proceed to an auction of the pledged shares of the 4 SPVs, in order to satisfy their claim amounting to EUR 38.3 million, plus interest
and expenses, for the outstanding purchase price of the 4 SPVs shares under the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated
September 6, 2014. 

SRIL, Veltimo Limited and
Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited opposed the above-mentioned petition. 

The above petition was heard
on October 23, 2018. The Athens Local Court issued Decision No. 350/2019, which suspended the issuance of a definitive judgment on SINSIN s
petition until the issuance of a final decision on the case pending before the Malta arbitration tribunal with respect to the SPA. 

Proceedings in Malta 

In June 2018, the Company,
as Claimant, filed arbitration proceedings in Malta against SINSIN as respondents for an alleged breach of a share sale and purchase agreement
dated September 6, 2014 entered into by and between the respondents as sellers and the claimant as purchaser in relation to all of the
shares in SRIL. The claimant is requesting the payment of damages from the respondents. 

The respondents have filed
separate arbitration proceedings in Malta against the Company, requesting payment of the balance of the purchase price due in terms of
the share purchase agreement mentioned above (stated to be EUR38,054,000) together with interest. The Company contested these claims.
Meanwhile, SINSIN obtained a precautionary garnishee order against the Company as security for its claims and had the same order served
on SRIL with a view to freezing any payments that may be due by SRIL to SPI. In February, 2019, SINSIN also obtained the issue of a precautionary
warrant of prohibitory injunction prohibiting SPI from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in SRIL. 

On October 29, 2020, awards
were issued in both cases, pursuant to which the tribunal dismissed all of SPI s claims and admitted SINSIN s counterclaim
for payment of the balance of the price of 38,054,000, with interest at 6 accruing from November 30, 2015, on half of this amount,
and from June 20, 2016, on the other half. SINSIN s claims for additional damages were rejected (the First Award ).
Costs of the case filed by SPI case 5320/18) are to be borne by SPI, while the costs for case 5532/18 are to be borne 80 by SPI the
 Second Award , First Award and Second Awards collectively as Awards ). On November 13, 2020, SPI filed Appeal
Applications to appeal the awards with the Court of Appeal (Inferior Jurisdiction). The Appeal were eventually heard on 23 April 2021.
By virtue of two judgements delivered contemporaneously on 12 November 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed both Appeals filed by SPI on
the procedural ground of non-appealability of the Awards. Following consideration of the appeal judgements, the application for retrial
was filed on the ground of wrong application of the law. The applications for retrial were filed on 29 November 2021 together with applications
for the suspension of the execution of the Awards pending the determination of the retrial applications. The latter applications were
accepted by the court pending the consideration of the applications for retrial. Following a hearing held on 16 March 2022 during which
the parties were given the opportunity to make final submissions with regard to the application for retrial, on 30 March 2022 the Court
of Appeal delivered its final judgement by virtue of which the applications for retrial of the Appeal were rejected. In consequence, the
order for the suspension of the enforcement of the Awards was also lifted. While no further appeal or right of retrial exists in Malta,
SPI is yet to obtain advice as to whether any other options are available to it to suspend the enforcement of the Awards. Meanwhile, SPI
is also taking advice with regard to the time that will be required for SINSIN to complete the procedures necessary for the enforcement
of the Awards in Malta and in Greece, and preliminary indications are that relevant procedures are unlikely to be completed during the
course of 2023. Confirmatory advice in this regard is pending, however. 

23 

Proceedings in US 

On November 3, 2022, SinSin
have filed a petition for recognition of the Awards in the US (the Action ), with a view to obtaining the option to enforce
the awards in US if and when required. Through the Action, SinSin petitions under the New York Convention to confirm the Awards issued
on October 20, 2020, in Malta arising out of the contract dispute relating to SPA and seeks a judgment from the United States District
Court confirming the Awards. The Action was initiated by SinSin on November 3, 2022. The Company filed a Response on January 2, 2023,
contesting the Petition. As of the Date of this report, no hearing date has been set on the Petition, and the Court has not otherwise
ruled on it. Given the early stage of the Action, and pending reply by SinSin to the Company s Response, or further action by the
Court, we believe the probable outcome of this matter is uncertain but the Company is actively engaging the settlement discussion with
Sinsin and a resolution will be expected within 2023. 

Shengrun Dispute 

Solar Juice USA Inc. SolarJuice ),
a subsidiary of the Company, submitted a complaint in the local court in the county of Santa Clara in the State of California on or about
June 11, 2020 against Shengrun Int l Industry Group, Inc., a California corporation Shengrun and Sophie Harrison,
a resident of the State of California and the purported controlling person of Shengrun. In March 2019, SolarJuice and Shengrun entered
into a real property purchase agreement pursuant to which SolarJuice shall purchase from Shengrun a real property located in Santa Clara
in the State of California. Subsequently, SolarJuice made a down payment of 3,132,000 to Shengrun for the proposed transaction, and Sophie
Harrison provided personal guarantee that if Shengrun does not convey the property to SolarJuice or if SolarJuice withdraws from the transaction,
she would be personally liable for the return of the down payment to SolarJuice. As of the date hereof, the subject property has not been
conveyed to SolarJuice, neither has Shengrun or Ms. Harrison refunded the down payment to SolarJuice. Counsel for SolarJuice on this matter
reasonably expects that the court shall render a verdict against Shengrun and Ms. Harrison personally (as related to the personal guarantee)
and in favor of SolarJuice. However, the counsel does not have the information to assess whether Shengrun or Ms. Harrison has the assets
available for the governmental authorities or the Company to enforce such verdict. 

AHP Dispute 

The Company and its various
subsidiaries are listed as defendants on a claim for fraudulent transfer pending before superior court of the state of Arizona. This dispute
involves the transfer of 15 of ownership of Arizona Hay Press, LLC. AHP claimed to be originally owned by Woods 
Sons, Inc.as Plaintiff, Presently, AHP primary asset is a 120 acre parcel of land. In May 2019, The Company and its various subsidiaries
entered into various agreements pursuant to which the Company acquired all shares of AHP. The legal process is ongoing with resolution
expected during the calendar year 2023. 

Sulus Dispute 

The Company is respondent
on a claim pending in arbitration before ADR Services, Inc. SPI Solar, Inc., agreed to purchase from Sulus LLC certain solar photovoltaic
Projects under a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement MIPA dated July 15, 2019. The MIPA contained a project-by-project
purchase price escalation clause conditioned upon each Project meeting certain requirements and being awarded into Oregon s Community
Solar Program. Sulus LLC alleges that four Projects, Belvedere Solar LLC, Manchester Solar LLC, Dover Solar LLC and Clayfield Solar LLC,
have met the MIPA conditions for the price escalation, and that two Projects, Cork Solar LC and Waterford Solar LLC, still may meet the
price escalation conditions. For the four Projects alleged to meet the conditions, Sulus LLC alleges additional compensation is due, and
for the two Projects that Sulus LLC alleges may meet the conditions, Sulus LLC estimates additional compensation is due as well. SPI Solar,
Inc., denies the allegations, that the MIPA conditions have not been met, and specifically that any of the Projects have yet been awarded
into Oregon s Community Solar Program. It is also SPI Solar, Inc. s position that the time for the Projects to meet the conditions
for the price escalation in the MIPA has passed. On December 13, 2021, an order from the arbitrator was issued and awarded the full amount
to Sulus LLC. The cross petitions to enter judgment on the award and to vacate it were timely filed by Sulus LLC and the Company, respectively.
On September 8, 2022, Multnomah County Court issued a judgment in favor of Sulus in the principal amount of US 1,400,000. On January 20,
2023, the parties to the litigation entered into a confidential settlement agreement.

Streeterville 2022 Note Dispute 

On February 16, 2023, One
of the Company s convertible bondholder, Streeterville Capital, LLC Streeterville delivered a Redemption Notice
to the Company to redeem 350,000 of a promissory note entered into on April 8, 2022 with a deadline to pay the Redemption Amount by February
22, 2023. The Company failed to pay the Redemption Amount on time and such failure to pay is an Event of Default under the 2022 Note.
Due to this Event of Default, (i) the base interest of the 2022 Note was increased to 15 per annum; (ii) the outstanding balance of the
2022 Note was increased by 15 ; and (iii) the entire outstanding balance of the 2022 Note was accelerated and due on March 3, 2023. The
Group failed to pay the outstanding balance of the 2022 Note by March 3, 2023 and as a result, Streeterville filed a complaint in the
third judicial district court of Salt Lake County, requesting for actual damages in an amount not less than 2.7 million, plus applicable
interest, damages, charges, fees, attorney fees, and collection costs. On March 31, 2023, a hearing was held and the temporary restraining
order requiring the Company to pay the 2022 Note in full from the proceeds of the IPO of its subsidiary, SolarJuice Co., Ltd. The Company
has engaged attorneys to act as legal representatives for this case while actively negotiating the settlement discussion with Streeterville
and a resolution is expected to be within 2023. 

NAAC Dispute 

The Company is currently involved
in a potential lawsuit against Native American Agricultural Company NAAC regarding our newly set up CBD and hemp business.
The Company was required to make a down payment of 324,125 to NAAC on or before July 31, 2019, and the Company timely made this payment.
Subsequently, however, NAAC failed to comply with or perform the Agreement dated as of July 24 2019 entered into by and between CBD and
Hemp Group Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Hemp Biotechnology, Inc. and NAAC. First, in August 2019, representatives
of the Company visited the farm where NAAC was growing the hemp. The conditions of the plants and growing operations appeared to be deficient
and not up to industry standards. Second, NAAC failed to provide the required Milestone Report and Financial Reports. Finally, NAAC failed
to deliver any of the hemp plants by November 30, 2019, or at all, and refused and failed to return Company s down payment and to
make whole for the damages the Company has suffered. As such, the Company believes NAAC was in default under the Agreement. The Company
sent two demand letters to NAAC on October 25, 2019 and November 25, 2019 respectively without any response from NAAC. Mr. Da Mu Lin and
Mr. Yonglei Zhang provided personal guarantee to guaranty the full performance and contractual obligations of NAAC. In March 2022, the
Company has filed the complaint against Mr. Da Mu Lin and Mr. Yonglei Zhang for fraud in the inducement, unfair or deceptive trade practices,
breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. 

However, an unfavorable outcome
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a specific interim period or year. 

Taxation 

The following summary of the
material Cayman Islands and United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares is based upon laws and
relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this annual report, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. This summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax
consequences under United States state or local tax laws, or tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands and the United States. 

Cayman Islands Taxation 

The Cayman Islands currently
does not levy taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation, and there is no taxation in the
Cayman Islands in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government
of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duty which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the
jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not a party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made
to or by our Company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. 

25 

Economic Substance Law 

Since January 1, 2019, the
Cayman Islands adopted certain laws and regulations in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)Forum
on Harmful Tax Practices, which sets the global standard that requires companies to have substantial activities in a jurisdiction (also
known as economic substance ).To date, the Cayman Islands have passed or adopted the International Tax Co-Operation (Economic
Substance) Act, (as varied by the Regulations which are defined below and includes any revision thereof or amendment thereto from time
to time, the ES Law ), the International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) (Prescribed Dates) Regulations, 2018, the
International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations, 2019 and the International Co-Operation (Economic

A relevant entity conducting
any relevant activity must satisfy the economic substance test (the ES Test as set out in the ES Law. Failure to comply
with requirements of the ES Law may result in substantial fines and/or imprisonment. 

Considering SPI Energy is
a tax resident in US, the Company has determined that it is not a Relevant Entity for the purposes of the ES Law. 

U.S. Federal Income Taxation 

Introduction 

The following discussion is
a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ordinary shares. This discussion
applies only to holders that hold the ordinary shares as capital assets. This discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject
to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to specific
holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such
as banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, tax-exempt
entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships and the partners therein, dealers in securities
or currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, U.S. expatriates, persons who have acquired the ordinary shares as part
of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional
currency other than the U.S. dollar or persons that own (or are deemed to own) 5 or more of our stock. This discussion does not
address the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations
or, other than to the limited extent set forth below, any U.S. federal estate or gift tax considerations. 

As used in this discussion,
the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of the ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i)
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof, or the District of
Columbia, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust that (1) is
subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons or (2) has a valid
election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. 

As used in this discussion,
the term Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of the ordinary shares that is not a partnership (or entity treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and not a U.S. Holder. 

Treatment of the Company as a U.S. Corporation
for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes 

Even though we are organized
as a Cayman Islands exempted company, due to the application of Section 7874(b) of the Code, we are treated as a U.S. corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and all purposes under the Code. 

26 

U.S. Holders 

Distributions 

We do not currently anticipate
paying distributions on our ordinary shares. In the event that distributions are paid, however, the gross amount of such distributions
generally will be included in a U.S. Holder s gross income as dividend income on the date of receipt to the extent that the distribution
is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent
the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as so computed, it will be treated first as a
non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares and, to the extent the
amount of such distribution exceeds such adjusted tax basis, will be treated as gain from the sale of such ordinary shares. 

Subject to certain conditions,
including a minimum holding period requirement, dividends received by individuals and other non-corporate U.S. Holders, generally will
be subject to reduced rates of taxation, and dividends paid by us will be eligible for the dividends received deduction
generally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends received from U.S. corporations. 

Sale or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares 

A U.S. Holder generally will
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon a sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares in an amount equal
to the difference between the amount realized from such sale or disposition and the U.S. Holder s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary
shares. Such gain or loss generally will be a capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss (taxable at a reduced rate
for individuals and other non-corporate U.S. Holders) if, on the date of sale or disposition, such ordinary shares were held by such U.S.
Holder for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 

Non-U.S. Holders 

Distributions 

Distributions treated as dividends
(see -U.S. Holders-Distributions above) paid to a Non-U.S. Holder are treated as income derived from sources within the
United States and generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30 of the gross amount of such dividend, or
at a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty. 

Even if a Non-U.S. Holder
is eligible for a lower treaty rate, U.S. federal withholding tax will be imposed at a 30 rate (rather than the lower treaty rate) on
dividend payments to a Non-U.S. Holder, unless (i) the Non-U.S. Holder has furnished a valid U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other documentary evidence establishing such holder s entitlement to the lower treaty rate with respect
to such payments, and (ii) in the case of actual or constructive dividends paid to a foreign entity, (a) if such entity is, or holds the
ordinary shares through, a foreign financial institution, any such foreign financial institution (x) has entered into an agreement with
the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities information about its accountholders (including certain investors
in such institution), (y) satisfies an exemption from the obligation to enter into such an agreement, or (z) satisfies the terms of an
applicable intergovernmental agreement, and (b) if required, such entity has provided the withholding agent with a certification identifying
its direct and indirect U.S. owners. 

If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible
for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any
excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. 

27 

Sale or Other Disposition 

Any gain realized upon the
sale or other disposition of ordinary shares by a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless (i)
the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition,
and certain other conditions are met, or (ii) in the case of the sale or disposition of ordinary shares on or after January 1, 2019, the
requirements described in item (ii) in the second paragraph under -Distributions, above, are satisfied. Each Non-U.S. Holder
is encouraged to consult with its own tax advisor regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on its investment
in ordinary shares and the potential for a refund or credit in the case of any withholding tax. 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 

Payments of dividends or of
proceeds on the disposition of ordinary shares to U.S. Holders may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the
U.S. Holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and demonstrates this fact, or (ii) provides a correct
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules. Non-U.S. Holders may be required to provide documentary evidence establishing they are not subject to
information reporting and backup withholding. Payments of dividends to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of U.S. federal withholding tax
imposed on such dividends must generally be reported annually to the IRS. A similar report will be sent to Non-U.S. Holders. Copies of
these reports may be made available to tax authorities in a holder s country of residence. 

Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a holder s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. 

U.S. Federal Estate Tax 

Ordinary shares owned or treated
as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as specifically defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes)
at the time of death will be included in the individual s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes and may be subject to
U.S. federal estate tax unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 

Our business, financial condition
and results of operations are subject to various changing business, competitive, economic, political and social conditions worldwide.
In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report, the following are some of the important factors that could adversely
affect our operating results, financial condition and business prospects, and cause our actual results to differ materially from those
projected in any forward-looking statements. 

Risks Related to Our Company 

We have incurred net losses, experienced
net cash outflows from operating activities and recorded working capital deficits. If we do not effectively manage our cash and other
liquid financial assets and execute our liquidity plan, we may not be able to satisfy repayment requirements on our borrowings. 

We suffered net losses of
 44.8 million and 33.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also had an accumulated deficit of 670.8
million and a working capital deficit of 107.7 million as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we have substantial amounts of debt that
became due in 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Historically, we have financed
our operations primarily through cash flows from bank borrowings, financing from issuance of convertible bonds, operating activities and
proceeds from private placements and registered offerings. However if we failed to achieve the goal, we may need additional financing
to repay debt obligation and execute our business plan, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely
basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. Without access to sufficient level of capital from operations or through bank borrowings or other
sources, we may not be able to execute our growth strategy or pursue additional projects, or may not even be able to satisfy repayment
requirements on our borrowings. These uncertainties may create concerns for our creditors, suppliers, customers and other counterparties,
and cause them to make it more difficult for us to raise our financing, conduct our business and meet our debt and other obligations. 

Although we have formulated
a plan as summarized under Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report to continue implementing
various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses within an acceptable level, and other measures including negotiate
with potential buyers for sales of Solar PV projects, obtain equity financing from certain subsidiaries initial public offering
and seek credit facilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute this plan. The amount of liquidity that
we need may be greater than we currently anticipate as a result of additional factors and events beyond our control, such as global economic
slowdown, potential financial crises globally or in any region where we conduct a significant portion of our business, changes in the
regulatory and business environments, including international trade-related sanctions, which may prevent us from operating normally or
from effectively competing in the PV industry. All of these and other factors and occurrences may increase our cash requirements and make
us unable to satisfy repayment requirements on our borrowings. 

We have recognized the fact
that additional actions were needed to reposition our operations to minimize our cash outflows. Therefore, we undertook a number of initiatives
in order to conserve or generate cash on an incremental basis in 2022. For a detailed discussion of these initiatives and strategies,
please see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -B. Liquidity and
Capital Resources- Capital Resources and Material Known Facts on Liquidity. 

However, there is no assurance
that these initiatives and strategies will be successfully implemented, or even if successfully implemented, our cash position and our
operational efficiency will be improved. In the event that our business initiatives and strategies do not achieve the expected results,
our business, financial conditions, results of operations and liquidity position may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore,
we have identified several business related risk factors, such as compliance with laws and regulations, contingent liabilities arising
from litigations, suspected related party transactions and unusual transactions, which could cause cash position to further deteriorate. 

30 

We are in default on a number of our obligations,
which could result in our being forced to cease operations if we are unable to reach satisfactory settlement with applicable counterparties. 

We have outstanding convertible
bonds of 35.0 million under a convertible bond agreement Convertible Bond Agreement with certain bond holders, which
were defaulted in June 2016 and not repaid through December 31, 2022. We have also defaulted a 2.1 million convertible loan entered into
with Streeterville Capital, LLC as of as of the date of this annual report. 

If we are unable to reach
satisfactory settlement with applicable counterparties, we could be forced to cease operations. 

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We require a significant amount
of cash to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations, including payments to suppliers for PV modules and components and to
banks for project loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had 10.1 million in outstanding short-term borrowings (and the current portion
of long-term borrowings) and 6.6 million in outstanding long-term borrowings (excluding the current portion). 

Our existing debt may have
significant consequences on our operations, including: 

reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes as a result of our debt service obligations; 

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; 

making us more vulnerable to changes in our business, our industry and the general economy; 

potentially increasing the cost of any additional financing; and 

limiting our ability to make future acquisitions. 

Any of these factors and other
consequences that may result from our substantial indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our existing debt facilities. Our ability to meet our payment
obligations under our existing debt facilities depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent,
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our
control. 

31 

Our management has identified material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting and we may not be able to remediate these weaknesses. Additionally, our management may
identify material weaknesses in the future that could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our securities and increase
our cost of raising capital. 

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our Company s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, we noted the following
deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses: 

a. 
 Failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting; 

b. 
 Failure to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks; 

c. 
 Ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting; 

d. 
 Ineffective process-level controls associated with the revenue, purchasing and inventory, treasury, property and equipment, tax, and payroll processes that (a) addressed relevant risks, (b) provided sufficient evidence of performance, and (c) established appropriate segregation of duties, during the financial reporting processes; 

e. 
 Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with requisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP; and 

f. 
 Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented in IT environment and IT general control activities, which mainly associated with areas of logical access security, system change, computer operation and service organization control monitoring activities. Certain process-level automated controls and manual controls that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected information technology systems were also ineffective. 

As a result of the above
material weaknesses, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022. 

32 

To remediate the material
weaknesses described above, we plan to continue to establish a comprehensive and effective internal control system with the assistance
from third party consulting firm which shall provide relevant professional advisory services to us. We plan to continue to assess our
standardized processes to further enhance the effectiveness of our financial review, including the analysis and monitoring of financial
information in a consistent and thorough manner. The Company s remediation actions to be taken were highlighted as follows: 

a. 
 Strengthen overview and monitoring from the Company s governance, and set up the Company s internal audit department who reports to the audit committee directly, to ensure enhanced oversight over the Company s financial reporting function; 

b. 
 Engage a professional adviser to review, test and optimize the Company s internal control system, particularly focusing on the material weaknesses identified as above. 

c. 
 Launch and improve the internal control execution plan to supervise and monitor the operational functions; 

d. 
 Establish a formal and systematic risk assessment program and involve upper management to identify and analyze risks. 

e. 
 Provide our accounting team and other relevant personnel with more comprehensive guidelines and training on the policies and controls over financial reporting under U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and requirements 

f. 
 Strengthen the review controls on journal entries and accounting treatments and adjustment by providing our accounting team with more comprehensive guidelines on the policies and controls over financial reporting under U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and requirements. 

g. 
 Enhance management monitoring and review of key processes with more comprehensive guidelines on the policies and controls over financial reporting. 

h. 
 Strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of the independent and competent tax and accounting agencies. 

i. 
 Strengthen the supervision and controls on the IT functions, including the enhancement of logical security and monitor service provider. 

Any failure to remedy additional
weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that may be discovered in the future or to implement new or
improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail
to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect
the future ability of our management to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ineffective internal
control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information and subject us to civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation, which
could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. 

In addition, if we identify
additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could
reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, additional deficiencies could
result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley ). Such non-compliance
could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

33 

We rely substantially on our senior management
team and our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel for our current and future success. 

The industry experience, expertise
and contributions of our chairman, Mr. Xiaofeng Peng, is essential to our continuing success. We will continue to rely on our senior management,
regional management and other key employees to manage our business operations and implement our growth plans. If they cannot work together
effectively or efficiently, our business may be severely disrupted. If one or more of our senior or regional management personnel were
unable or unwilling to continue to hold their present positions, we might not be able to recruit, train and retain personnel with comparable
qualifications, and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

Our qualified and experienced
project development teams are critical to our success. We may not be able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel,
including executive officers, project development personnel, project management personnel and other key personnel with the necessary experience
and expertise. In particular, as we enter into new markets, we face challenges to recruit and retain qualified personnel who are familiar
with local regulatory regimes and have adequate experiences in project development and operations. In particular, we have experienced
a lack of accounting personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and experience in U.S. GAAP. 

There is substantial competition
for qualified personnel in the industries we operate. Our competitors may offer more competitive packages or otherwise attract our personnel.
Our costs to retain qualified personnel may also increase in response to competition. If we fail to continue to attract and retain a sufficient
number of personnel with suitable managerial, technical or marketing expertise, our business operations could be adversely affected and
our future growth and expansions may be inhibited. 

We have limited insurance coverage. 

Our insurance policies cover
employee-related accidents and injuries, property damage, machinery breakdowns, fixed assets, facilities and liability deriving from our
activities, including environmental liability. We consider our current insurance coverage to be adequate, but we cannot assure you that
our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject.
Furthermore, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which we are not fully
insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore,
due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will continue to
be available at comparable rates or on similar terms, if at all. We may also reduce or cancel our insurance coverage at any time. We may
not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates and we may elect to self-insure a portion
of our solar project portfolio. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. 

In addition, the insurance
industry in many parts of the world is still in an early stage of development. As we continue to expand our global presence, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in each of the new markets we enter. To the extent that our operations
are not adequately insured in these markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected. 

Changes to our business strategy provide
a limited history on which to base our prospects and anticipated results of operations. Our historical operating results may not serve
as an adequate basis to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations. 

For the past few years, we
have expanded our global project development business under our independent power producer model, or IPP model, or our build-and-transfer
model, or BT model, by ramping up our portfolio of solar projects. We entered into EV industry and roofing and solar system installation
industry by acquiring Phoenix and certain assets of PDI in 2020 and 2021. This limited operating history may not be a reliable indicator
of our future performance. 

34 

Given our limited operating
history under the current business model, we may not be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary
to grow these new business areas. We may invest considerable capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer
demands or otherwise fail to achieve satisfactory financial return. In particular, our results of operations, financial condition and
future success depend largely on our ability to continue to identify suitable projects that complement our solar project pipeline through
acquisitions and secondary development, as well as our ability to obtain the required regulatory approvals, financing and cost-effective
construction services for these acquisitions. We must also sustainably manage and operate the solar projects that we acquire, develop
and hold under our IPP model, or successfully identify buyers for solar projects under our BT model. The success of our EV business
depends on the development of new drive systems and new vans to attract customers, the supply of EV components and batteries as well as
the government policies and incentives. For the roofing and solar system installation, we must compete and obtain contracts from customers,
and have the ability the install and connect the roof solar. In addition, in expanding into these business areas, we may be competing
against companies that have substantially more experience than we do. If we are unable to achieve growth in these new business areas,
our overall growth and financial performance may be inferior to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted. 

Period-to-period comparisons
of our operating results and our results of operations for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of our performance for
any future period. We have incurred net losses since our inception, and, as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 670.8 million. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near future. 

We conduct our business in diverse
locations around the world and are subject to economic, regulatory, social and political risks internationally and in the regions where
we operate. 

We currently conduct our
business operations in the U.S., Japan, U.K., Greece, Italy, and Australia, and as of April 14, 2023, we own and operate 17.51
MW of solar projects and have 12.04MW of solar projects under construction across the world. Our business is therefore subject to
diverse and constantly changing economic, regulatory, social and political conditions in these markets. 

Operating internationally
exposes us to a number of risks globally and in each of the markets where we operate, including, without limitation: 

global economic and financial conditions, including the stability of credit markets, foreign currency exchange rates and their fluctuations; 

the supply and prices of other energy products such as oil, coal and natural gas in the relevant markets; 

changes in government regulations, policies, taxes and incentives, particularly those concerning the electric utility industry and the solar industry; 

reconciling heterogeneous, complex or contradictory regulations across different jurisdictions, international trade policies, including trade restrictions, embargoes and local sourcing or service requirements; 

political risks, including risks of expropriation and nationalization of assets, potential losses due to civil unrests, acts of terrorism and war, regional and global political or military tensions, strained or altered foreign relations; 

35 

compliance with diverse and complex local environmental, safety, health, labor and other laws and regulations, which can be onerous and costly, as the magnitude, complexity and continuous amendments to the laws and regulations are difficult to predict and liabilities, costs, obligations and requirements associated with these laws and regulations may be substantial; 

dependence on local governments, utility companies and other entities for electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and other utilities or infrastructure needs; 

difficulties associated with local operating and market conditions, particularly regarding customs, taxation and labor; 

difficulties for our senior management to effectively supervise local management teams in diverse locations; 

increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights and heightened risk of intellectual property disputes; 

failure of our contractual counter-parties to honor their obligations to us, and potential disputes with regulatory authorities, customers, contractors, suppliers, local residents or communities; 

obtaining fair access and legal remedies or benefits through local judicial or administrative bodies; and 

failure to adapt to effectively to local competitive environments. 

If economic recovery is slow
in the markets where we operate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely
affected. Moreover, as we expand into additional markets, we may face unfamiliar regulatory regimes, business practices, governmental
policies and industry conditions. As a result, our experience and knowledge of our existing markets may not be applicable to new markets
that we enter, requiring significant time and resources to adapt our business to these unfamiliar markets. To the extent that our diverse
business operations are affected by unexpected and adverse economic, regulatory, social and political conditions, we may experience business
disruptions, loss of assets and personnel and other indirect losses and our business, financial condition and results of operations both
locally and internationally could be materially and adversely affected. 

Risks Related to Our Solar Projects Business 

The reduction, modification, delay or discontinuation
of government subsidies and other economic incentives for the solar industry may reduce the profitability or viability of our solar projects
and materially adversely affect our business. 

At present, solar power is
not cost competitive with other energy sources in our existing markets and the new markets we plan to expand into. For a variety of technological
and economic reasons, the cost of generating electricity from solar energy in these markets currently exceeds and, absent significant
changes in technological or economic circumstances, will continue to exceed the cost of generating electricity from conventional and certain
other competing energy sources. Therefore, government subsidies and incentives, primarily in the form of feed-in tariffs, or FIT, price
support schemes, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar
products are generally required to enable companies such as us to successfully operate in these markets. 

36 

Government subsidies and incentives
vary by geographic market. The availability and size of such subsidies and incentives depend, to a large extent, on political and policy
developments relating to environmental concerns and other macro-economic factors. These government subsidies and incentives are expected
to gradually decrease in scope or be discontinued as solar power technology improves and becomes more affordable relative to other types
of energy. Reductions have occurred in certain countries where we have operations, and subsidies and incentives may be further reduced
or discontinued in countries where we currently or intend to operate. Reductions may apply retroactively to existing solar projects, which
could significantly reduce the value of our existing solar projects and other businesses. Even if reductions in government subsidies and
economic incentives apply only to future solar projects, our operations in that country could be materially and adversely affected as
we would not be able to leverage our existing presence to drive further growth. Moreover, certain solar subsidies and incentives are designed
to expire or decline over time, are limited in total funding, require renewal from regulatory authorities or impose certain investment
or performance criteria on our business partners or us, which we may not be able to satisfy. In addition, we may not be able to upgrade
our technologies rapidly enough to compensate for foreseeable reductions in government subsidies and incentives. As a result, a significant
reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive programs in our existing and target markets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

The significant period of time between our
upfront investments in solar projects and their commencement of revenue generation could materially and adversely affect our liquidity,
business and results of operations. 

There is a significant gap
between the time that we make significant upfront investments in the solar projects and the time that we receive any revenue from the
electricity generated by these solar projects after grid connection (under our IPP model) or from the sale of these projects (under our
BT model). These upfront investments include, among others, legal, accounting and other professional fees, costs associated with feasibility
studies and due diligence, payments for land use rights, construction costs, government permits and deposits for grid connection agreements
and PPAs, none of which may be refundable if a project fails to achieve completion. We have historically relied on private placements,
bank loans and financial leases to cover costs and expenses incurred during project development. 

In particular, there could
be an especially long gap between the initial assessment of a project, the first steps of acquiring land use rights and negotiating interconnection
agreements and the obtaining of governmental approvals for construction. Acquisition of land use rights can be particularly time-consuming
if we are engaged in primary development and need to negotiate with land owners or government entities. The significant development time
increases the risk for adverse events during such process, whether they be economic, environmental, political, social or otherwise, that
could cause further delays in project development or increase the overall development costs. Due to such adverse developments or unanticipated
delays, we may be unable to recoup our initial investment in the solar projects, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity,
profitability and results of operations. 

In addition, we will need
to hire and train additional project development personnel to manage our growing portfolio of IPP and BT projects. If we are unable to
manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies successfully
or respond to competitive pressures. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected. 

37 

The market for solar project development
is highly competitive. 

There is currently intense
competition in the solar industry, particularly in the downstream project development segment. Solar projects encounter competition from
utilities, industrial companies and other independent power producers. In recent years, there has been increasing competition for the
award of PPAs, which has in some markets resulted in an excess supply above designated reserve margins and has been contributing to the
declining electricity prices in many markets. In light of these conditions, we may not be able to obtain PPAs for our new solar projects
under our IPP model, and we may not be able to renew PPAs on the same terms and conditions upon expiration, particularly in terms of securing
an electricity sale price that enables profitable operation or the sale of a project at anticipated value, if at all. 

We have expanded our business
to include global project development and may not have the same level of expertise and customer base as our competitors, which may affect
our ability to successfully establish our presence in the global market. Our current or potential competitors may have greater operational,
financial, technical, market share, scale, management or other resources than us in our existing or target markets. Our competitors may
also enter into strategic alliances with other competitors to our detriment, or may ally with our suppliers or contractors, thereby limiting
our procurement choices and our flexibility in project development. Our current or potential competitors may offer PV solutions comparable
or superior to ours at the same or lower prices, or adapt more quickly to industry trends than we do. Increased competition may result
in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share. 

We may not be able to obtain long-term contracts
for the sale of electricity generated by our solar projects under our IPP model at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing
and other investments. 

Obtaining long-term contracts
for the sale of electricity generated by our solar projects under our IPP model at prices and on other terms favorable to us will be essential
for obtaining financing or completing construction of these projects. We must compete for PPAs against other developers of solar and renewable
energy projects. Furthermore, other sources of power, such as natural gas-fired power plants, have historically been cheaper than the
cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects, such as natural gas-fired power plants, can be delivered on a firm basis.
The availability of PPAs is subject to a number of economic, regulatory, tax and public policy factors. The inability to compete successfully
against other power producers or otherwise enter into PPAs favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance
our projects and negatively impact our revenue. 

Our solar projects have short operating
histories and may not perform up to our expectations. 

The projects in our solar
project portfolio are relatively new with expected operating life of more than 20 years. The majority of our projects in operation as
of December 31, 2022 commenced operations since 2014. In addition, the projects we acquire in the future may not have commenced construction
or operation or otherwise have a limited operating history. As a result, our assumptions and estimates regarding the future performance
of these projects are, and will be, made without the benefit of a meaningful operating history, which may impair our ability to accurately
assess the potential profitability of the projects. The performance of these projects will also be subject to risks inherent in newly
constructed renewable energy projects, including breakdowns and outages, latent defects, equipment that performs below our expectations
and system failures. Failure of some or all of our projects to perform up to our expectations could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

38 

Our results of operations may be subject
to fluctuations. 

Before we achieve economies
of scale in terms of our IPP projects and receive steady electricity generation income, our revenue in a given period will depend on the
number of solar projects sold under our BT model and sale of PV modules and solar component, and therefore is subject to significant fluctuations.
For instance, we may generate a significant portion of our revenues from the one-time sale of solar projects for certain periods. Moreover,
certain aspects of our operations will also be subject to seasonal variations. For example, we may schedule significant construction activities
to connect solar projects to the grids prior to a scheduled decrease in FIT rates in order to qualify for more favorable FIT policies. 

We may be subject to unforeseen costs, liabilities
or obligations when providing O M services. 

We provide ongoing O M
services to third-party solar projects under fixed-price long-term service agreements, pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled
and unscheduled maintenance and operating and other asset management services for the system. Our costs to perform these services are
estimated at the time of entering into the O M agreement for a particular project, and these are reflected in the fixed-price that
we charge our customers under the O M agreement. Should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur (including those due to unexpected
increases in inflation or labor costs), our O M services may not be profitable and our growth strategy and results of operations could
be adversely affected. Because of the long-term nature of these O M agreements, the adverse impacts on results of operations could
be significant, particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an above- market liability cap under the terms of the O M
agreement. In addition, we may be subject to substantial costs, liabilities or obligations in the event that the solar projects we maintain
and operate do not meet any agreed-upon system-level availability or performance warranties. 

Warranties provided by our suppliers and
contractors may be limited or insufficient to compensate for our losses, or may not cover the nature of our losses incurred. 

We expect to benefit from
various warranties, including product quality and performance warranties, provided by our suppliers and contractors. These suppliers and
contractors, however, may file for bankruptcy, cease operations or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their warranty obligations.
Even if a supplier fulfills its warranty obligations, the warranty may not be sufficient to compensate us for all of our losses. In addition,
the warranty for inverters and transformers generally expire after 5 to 10 years from the date such equipment is delivered or commissioned
and is subject to liability limits. Where damages are caused by defective products provided by our suppliers or construction services
delivered by our contractors, our suppliers or contractors may be unable or unwilling to perform their warranty obligations as a result
of their financial conditions or otherwise. Or if the warranty has expired or a liability limit has been reached, there may be a reduction
or loss of warranty protection for the affected projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Solar energy generation depends heavily
on suitable meteorological conditions. If weather conditions are unfavorable, our power generation output, and therefore the revenue from
our solar projects, may be substantially below our expectations. 

The electricity produced and
revenues generated by solar projects are highly dependent on suitable solar conditions and associated weather conditions. Such conditions
are beyond our control. Furthermore, components of these generation systems, including solar panels and inverters, can be damaged by severe
weather, such as heavy snowstorms, hailstorms, ice storms, lightning strikes, extreme winds, earthquakes or tornadoes. Replacement and
spare parts for key components may be difficult costly or unavailable. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could reduce the
electricity output of our solar projects to below projected generation, damage or impair the effectiveness of our projects or require
shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of our projects and our ability to achieve forecasted revenues and cash flows. 

39 

The amount of electricity
solar projects produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or insolation, where the projects are located. Because shorter
daylight hours in winter months results in less insolation, the generation of particular projects will vary depending on the season. 

We base our investment decisions
with respect to solar power generation assets on the findings of related solar studies conducted prior to construction or based on historical
conditions at existing projects. However, actual climatic conditions at an asset site may not conform to the findings of these studies.
For example, unexpected development of climate conditions that was not taken into consideration during the investment decision-making
process, such as smog and sand storms may significantly reduce the solar power generation. Therefore, our solar projects may not meet
anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of our projects, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows. 

The operation of solar projects involves
significant inherent risks and hazards that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. 

The operation of solar projects
involves numerous hazardous activities, including delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. We are subject to natural
disasters such as earthquakes, floods, snow obscuration, high temperatures, lightning, hurricanes, long-term climate changes, volcanoes
and wind risks, as well as other inherent risks affecting resource availability such as fire, explosion, soil and ice buildup, structural
collapse and equipment failure. Moreover, we may suffer from negligent acts by our PPA counterparties or other third parties. Our rooftop
projects could cause damage to the building roof, resulting in claims due to water damages or replacement of roofing materials. These
and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to, and destruction of, property and equipment
and contamination of, or damage to, the environment, wildlife takes or fatalities and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any
of these events may result in lawsuits against us asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs,
personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. 

In addition, the ongoing operation
of solar projects face risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output
or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among others. Unplanned outages,
including extensions of scheduled outages, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically
increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of generating and selling less electricity. 

If we fail to properly operate
and maintain our solar projects, these projects may experience decreased performance, shortened operating life or shut downs. Our solar
projects may also require periodic upgrading and improvement. Changes in our own operation or local conditions may increase the costs
of operating the project, including costs related to labor, equipment, insurance and taxes. If we cause damage to third parties, we may
become liable for the consequences of any resulting damage. We may also experience equipment malfunction or failure, leading to unexpected
maintenance needs, unplanned outages or other operational issues. In addition, inconsistencies in the quality of solar panels, PV modules,
balance-of-system components or maintenance services for our solar projects may affect the system efficiency of our projects. 

Any unexpected operational
or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, and any decreased operational or management performance,
could reduce our solar projects power generating capacity below expected levels, reducing our revenues and profitability. Degradation
of the performance of our solar projects above levels provided for in the relevant PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital
expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our projects may also reduce our profitability. In addition, damage to
our reputation due to system failure or accidents could negatively impact our relationships with customers and local government authorities,
which could also materially adversely affect our business. Negative public or community response to solar energy projects could adversely
affect the approval for and construction of our projects. We maintain insurance coverage that we consider adequate but we cannot assure
you that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may
be subject. 

40 

We may encounter unexpected difficulties
when developing solar power projects. 

The development of solar projects
involves numerous risks and uncertainties and require extensive research, planning and due diligence. Before we can determine whether
a solar project is economically, technologically or otherwise feasible, we may be required to incur significant capital expenditure for
land and interconnection rights, preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other work. Success in developing a particular solar project
is contingent upon, among others: 

securing the rights to suitable project locations with access to the grid, necessary rights of way, and satisfactory land use permissions; 

rezoning land, as necessary, to support a solar project; 

negotiating and receiving on schedule the required permits and approvals for project development from government authorities; 

completing all required regulatory and administrative procedures needed to obtain permits and agreements; 

obtaining rights to interconnect the solar project to the grid or to transmit energy; 

paying interconnection and other deposits, some of which are non-refundable; 

negotiating favorable payment terms with module and other equipment suppliers and contractors; 

signing PPAs or other off-take arrangements that are commercially acceptable and adequate for providing financing; 

obtaining construction financing, including debt financing and equity contributions, as appropriate; and 

satisfactorily completing construction on schedule. 

Successful completion of a particular solar
project may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including, without limitation: 

unanticipated delays or changes in project plans; 

changes to laws and regulations requiring additional permits, licenses and approvals, or difficulties in obtaining and maintaining existing governmental permits, licenses and approvals; 

the inability to obtain adequate financing with acceptable terms; 

41 

unforeseeable engineering problems, construction or other unexpected delays and contractor performance issues; 

delays, disruptions or shortages of the supply of labor, equipment and materials, including work stoppages; 

defective PV module or other components sourced from our suppliers; 

adverse weather, environmental and geological conditions, force majeure and other events out of our control; and 

cost overruns due to any one or more of the foregoing factors. 

Accordingly, some of the solar
projects in our portfolio may not eventually commence operation and connect to the grid, or even proceed to construction. If a number
of our solar projects are not completed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. 

We rely on third-party suppliers and contractors
when developing our solar power projects. 

We source PV modules and other
balance-of-system components from a wide selection of third-party suppliers and engage third-party contractors for the construction of
solar projects. We typically enter into contracts with our suppliers and contractors on a project-by-project basis and do not maintain
long-term contracts with our suppliers or contractors. Therefore, we are generally exposed to price fluctuations and availability of PV
modules and balance-of-system components sourced from our suppliers and construction services procured from our contractors. For example,
in light of changing market dynamics and government policies, the price and availability of PV modules have been subject to significant
volatility in recent years. Increases in the prices of PV modules or balance- of-system components, decreases in their availability, fluctuations
in construction, labor and installation costs, or changes in the terms of our relationship with our suppliers and contractors may increase
the cost of procuring equipment and engaging contractors and hence materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. 

Furthermore, the delivery
of defective products or products or construction services by our suppliers or contractors which are otherwise not in compliance with
contract specifications, or the late supply of products or construction services, may cause construction delays or solar power projects
that fail to adhere to our quality and safety standards, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow. 

Our construction activities may be subject
to cost overruns or delays. 

We engage third-party contractors
for the construction of solar projects. Construction of solar projects involves numerous risks and uncertainties, and may be adversely
affected by circumstances outside of our control, including seasonal changes, inclement weather, failure to receive regulatory approvals
on schedule or third-party delays in supplying PV modules or other materials. We may not be able to negotiate satisfactory construction
agreements with third-party contractors, or our third-party contractors may not be able to contract with their subcontractors on a timely
basis. In addition, if our contractors fail to adhere to our quality standards or otherwise fail to meet their contractual obligations,
or if there is a shortage of contractors or labor strikes that prevents our contractors from completing their construction work on schedule
or within budget, the solar projects may experience significant delays or cost overruns. Increases in the prices of solar products and
components may also increase our procurement costs. Labor shortages, work stoppages and labor disputes could significantly delay a project
or otherwise increase our costs. In addition, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain required construction permits could also delay
or hinder the construction of our solar projects. A lack of proper construction permits, or post-construction approvals could delay or
prevent our solar projects from commencing operation and connecting to the grid. 

42 

We may not be able to recover
any of our losses resulting from construction cost overruns or delays. In addition, since the FIT applicable to a solar project generally
depends on its lead time to grid connection, construction and connection delays may lead to a lower-than-expected FIT, which would adversely
affect the long-term value and potentially the viability of the project. Many PPAs also require our solar projects to connect to the grid
by a certain date. If the construction of solar project is significantly delayed, we may be in violation of our PPAs or may only be entitled
to reduced FIT payments, if at all. A reduction or forfeiture of FIT payments would materially and adversely affect the profitability
for a solar power project. Any of the above contingencies could lead to our failure to generate expected return from our solar projects
and result in unanticipated and significant revenue and earnings losses. 

The solar industry faces competition from
both conventional power industries and other renewable power industries. 

The solar industry faces intense
competition from all other players within the energy industry, including both conventional energy providers such as nuclear, natural gas
and fossil fuels and other renewable energy providers, such as geothermal, hydropower, biomass, wind and nuclear energy. Other energy
sources may benefit from innovations that reduce their costs and increase safety, and therefore improve their competitiveness. New natural
resources may be discovered, or global economic, business or political developments may disproportionately benefit conventional energy
sources or other renewable energy sources at the expense of solar. Governments may strengthen their support for other renewable energy
sources and reduce their support for the solar industry. Changes in supply and demand of conventional energy sources or other energy sources
may reduce the cost of such sources and render solar power less attractive. The decline in oil prices would adversely impacted the competitiveness
of solar energy. Failure for our customers, other business partners or us to compete with the providers of other energy sources may materially
and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We may not be able to acquire additional
solar projects to grow our project portfolio or effectively integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. 

Our current business strategy
includes plans to further increase the number of solar projects we own and operate. We have significantly expanded our operations through
acquisitions of solar projects across different development stages in Japan, the U.S., the U.K., Greece and Italy, and we may acquire
additional businesses, products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives in the future. Accordingly,
our ability to execute our expansion strategies depends on our ability to identify suitable investment or acquisition opportunities, which
is subject to numerous uncertainties. We may not be able to identify favorable geographical markets for expansion or assess local demand
for solar power, identify a sufficient number of projects as contemplated, or secure project financing and refinancing on reasonable terms
for the contemplated acquisitions. In addition, our competitors may have substantially greater capital and other resources than we do,
and may be able to pay more for the acquisition targets we identify and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and acquire a greater
number of projects than our resources permit. 

Furthermore, we may not realize
the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and each transaction involves numerous risks, including, among others: 

difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business; 

difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired assets, technologies or products with our operations; 

difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration; 

disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management from daily operations; 

inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel and key customers, suppliers and other business partners of the acquired business; 

inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses as a result of insufficient capital resources or otherwise; 

43 

incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results; 

potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, legal and financial liabilities, among others; 

potential failure to comply with local regulatory requirements or to obtain construction, environmental and other permits and approvals from governmental authorities in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions; and 

potential failure to connect the acquired solar projects to the local grid on schedule and within budget, to ensure sufficient grid capacity for the life of the solar projects, or to collect FIT payments and other economic incentives as expected from local government authorities. 

Acquisitions of companies
are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not generate expected economic returns from the acquired businesses, or become responsible
for any preexisting liabilities related to the acquired businesses, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We may fail to comply with laws and regulations
in the markets we operate. 

The development, construction
and operation of solar projects are highly regulated. We conduct our operations in many jurisdictions and are subject to different laws
and regulations, including national and local regulations relating to building codes, taxes, safety, environmental protection, utility
interconnection, metering and other matters. Our establish subsidiaries also have operations in these countries and jurisdictions that
are required to comply with various local laws and regulations. While we strive to work with our local counsel and other advisers to comply
with the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction where we operate, there have been, and may continue to be, instances of non-compliances
such as late filings of annual accounts with the appropriate governmental authorities, failure to notify governmental authorities of certain
transactions, failure to hold annual meetings as required, failure to register director or address changes or other local requirements
which may result in fines, sanctions or other penalties against our non-complying subsidiaries and its directors and officers. While we
do not believe our past and continuing non-compliances, singularly or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations, we cannot assure you that similar or other non-compliances will not occur in the future
which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We are responsible for obtaining
a variety of approvals, permits and licenses from various authorities for our solar projects. The procedures for obtaining such approvals,
permits and licenses vary from country to country, making it onerous and costly to adhere to the varying requirements and standards of
individual localities. Failure to obtain the required approvals, permits or licenses or to comply with the conditions associated therewith
may result in fines, sanctions, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of approvals, permits or licenses, or even criminal liabilities,
which could material and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new government regulations
pertaining to our business or solar projects may result in significant additional expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to promptly and adequately respond to changes of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, or that our employees and contractors
will act in accordance with our internal policies and procedures. Failure to comply with laws and regulations where we develop, own and
operate solar projects may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market demand
for solar power is strongly influenced by government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as by policies
promulgated by electric utilities in each of the markets we operate. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing
and technical interconnection of electricity generation. Customer purchases of alternative energy sources, including solar power technology,
could be deterred by these regulations and policies, which may significantly reduce the demand for our PV solutions. For example, without
a regulatory-mandated exception for solar power systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting
distributed power generation on the electric utility grid or limit the production capacity to the grid. The county-level government may
also levy additional tax related to land use or potential plants recovery that was not initially included during the development or construction
phase. These fees could increase, rendering solar power less cost competitive in these markets and our PV solutions less desirable. 

44 

It is difficult to ensure
ongoing compliance with the changing requirements of individual markets. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining
to solar projects may result in significant additional expenses to us or other industry participants and as a result could cause a significant
reduction in demand for our PV solutions. 

Environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations subject us to extensive and increasingly stringent operational requirements, as well as potentially substantial liabilities
arising out of environmental contamination. 

We are subject to, in each
of the jurisdictions we operate, numerous national and local laws, regulations, guidelines, policies, directives and other requirements
governing or relating to, among others, land use and zoning matters and protection of human health and the environment, including those
limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment, and the protection of certain wildlife. These laws and regulations
require our solar projects to, among others, obtain and maintain approvals and permits, undergo environmental impact assessments and review
processes and implement environmental, health and safety programs and procedures to control risks associated with the construction, operation
and decommissioning of solar projects. If our solar projects do not comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or permit requirements,
we may be required to pay significant fines or penalties or suspend or cease operations of the affected projects. Violations of environmental
and other laws, regulations and permit requirements may also result in criminal sanctions or injunctions. 

Our solar projects may experience
malfunctions and other unplanned events that result in personal injury and property damage. As such, the operation of our projects carries
an inherent risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities (including potential civil actions, compliance or remediation orders,
fines and other penalties), and may subject us to administrative and judicial proceedings. In addition, certain environmental laws and
regulations may impose joint and several liability on past and present owners and operators of sites, related to the cleaning up of sites
where hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released. 

Technological advances in the solar industry
could render our PV solutions uncompetitive or obsolete. 

The solar industry is characterized
by its rapid adoption and application of technological advances. This requires us to develop new PV solutions and enhance our existing
PV solutions to keep pace with and respond effectively to evolving technologies, market conditions and customer demands. Our competitors
may develop technologies more advanced and cost-effective than ours. We will need to invest substantially in research and development
to maintain our market position and effectively compete in the future. Our failure to further refine or enhance our technologies could
render our technologies uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our revenues to decline. 

In addition, we may invest
in and implement newly-developed, less-proven technologies in our project development or in maintaining or enhancing our existing projects.
There is no guarantee that these new technologies will perform or generate customer demand as anticipated. The failure of our new technologies
to perform as anticipated may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

45 

If demand for solar projects develops more
slowly than we anticipate, develops in ways inconsistent with our strategy, or fails to develop at all, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 

The solar power market worldwide
is at a relatively early stage of development compared to conventional power markets and other renewable power markets, such as that for
hydropower. Thus, trends in the solar industry are based only on limited data and may be unreliable. Many factors may affect the demand
for solar projects worldwide, including: 

the cost and availability of project financing for solar projects; 

fluctuations in economic and market conditions that improve the viability of competing energy sources; 

the cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of solar projects compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources; 

the availability of grid capacity allocated to solar power; 

political opposition to solar power due to environmental, land use, safety or other local concerns; 

the availability of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar industry; 

public perceptions of the utility, necessity and importance of solar power and other renewable energies; 

the success of other alternative energy generation technologies, such as fuel cells, wind power and biomass; and 

utility and grid regulations that present unique technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the development, transmission and use of solar energy. 

Our analysis and predictions
concerning the future growth of the solar industry are based on complex facts and circumstances and may be incorrect. If market demand
for solar projects in our existing or target markets fails to develop according to our expectations, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our growth prospects and future profitability
and our ability to continue to acquire solar projects depends on the availability of sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us. 

The development of solar projects
requires significant upfront cash investments, including the costs of permit development, construction and associated operations. Since
2014, we have been expanding our solar project portfolio primarily by acquiring solar projects across different development stages. Such
expansion strategy requires significant upfront capital expenditures which, depending on the respective development stages of the acquired
projects, may not be recouped for a significant period of time. As a result, we are required to pursue a wide variety of capital resources
to fund our operations, including private placements, bank loans, financial leases and other third-party financing options. 

46 

Our ability to obtain sufficient
financing is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: 

our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; 

the general condition and liquidity of global equity and debt capital markets; 

local regulatory and government support for solar power in markets where we operate, such as through tax credits and FIT schemes; 

the availability of credit lines from banks and other financial institutions; 

economic, political, social and other conditions in the markets where we operate; 

our level of indebtedness and ability to comply with financial covenants under our debt financing; and 

tax and securities laws which may hamper our ability to raise capital. 

Due to these or other reasons,
we may not be successful in obtaining the required funds for future acquisitions. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance our bank
borrowings on favorable terms, or at all, upon the expiration or termination of our existing loan facilities. In addition, rising interest
rates could adversely affect our ability to secure financing on favorable terms. Our failure in securing suitable financing sources in
a timely manner or at all, or on commercially acceptable terms, could significantly limit our ability to execute our growth strategies
or future acquisitions, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Risks Related to Our America Solar Module Manufacturing
Business 

We face risks associated with the international
manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products and the construction and operation of our US manufacturing facilities,
and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business and operations abroad may be adversely affected and our ability to
maintain, develop and expand our business in the US may be restricted. 

We commenced pilot production
of Made-in-America solar modules under the Solar4America brand in June 2022. Currently, we sublease existing solar module
manufacturing facilities with a total floor area of 195,100 square feet located in McClellan Park, California. We acquired solar module
manufacturing equipment assets from Sunergy California LLC, and we have assembled a manufacturing team to commence production. We have
entered into purchase and other agreements for purchase of additional manufacturing equipment and expansion of our production capacities,
and expected that our production capacity will expand to approximately 650MW solar modules per year by the end of 2022 once all of the
solar module assembly equipment is fully assembled and operational. We expect the production capacity will be further increased to 1,100MW
per year by the end of 2023. We plan to promote our products from this factory, as Made-in-America, which we expect to appeal
to certain customers and to qualify for government Buy America programs. 

47 

The manufacturing, marketing,
distribution and sale of our products in the US, as well as the construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities in the US may
expose us to a number of risks, including those associated with: 

costs associated with understanding local markets and trends; 

costs associated with establishment of US manufacturing facilities; 

marketing and distribution costs; 

customer services and support costs; 

risk management and internal control structures for our US operations; 

compliance with the different commercial, operational, environmental and legal requirements; 

obtaining or maintaining certifications for production, marketing, distribution and sales of our products and services; 

maintaining our reputation as an environmentally friendly enterprise for our products or services; 

obtaining, maintaining or enforcing intellectual property rights; 

changes in prevailing economic conditions and regulatory requirements; 

transportation and freight costs; 

employing and retaining manufacturing, technology, sales and other personnel who can function effectively in US markets; 

trade barriers such as trade remedies, which could increase the prices of the raw materials for our solar products, and export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries; 

challenges due to our unfamiliarity with local laws, regulations and policies, our absence of significant operating experience in local market, increased costs associated with establishment of overseas operations and maintaining a multinational organizational structure; and 

other risks that are beyond our control. 

Our management team has no
experience in operating a module manufacturing factory in the US, which will be a unique business line in addition to the distribution,
installation and product development businesses that we operate. The new CRM/ERP systems that we are implementing in the US may not be
suitable for a manufacturing factory. We cannot assure that the management team will be able to operate the manufacturing factory successfully
or generate enough profit or cash flow from it to justify the capital investments. 

We will face different business
environments and industry conditions in the domestic solar module assembly and sale business, and we may spend substantial resources familiarizing
ourselves with the new environment and conditions. Our business operations might be affected by unexpected and adverse economic, regulatory,
social and political conditions in the jurisdictions in which we have operations, we may experience project disruptions, loss of assets
and personnel, and other indirect losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
manufacturing facility in the United States might expose us to various risks, including, among others, failure to obtain the required
approvals, permits or licenses, or to comply with the conditions associated therewith, failure to procure economic incentives or financing
on satisfactory terms, and failure to procure construction materials, production equipment and qualified personnel for the manufacturing
facility in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any of these events may increase the related costs, or impair our ability to run our operations
in the future on a cost-effective basis, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

48 

Compliance with
environmentally safe production and construction and renewable energy development regulations can be costly, while non-compliance with
such regulations might result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages, fines and suspension of our business
operations. 

In connection with SJ Technology s
solar module assembly business, we are required to comply with all national and local environmental protection regulations for our operations
in the United States, and some of our subsidiaries must obtain and maintain pollution discharge permits or registrations, or are in the
process of application for such permits and registrations, which are subject to application, renewal or extension on an annual basis or
within a longer period. We cannot assure you that we are or will be able to successfully obtain, renew or extend these permits in a timely
manner or at all. 

SJ Technology, uses, stores
and generates volatile and otherwise dangerous chemicals and wastes during our manufacturing processes, and is subject to a variety of
government regulations related to the use, storage and disposal of such hazardous chemicals and waste. We are also required to obtain
construction permits before commencing constructing production facilities. Although we will try to take measures to prevent environmental
incidents from occurring in the future, we cannot assure you that our operations will not be disrupted by the environmental incidents.
We note that the relevant authorities might issue more stringent environmental protection, safety production and construction regulations
that might impact our domestic manufacturing facilities, and the costs of compliance with new regulations could be substantial. If we
fail to comply with the future environmentally safe production and construction laws and regulations, we might be required to pay fines,
suspend construction or production, or cease operations, and any failure by us to properly manage the discharge of dangerous substances
could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or the suspension of our business operations.

Debt and Collections Risks : 

We may have to secure payments
for certain consumer solar or battery sales but there is no assurance that such payments will be timely collected. We have also enhanced
our collection efforts and undertaken various measures to collect outstanding payments from customers and may suffer damages as a result
of legal actions and other payments due to us. 

We currently conduct our business
operations in Australia. We are in approximately 9 locations in Australia including offices/warehouse and storage facilities. Our business
is therefore subject to diverse and constantly changing economic, regulatory, social and political conditions in these areas including
the following: 

local, national and international economic and financial conditions, including the stability of credit markets, foreign currency exchange rates and their fluctuations; 

the supply and prices of construction materials and other energy products such as oil, coal and natural gas in their relevant markets; 

changes in government regulations, policies, taxes and incentives, particularly those concerning the electric utility industry, the solar industry and the construction industry; 

reconciling heterogeneous, complex or contradictory regulations across different jurisdictions, international trade policies, including trade restrictions, embargoes and local sourcing or service requirements; 

political risks, including risks of expropriation and nationalization of assets, potential losses due to civil unrests, acts of terrorism and war, regional and global political or military tensions, strained or altered foreign relations; 

compliance with diverse and complex local environmental, safety, health, labor and other laws and regulations, which can be onerous and costly, as the magnitude, complexity and continuous amendments to the laws and regulations are difficult to predict and liabilities, costs, obligations and requirements associated with these laws and regulations may be substantial; 

dependence on local governments, utility companies and other entities for electricity, water, telecommunications, transportation and other utilities or infrastructure needs; 

49 

difficulties associated with local operating and market conditions, particularly regarding customs, taxation and workforce labor; 

difficulties for our senior management to effectively supervise local management and installation teams in diverse locations; 

increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual and privacy property rights and heightened risk of intellectual property disputes; 

failure of our contractual counter-parties to honor their obligations to us, and potential disputes with regulatory authorities, customers, contractors, suppliers, local residents or communities; 

obtaining fair access and legal remedies or benefits through local judicial or administrative bodies; and 

failure to adapt to effectively to local competitive environments. 

Our sales may be subject to risks associated
with construction, delays and other contingencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and the results
of operations. 

Historically, we have generated
a significant portion of our revenue from sales of PV products. We generally enter into a sales contract under which we act as the supplier
in connection with the supply of solar and battery systems. In addition, delays in supply of PV module or components, construction delays,
pandemic delays, labor, unexpected performance problems in electricity generation or other events may cause us unanticipated and severe
revenue and earnings losses and financial penalties. 

We rely on suppliers when selling our solar
and battery products and may see delays and/or cancellations. 

We source PV modules and other
balance-of-system components from a wide selection of third-party suppliers. Therefore, we are generally exposed to price fluctuations
and availability of PV modules and balance-of-system components sourced from our suppliers. For example, in light of changing market dynamics
and government policies, the price and availability of PV modules and other solar materials have been subject to significant volatility
in recent years. Increases in the prices of PV modules or balance-of-system components, decreases in their availability, fluctuations
in construction, labor and installation costs, or changes in the terms of our relationship with our third party installers and suppliers
may increase the cost of procuring equipment and hence materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Warranties provided by our third party installers
and contractors may be limited or insufficient to compensate for our losses, or may not cover the nature of our losses incurred. 

We expect to benefit from
various warranties, including product quality and performance warranties, provided by our installers and contractors. These suppliers
and contractors, however, may file for bankruptcy, cease operations or otherwise become unable or unwilling to fulfill their warranty
obligations. Even if a supplier fulfills its warranty obligations, the warranty may not be sufficient to compensate us for all of our
losses. In addition, the warranty for inverters and transformers may expire after such equipment is delivered or commissioned and/or is
subject to liability limits. Where damages are caused by defective products provided by our suppliers or construction services delivered
by our contractors, our suppliers or contractors may be unable or unwilling to perform their warranty obligations as a result of their
financial conditions or otherwise. Or if the warranty has expired or a liability limit has been reached, there may be a reduction or loss
of warranty protection for the affected projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

50 

We may be subject to product or strict liability
claims if the provision of our services or the solar projects we sell result in injury or damage, and we have limited insurance coverage
to protect against such claims, as well as losses that may result from business interruptions or natural disasters. 

Solar projects are highly
sophisticated and generate and transfer large volumes of electric charge with the potential to harm or kill, whether by improper installation
or other causes. We are therefore exposed to an inherent risk of product liability claims or class action suits in the event that the
installation of the solar power systems during the provision of our services, or the solar projects we sell under our business model,
results in injury or damage, and we may even be liable in some jurisdictions under a strict liability theory, where liability holds even
if we are not negligent or at fault. Moreover, to the extent that a claim is brought against us, we may not have adequate resources to
defend ourselves. We rely on our general liability insurance to cover product liability and other liability claims and have not separately
obtained product liability insurance. The unfavorable settlement of product or strict liability claims against us could result in significant
monetary damages and significant payments in excess of our insurance coverage could have a materially adverse effect on our financial
results. Any such business disruption could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. 

Risks Related to Our Residential Roofing and Solar Installation
Business 

The solar energy industry is a new and evolving
market, which may not grow to the size or at the rate we expect. 

The solar energy industry
is a new and rapidly growing market opportunity. We believe the solar energy industry will continue still take several years to fully
develop and mature, but we cannot be certain that the market will grow to the size or at the rate that we expect. Any future growth of
the solar energy market and the success of our solar service offerings depend on many factors beyond our control, including recognition
and acceptance of the solar service market by consumers, the pricing of alternative sources of energy, a favorable regulatory environment,
the continuation of expected tax benefits and other incentives, and our ability to provide our solar service offerings cost-effectively,
and our business might be adversely affected should the markets for solar energy do not develop to the size or at the rate we expect. 

Solar energy has yet to achieve
broad market acceptance and depends in part on continued support in the form of rebates, tax credits, and other incentives from federal,
state and local governments. If this support diminishes materially, our ability to attract customers for our products and services could
be adversely affected. Growth in residential solar energy also depends on dynamic macroeconomic conditions, retail prices of electricity
and customer preferences. Declining macroeconomic conditions, including labor markets and residential real estate markets, could contribute
to instability and uncertainty among customers and impact their financial ability, credit scores or interest in entering into long-term
contracts, even if such contracts would generate immediate and long-term savings. 

Market prices of retail electricity
generated by utilities or other energy sources also could decline for a variety of reasons, as discussed further below. Any such declines
in macroeconomic conditions, changes in retail prices of electricity or changes in customer preferences would adversely impact our business. 

We have historically benefited
from declining costs in our industry, and our business and financial results might be harmed not only as a result of any increases in
costs associated with our solar service offerings, but, also, by any failure of these costs to continue to decline as we currently expect.
If we do not reduce our cost structure in the future, we may not achieve profitability. 

Declining costs related to
raw materials, manufacturing and the sale and installation of our solar service offerings have been a key driver in the pricing of our
solar service offerings and customer adoption of solar energy. The prices of solar modules and raw materials have declined, however the
cost of solar modules and raw materials could increase in the future, and such products availability could decrease, due to a variety
of factors, including restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations, regulatory or
contractual limitations, industry market requirements, and changes in technology and industry standards. 

Other factors may also impact
costs, such as our choice to make significant investments to drive growth in the future. 

51 

Competition and Price Cutting 

The roofing industry is very
competitive based on the large number of contractors, and there is intense competition over the pricing of roof repairs and installations,
and our business might suffer if our competitors reduce their prices to where we can no longer profitably operate. 

We might lose business
to competitors that underbid us and might be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry. 

Most
of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor, and we compete against
multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than we and are vertically integrated,
and competitors larger than us may be able to better exploit economies of scale to receive higher discounts or rebates when purchasing
materials. An increase in competition may result in decreases in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins, and a downturn
in private residential and commercial construction could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations
or liquidity. 

Our business is
seasonal and subject to adverse weather conditions, which can adversely impact our business. 

Some
of our construction operations occur outdoors in areas in which hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, and/or wild fires are common.
Seasonal changes and adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather, can adversely affect our business operations
through delays in our construction schedules, and reduced efficiencies in our contracting operations, resulting in under-utilization of
crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Climate change may lead to increased extreme weather and changes in precipitation
and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy periods of time,
our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected. 

The reduction, modification, delay or discontinuation
of government subsidies and other economic incentives for the solar industry might reduce the profitability or viability of our solar
projects and materially adversely affect our business. 

Solar energy is not currently
cost competitive with other energy sources in our existing markets and the new markets into which we plan to expand. For a variety of
technological and economic reasons, the cost of generating electricity from solar energy in these markets currently exceeds and, absent
significant changes in technological or economic circumstances, will continue to exceed the cost of generating electricity from conventional
and certain other competing energy sources. Government subsidies and incentives, primarily in the form of tax credits, net metering, and
other incentives to end users and distributors of solar products are generally required to enable companies such as us to successfully
operate in these markets. 

Government subsidies and incentives
vary by geographic market. The availability and size of such subsidies and incentives depend, to a large extent, on political and policy
developments relating to environmental concerns, and other macro-economic factors. These government subsidies and incentives are expected
to gradually decrease in scope or be discontinued as solar energy technology improves and becomes more affordable relative to other types
of energy. Reductions have occurred in certain areas where we have operations, and subsidies and incentives may be further reduced or
discontinued in areas where we currently or intend to operate. A significant reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive
programs in our existing and target markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and prospects. 

52 

Existing rules, regulations and policies
pertaining to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation and changes to these regulations
and policies might deter the purchase and use of solar energy systems and negatively impact development of the solar energy industry. 

The market for solar energy
systems is heavily influenced by foreign, federal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility
industry, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical
interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. For example, the vast majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net
energy metering, or net metering , which allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility
grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility s retail rate for energy generated
by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid and not consumed on-site. The customer consequently pays for the net energy
used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more electricity is produced than consumed. Net metering, in some states, is being replaced
with lower credits for the excess electricity sent onto the grid from solar energy systems, and utilities are imposing minimum or fixed
monthly charges on owners of solar energy systems. These regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified in
the future in ways that can restrict the interconnection of solar energy systems and deter purchases of solar energy systems by customers.
Electricity generated by solar energy systems also competes most favorably in markets with tiered rate structures or peak hour pricing
that increase the price of electricity when more is consumed. Modifications to these rate structures by utilities, such as reducing peak
hour or tiered pricing or adopting flat rate pricing, could require the price of solar energy systems to be reduced in order to compete
with the price of utility generated electricity. 

Large California utilities
have, for instance, started transitioning customers to time-of-use rates and also have adopted a shift in the peak period for time-of-use
rates to later in the day. Unless grandfathered under a different rate, residential customers with solar energy systems are required to
take service under time-of-use rates with the later peak period. Moving utility customers to time-of-use rates or the shift in the timing
of peak rates for utility-generated electricity to include times of day when solar energy generation is less efficient or non-operable
could also make our offerings less competitive. Time-of-use rates could also result in higher costs for our customers whose electricity
requirements are not fully met by our offerings during peak periods. The price of electricity from utilities also may grow less quickly
than the escalator feature in certain of our solar service agreements, which could also make our systems less competitive with the price
of electricity from the electrical grid and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

An increase in our cost of materials could
arise as a result of US trade restrictions or tariffs on imported solar modules, cells, inverters, batteries or other products related
to our business. 

The US and China in 2018 began
a new round of mutual tariffs on various products imported from each other s country. The initial US tariffs on products from China
include an additional 25 tariff on solar modules and cells made in China, as well as a 25 tariff on inverters, batteries and electrical
equipment made in China beginning in January 2019. The US has also imposed or announced tariffs on products imported from other countries
that might provide products that we use. President Biden announced in a May 10, 2022 speech that he would consider ending tariffs on certain
goods produced in China to help reduce the prices of domestic goods, and his US Trade Representative earlier that month initiated a procedural
review of US tariffs on goods made in China leading up to the four-year anniversary of the Trump Administration s passage of July
and August 2018 tariffs on certain goods made in China. We cannot predict future tariffs or trade laws between the US and other countries,
which products might be subject to tariffs or other actions, or retaliatory actions against the US by such other countries. The adoption
and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements
or policies has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain, our costs, our suppliers, and the US economy, which could in turn
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

53 

For example, in January 2018,
in response to a petition filed under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, President Trump imposed four-year tariffs on imported solar
modules and imported solar cells not assembled into other products (the Section 201 Module Tariffs that apply to all imports
above a 2.5 gigawatts (GW) annual threshold. The Section 201 Module Tariffs were 30 in 2018 and stepped down by 5 annually in the second,
third and fourth years. In October 2020, President Trump issued a proclamation increasing the tariff from 15 to 18 for 2021, the final
year under the original Sec. 201 proclamation imposing the tariffs. 

The Peterson Institute for
International Economics or PIIE reported in April 2022 that Chinese exports to the U.S. currently incur an average 19.3 tariff, which
amount is more than 600 of the prevailing domestic tariff before trade tensions escalated, and much higher than the current 3.0 average
U.S. tariff on products originating in other countries. The PIIE report also indicated that on February 7, 2022, the U.S. reduced its
Section 201 tariffs on solar panels among other products, which indicates a potential easing of U.S.-China trade tariffs under the current
administration. 

Our business prospects could be harmed if
solar energy is not widely adopted or sufficient demand for solar energy systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate. 

The solar energy market is
at a relatively early stage of development. The extent to which solar energy will be widely adopted and the extent to which demand for
solar energy systems will increase are uncertain. If solar energy does not achieve widespread adoption or demand for solar energy systems
fails to develop sufficiently, we might be unable to achieve our revenue and profit targets. Demand for solar energy systems in our targeted
markets might not develop as we anticipate. Many factors may affect the demand for solar energy systems, including the following: 

availability of government and utility company subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar energy industry; 

government and utility policies regarding the interconnection of solar energy systems to the utility grid; 

fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as changes in the price of natural gas and other fossil fuels; 

cost-effectiveness (including the cost of solar modules), performance and reliability of solar energy systems compared with conventional and other non-solar renewable energy sources and products; 

success of other renewable energy generation technologies, such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, solar thermal, concentrated solar and biomass; 

availability of customer financing with economically attractive terms; 

fluctuations in expenditures by purchasers of solar energy systems, which tend to decrease in slower economic environments and periods of rising interest rates and tighter credit; and 

deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry. 

54 

Our business has benefited from the declining
cost of solar energy system components, and might be harmed to the extent that declines in the cost of such components stabilize or that
such costs increase in the future. 

Our business has benefited
from the declining cost of solar energy system components and to the extent such costs stabilize or decline at a slower rate, or, in fact,
increase, our future growth rate may be negatively impacted. The declining cost of solar energy system components and the raw materials
necessary to manufacture them has been a key driver in the price of solar energy systems we own, the prices charged for electricity and
customer adoption of solar energy. Solar energy system component and raw material prices might not continue to decline at the same rate
as they have over the past several years or at all, and growth in the solar industry and the resulting increase in demand for solar energy
system components and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them might also put upward pressure on prices. An increase of solar energy
system components and raw materials prices could slow our growth and cause our business and results of operations to suffer, and the cost
of solar energy system components and raw materials has and could continue to increase due to scarcity of materials, tariff penalties,
duties, the loss of or changes in economic governmental incentives or other factors. 

Although
average selling prices of solar modules in many global markets have declined for several years, recent spot pricing for solar modules
has increased, in part, due to elevated commodity and freight costs 

While
average selling prices of solar modules in many global markets have declined for several years, recent spot pricing for solar modules
has increased, in part, due to elevated commodity and freight costs. The price of polysilicon has significantly increased in recent months
due to a coal shortage in China, which resulted in higher energy prices and the Chinese government s mandating power restrictions
that led to curtailments of silicon metal production. Given that the majority of global polysilicon capacity is located in China, such
higher energy prices and reduced operating capacities have adversely affected the supply of polysilicon, contributing to an increase in
polysilicon pricing. In response to such supply shortage, certain other Chinese-based producers of polysilicon are in the process of expanding
their production capacity, which is expected to reduce the price of polysilicon in future periods. While the duration of this elevated
period of spot pricing is uncertain, module average selling prices in global markets are expected to decline in the long-term, and we
believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules, particularly those in China, have significant installed production capacity, relative
to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry might experience periods of structural
imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that excess capacity will put pressure
on pricing, and intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby potentially
increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and module manufacturers to sustain meaningful
and consistent profitability. We consequently continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced
module technology, our manufacturing process, our research and development capabilities, and the sustainability advantage of our modules. 

Shortages in the supply of silicon could
adversely affect the availability and cost of the solar photovoltaic modules used in our solar energy systems. 

Shortages of silicon or supply
chain issues could adversely affect the availability and cost of our solar energy systems. Manufacturers of photovoltaic modules depend
upon the availability and pricing of silicon, one of the primary materials used in photovoltaic modules. The worldwide market for silicon
from time to time experiences a shortage of supply, which can cause the prices for photovoltaic modules to increase and supplies of photovoltaic
modules become difficult to obtain. While we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of solar photovoltaic modules to satisfy our
needs to date, this may not be the case in the future. Future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could
result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins. Other international trade conditions such as
work slowdowns and labor strikes at port facilities or major weather events can also adversely impact the availability and price of solar
photovoltaic modules. 

55 

Due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic the solar industry is experiencing supply constraints, which are resulting in an increase in the cost of solar modules and inverters.
If the supply constraints and price increases continue our solar business might be affected. 

The primary driver of current
supply constraints in the solar industry is material shortages. In 2020, the solar industry experienced record growth in the United States,
despite the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 2019, and installations increased by 43 percent, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association
(SEIA). This record demand, coupled with decreased supply, has impacted many key materials throughout the solar supply chain, including
polysilicon, solar glass, and semiconductor chips. Polycrystalline silicon, commonly referred to as polysilicon, is a key raw material
used in many solar cells, which are responsible for capturing the energy from the sun and turning it into electricity in solar energy
systems. Polysilicon is largely produced in China, but factory shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the price of the raw
material to spike. Solar modules also include glass casing at the front of the module, which protects the solar cells, there has been
recent growing demand for bifacial solar modules, which produce energy from both sides of the module, requiring glass on both sides of
the solar module, as opposed to just on the front. In 2018, China, the largest producer of solar glass, imposed restrictions on glass
production due to concerns about the required energy consumption. With increasing demand for solar modules, and for solar glass specifically,
the restricted production of glass has been unable to meet the demand, causing the cost of solar glass to soar. In December 2020, China s
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) indicated that it would ease restrictions on the production of solar glass. While
solar glass supply is expected to remain constrained short-term, increased capacity due to these eased restrictions should expand supply
later this year and reduce prices. Semiconductor chips are a key component of inverters, which convert the direct current (DC) energy
produced by solar modules into usable alternating current (AC) energy. Inverters are also used for battery storage systems to convert
storable DC energy to usable AC energy and vice versa. The use of semiconductor chips is not isolated to the solar industry; they are
also crucial components of many other technologies, including cars, computers, and smartphones. Due to COVID-19 related factory shutdowns,
manufacturing of semiconductor chips decreased in early 2020, and as factories began to reopen, demand for products containing semiconductor
chips surged. The shortages of these materials and attendant price increases may affect our distribution of solar products and our installation
of solar energy systems, and future increases in the price of silicon or other materials and components could result in an increase in
costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global spending
on goods significantly increased global shipping resulting in increased costs and delays. Our company depends on international shipping
to obtain our solar products used in our distribution and installation businesses, and if such shipping constraints and price increases
continue, our solar business might be affected. 

The solar industry has also
faced constraints related to shipping. Pandemic-related spending on goods increased global shipping, leading to shortages in containers
and port congestion in the United States, impacting virtually every sector, including the solar industry. National lockdowns restricted
both manufacturing and shipping as the pandemic began, and many shipping containers, such as those used to hold goods such as solar modules,
became stranded and started to accumulate in the United States. Lockdowns continued in the United States as restrictions in China eased,
and containers could not be returned to China, which caused a container shortage in China where containers were needed to continue exporting
goods. Production of containers also decreased in 2020, further contributing to the shortage and causing prices of shipping containers
to escalate. Increased imports, resulting from pandemic spending, has also increased port congestion in the United States, which congestion
is exacerbated by significant recent increases in the size of container ships leading to longer unloading times, since each ship can now
carry tens of thousands of shipping containers. If the shipping constraints and the increases in shipping costs continue for a long period
of time our solar business might be affected. Future delays in shipping and increases in shipping costs or other materials could result
in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins. 

A May 2022 IHS Markit article
noted that COVID-19 related supply chain challenges and issues in shipping products from China to the U.S. have continued due to sustained
congestion and other delays at both U.S and Chinese ports, as well as an insufficient number of shipping containers. The shipping challenges
have also contributed to higher container shipping rates between China and the U.S., and the article reports that the rate in May 2022
of a typical 40-foot container from China to the U.S. West Coast was 14,226, several thousand dollars more than the comparable rate from
China to ports in Northern Europe. The article also noted that in increasing number of ships which are operating at only partial capacity
is magnifying the port congestion and delays in unloading cargo.

Due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic the roofing industry is experiencing supply constraints, which are resulting in scarcity and an increase in the cost of lumber.
If the supply constraints and price increases of lumber continue our roofing business may be affected. 

Significant supply constraints and price increases in the lumber SJ
America uses in its roofing business have occurred due to COVID-19 driven layoffs and plant closings. Lumber prices have been highly volatile
since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following supply chain disruptions. In the event our ability to source lumber continues
to be restricted or the prices of lumber continue to increase, the roofing business of SJ America may be affected. We hope these supply
issues are only short term, but there can be no assurance as to the timing when these supply constraints will end. Future increases in
the price of lumber or scarcity of lumber could result in an increase in costs to us, price increases to our customers or reduced margins. 

Our solar business installs solar energy systems, and many factors
can prevent us from completing installations on time or on budget. 

Factors that might prevent
us from completing installations on time or on budget include: 

shortages of materials; 

shortages of skilled labor; 

unforeseen installation scheduling, engineering, excavation, environmental or geological problems; 

job site issues that were not apparent during site inspection; 

natural disasters, hurricanes, weather interference, fires, earthquakes or other casualty losses or delays; 

delays in obtaining or inability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses or permits; 

changes to plans or specifications; 

performance by subcontractors; 

disputes with subcontractors; and 

unanticipated cost increases in materials, labor or other elements of our projects beyond budgets and allowances for contingencies. 

Our installation projects
expose us to risks of cost overruns due to typical uncertainties associated with any project or changes in the designs, plans or concepts
of such projects, and installation costs might exceed estimated costs of completion. 

57 

A material reduction in the retail price
of electricity charged by electric utilities or other retail electricity providers would harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

Decreases in the retail price
of electricity from electric utilities or from other retail electric providers, including other renewable energy sources such as larger-scale
solar energy systems, could make our offerings less economically attractive. The price of electricity from utilities could decrease as
a result of: 

the construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, whether generated by natural gas, nuclear power, coal, or renewable energy technologies; 

the construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines; 

a reduction in the price of natural gas or other natural resources as a result of increased supply due to new drilling techniques or other technological developments, relaxation of associated regulatory standards, or broader economic or policy developments; 

less demand for electricity due to energy conservation technologies and public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption or to recessionary economic conditions; and 

development of competing energy technologies that provide less expensive energy. 

A reduction in electric utilities 
rates or changes to peak hour pricing policies or rate design (such as the adoption of a fixed or flat rate) could also make our offerings
less competitive with the price of electricity from the electrical grid. If the cost of energy available from electric utilities or other
providers were to decrease relative to solar energy generated from residential systems or if similar events impacting the economics of
our offerings were to occur, we might have difficulty attracting new customers or existing customers might default or seek to terminate,
cancel or otherwise avoid the obligations under their solar service agreements. 

Our ability to provide our solar product
and service offerings to homeowners in the US on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to arrange financing for
these systems. Failure to find partners to provide such financing to our consumers would pose a significant obstacle for us to sustain
the US consumer business. 

We currently have only indirect
partnership relationships with consumer financing providers, through a third-party platform. We are in the process of establishing direct
relationships with several financing providers; however, we can give no assurance whether or when we can establish such relationships.
Historically, there have been a limited number of investors that generate sufficient profits and possess the requisite financial sophistication
to provide financing for solar energy systems for homeowners, and a lack of depth in this market might limit our ability to find partners
which can provide financing for our consumers. Our larger competitors might be able far more readily than we to offer financing options
to customers, including PPAs, pursuant to which solar energy systems are installed at little cost to the consumer. 

Certain types of home solar
energy system financing also depend on the existing tax regulatory environment. We are uncertain whether this type of financing will continue
to be available to us, as the legal and regulatory landscape may shift in a manner that reduces or eliminates the attractiveness of such
financing opportunities. 

58 

Our continued success requires us to hire,
train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry. 

The
success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited
to, our executive officers and key management personnel. We also rely on engineers, project management personnel, and other employees
and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and expertise to perform their respective services at a
reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it might be difficult to attract
and retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and within the time frame demanded by our customers. We might not be able
to satisfy the demand for our services in certain regions because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel,
and we might find it difficult to replace personnel who hold credentials that might be required to perform certain government projects
and/or who have significant government contract experience. 

We
note that the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The uncertainty
of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts, and should an expected contract award
be delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to attract, train and retain
technical personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

Our
future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train and retain technical personnel. Recruiting and retaining
qualified technical personnel, particularly those with expertise in the solar power industry, is vital to our success. There is substantial
competition for qualified technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain sufficient qualified
technical personnel, and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business might be materially and adversely affected. 

Changes
in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners might make it difficult
to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work, and if we are unable to provide competitive
compensation packages, high-quality training programs and attractive work environments or to establish and maintain successful partnerships,
our reputation, relationships and/or ability to profitably execute our work could be adversely impacted. 

Failure to maintain safe work sites could
result in significant losses . 

Construction
and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces and often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment,
moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. We are often responsible for safety and must
implement safety procedures. Should our safety procedures prove ineffective or incomplete, we might suffer injury to our employees, and
expose the company to litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could result in reduced
profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations,
cash flows and liquidity. 

59 

Failure of our subcontractors to perform
as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results. 

We subcontract portions of
some of our contracts to specialty subcontractors, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although
we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees, we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our
higher-risk subcontractors. We might be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated,
resulting in a potentially adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity, and the total costs of a project could exceed our original
estimates and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, which could have an adverse impact on our financial
position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 

Compliance with occupational safety and
health requirements and best practices can be costly, and noncompliance with such requirements might result in potentially significant
monetary penalties, operational delays and adverse publicity. 

The installation and ongoing
operations and maintenance of roofing products or roof-top solar energy systems requires individuals hired by us or third-party contractors,
including our employees, to work at heights with complicated and potentially dangerous electrical systems. 

The evaluation and modification
of buildings as part of the installation process requires these individuals to work in locations that may contain potentially dangerous
levels of asbestos, lead, mold or other materials known or believed to be hazardous to human health. There is substantial risk of serious
injury or death if proper safety procedures are not followed. Our operations are subject to regulation OSHA and equivalent state and local
laws, and changes to OSHA requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased
costs. If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we might be subject to civil
or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures or suspend or limit operations.
Because individuals hired by us or on our behalf to perform installation and ongoing operations and maintenance of our solar energy systems
and energy storage systems, including our dealers and third-party contractors, are compensated on a per project basis, they are incentivized
to work more quickly than installers that are compensated on an hourly basis. While we have not experienced a high level of injuries to
date, this incentive structure may result in higher injury rates than others in the industry and could accordingly expose us to increased
liability. Individuals hired by or on behalf of us may have workplace accidents and receive citations from OSHA regulators for alleged
safety violations, resulting in fines. Any such accidents, citations, violations, injuries or failure to comply with industry best practices
may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect our business. A failure to comply
with laws and regulations relating to interactions by us or our dealers with current or prospective residential customers could result
in negative publicity, claims, investigations and litigation, and adversely affect our financial performance. 

Our business substantially
focuses on transactions with residential customers. We must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern
matters relating to interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to consumer protection, marketing and sales, privacy
and data security, consumer financial and credit transactions, mortgages and refinancing, home improvement contracts, warranties and various
means of customer solicitation. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various
federal, state and local legislative and regulatory bodies may initiate investigations, expand current laws or regulations, or enact new
laws and regulations, regarding these matters. Changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation could dramatically affect
how we and our dealers do business, acquire customers, and manage and use information collected from and about current and prospective
customers and the costs associated therewith. 

We strive to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations relating to interactions with residential customers. It is possible, however, that these requirements
might be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or
our customary practices. 

60 

Damage to our brands and reputation, or
change or loss of use of our brands, could harm our business and results of operations. 

We depend significantly on
our reputation for high-quality products, excellent customer service and the brand names Solar Juice, Opal, 
 Solar4America, and Roofs 4 America to attract new customers and grow our business. If SJ Australia fails to
continue to deliver solar and other energy components timely, or if SJ America damages any of our customers properties or delays
or cancels projects, our brand and reputation could be significantly impaired. Future technological improvements might allow us to offer
lower prices or offer new technology to new customers; however, technical limitations in our current solar energy systems and energy storage
systems might prevent us from offering such lower prices or new technology to our existing customers. The inability of our current customers
to benefit from technological improvements could cause our existing customers to lower the value they perceive our existing products offer
and impair our brand and reputation. 

We note that given the sheer
number of interactions our consumer business has with customers and potential customers, it is inevitable that some customer interactions
with our company or dealers operating on our behalf will be perceived as less than satisfactory. These could lead to instances of customer
complaints which could affect our ratings on websites and social media platforms, and if we cannot manage our hiring and training processes
to avoid or minimize these issues to the extent possible, our reputation might be harmed and our ability to attract new customers would
suffer. 

We face competition from traditional energy
companies as well as solar and other renewable energy companies. 

The solar energy industry
is highly competitive and continually evolving, as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with
large utilities. We believe that our competitors include established utilities that supply energy to homeowners by traditional means,
and we compete with these utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price, and the ease by which homeowners can switch to
electricity generated by our solar service offerings. If we cannot offer compelling value to customers based on these factors, then our
business and revenue will not grow. We also compete with traditional installers who face similar challenges. 

The production of solar energy
depends heavily on suitable meteorological and environmental conditions. If meteorological or environmental conditions are unexpectedly
unfavorable, the electricity production from our solar service offerings might be below our customers expectations, reducing the
attractiveness of our offerings compared with traditional energy suppliers. 

We also face competition
from other residential solar service providers. Many of these competitors have a higher degree of brand name recognition, differing business
and pricing strategies, and greater capital resources than we have, as well as extensive knowledge of our target markets. If we are unable
to establish or maintain a consumer brand that resonates with customers, maintain high customer satisfaction, or compete with the pricing
offered by our competitors, our sales and market share position might be adversely affected, as our growth is dependent on originating
new customers. We also face competitive pressure from companies that might offer lower-priced consumer offerings than we do. 

We compete with companies
that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution
infrastructure. These power service companies are able to offer customers electricity supply-only solutions that are competitive with
our solar service offerings on both price and usage of solar energy technology, which might limit our ability to attract customers, particularly
those who wish to avoid long-term contracts or have an aesthetic or other objection to putting solar modules on their roofs. 

61 

We also face competition from
purely finance-driven nonintegrated competitors that subcontract out the installation of solar energy systems, from installation businesses
(including solar partners) that seek financing from external parties, from large construction companies, and from electrical and other
roofing companies. Local installers that might otherwise be viewed as potential solar partners might gain market share by being able to
be the first providers in new local markets, and some of these competitors might provide energy at lower costs than we do. We also face
competition from companies offering consumer loans for solar module products, since declining prices for solar modules and related equipment
has resulted in an increase in consumers purchasing, instead of leasing, solar energy systems. 

As the solar industry grows
and evolves, we will continue to face existing competitors as well as new competitors who are not currently in the market (including those
resulting from the consolidation of existing competitors) that achieve significant developments in alternative technologies or new products
such as storage solutions, loan products, or other programs related to third-party ownership. Our failure to adapt to changing market
conditions, to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and to adopt new or enhanced technologies could limit our growth
and have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 

Changes to net metering and related policies
might significantly reduce demand for electricity from our solar service offerings. 

A substantial majority of
states have adopted net metering policies, which are designed to allow homeowners to serve their own energy loads using on-site generation.
Electricity that is generated by a solar energy system and consumed on-site avoids a retail energy purchase from the applicable utility,
and excess electricity that is exported back to the electric grid generates a retail credit within a homeowner s monthly billing
period. At the end of the monthly billing period, if the homeowner has generated excess electricity within that month, the homeowner typically
carries forward a credit for any excess electricity to be offset against future utility energy purchases. At the end of an annual billing
period or calendar year, utilities either continue to carry forward a credit, or reconcile the homeowner s final annual or calendar
year bill using different rates (including zero credit) for the exported electricity. 

Utilities, their trade
associations, and fossil fuel interests in the country are currently challenging net metering policies, and seeking to eliminate them,
cap them, reduce the value of the credit provided to homeowners for excess generation, or impose charges on homeowners that have net metering. 

California s Public
Utilities Commission CPUC has made changes to rate design for solar customers, such as adopting time of use 
rates with different electricity prices during peak and off peak hours, as well as modifications to the minimum bill for solar customers.
The CPUC is revisiting its net metering policy in a proceeding that began in the third quarter of 2020 and is expected to conclude near
the end of 2021 and not take effect until sometime in 2022. The California investor-owned utilities, along with other parties, are seeking
to reduce the level of compensation for customer-owned generation and to impose grid access fees on solar customers. Similarly, certain
California municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the CPUC and would not be governed by the CPUC's net metering policy, have
also announced they plan to review their net metering policies. 

62 

Electric utility statutes and regulations
and changes to such statutes or regulations might present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of our solar
service offerings that may significantly reduce demand for such offerings. 

Federal, state and local government
statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our solar service offerings and are constantly evolving.
These statutes, regulations, and administrative rulings relate to electricity pricing, net metering, consumer protection, incentives,
taxation, competition with utilities, and the interconnection of homeowner-owned and third party-owned solar energy systems to the electrical
grid. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for residential
customers on a regular basis and these changes can have a negative impact on our ability to deliver savings, or energy bill management,
to customers. 

Many utilities, their trade
associations, and fossil fuel interests, which have significantly greater economic, technical, operational, and political resources than
the residential solar industry, are currently challenging solar-related policies to reduce the competitiveness of residential solar energy.
Any adverse changes in solar-related policies could have a negative impact on our business and prospects. 

Regulations and policies related to rate
design could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar service offerings, reduce the value of the electricity our systems produce,
and reduce any savings that our customers could realize from our solar service offerings. 

All states regulate investor-owned
utility retail electricity pricing, and there are numerous publicly owned utilities and electric cooperatives that establish their own
retail electricity pricing through some form of regulation or internal process. These regulations and policies could deter potential customers
from purchasing our solar service offerings. California, our primary state of operations, has one of the most aggressive rate design pricing
regimes, which includes high electricity rates and incentives for consumers to transition to solar energy and other types of renewable
energy. Texas is another state in which we operate, and in contrast has electricity pricing which is much lower than the national average,
as its policy emphasizes cheaper power rather than green energy incentives. Nevada is a third state in which we operate, and has an electricity
rate regime more similar to that of Texas than California. Utilities in still other states such as Arizona and Utah have sought and secured
rate design changes that reduce credit for residential solar exports to below the retail rate and impose new charges for rooftop solar
customers, and other state utilities might follow suit. Such rate changes can include changing rates to charge lower volume-based
rates the rates charged for kilowatt hours of electricity purchased by a residential customer while raising unavoidable fixed
charges that homeowners are subject to when they purchase solar energy from third parties and levying charges on homeowners based on their
point of maximum demand during a month (referred to as demand charge ). Such forms of rate design could adversely impact
our business by reducing the value of the electricity our solar energy systems produce compared to retail net metering, and reducing any
savings customers realize by purchasing our solar service offerings. In addition to changes in general electricity rates charged to all
residential customers, utilities are increasingly seeking solar-specific charges (which may be fixed charges, capacity-based charges,
or other rate charges). Any of these changes could materially reduce the demand for our offerings and could limit the number of markets
in which our offerings are competitive with electricity provided by the utilities. 

Interconnection limits or circuit-level
caps imposed by regulators might significantly reduce our ability to sell our solar service offerings in certain markets or slow interconnections. 

Interconnection rules establish
the circumstances in which rooftop solar will be connected to the electricity grid, and interconnection limits or circuit-level caps imposed
by regulators may curb our growth in key markets. Utilities throughout the country have different rules and regulations regarding interconnection
and some utilities cap or limit the amount of solar energy that can be interconnected to the grid. Our systems do not provide power to
customers until they are interconnected to the grid. 

63 

Interconnection regulations
are based on claims from utilities regarding the amount of solar energy that can be connected to the grid without causing grid reliability
issues or requiring significant grid upgrades. Some states require the activation of some advanced inverter functionality to head off
presumed grid reliability issues, which might require more expensive equipment and more oversight of the operation of the solar energy
systems over time. Such regulations might hamper our ability to sell our offerings in certain markets and increase our costs, adversely
affecting our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. These advanced functions will become more commonplace as
regions start to require 1547-2018 inverters, with activation of some advanced functions starting January 2022 in Colorado and elsewhere. 

We might not be able to obtain sufficient
raw materials in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition. 

Although the global supply
of polysilicon has increased significantly, we might experience interruption to our supply of silicon or other raw materials or late delivery
in the future for the following reasons, among others: 

suppliers under our raw materials supply contracts might delay deliveries for a significant period of time without incurring penalties; 

our virgin polysilicon suppliers might not be able to meet our production needs consistently or on a timely basis; 

compared with us, some of our competitors who also purchase virgin polysilicon from our suppliers have longer and stronger relationships with and have greater buying power and bargaining leverage over some of our key suppliers; and 

our supply of silicon or other raw materials is subject to the business risk of our suppliers, some of whom have limited operating history and limited financial resources, any one or more of which could go out of business for reasons beyond our control. 

Our failure to obtain the
required amounts of silicon raw materials and other raw materials, such as glass, in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms
could increase our manufacturing costs and substantially limit our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers. Any failure
by us to meet such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, ability to retain customers, market share, business
and results of operations and may subject us to claims from our customers and other disputes. Our failure to obtain sufficient silicon
and other raw materials would result in under-utilization of our production facilities and an increase in our marginal production costs,
and any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on our growth, profitability and results of operations. 

Failure to achieve satisfactory production
volumes of our solar module products could result in higher unit production costs. 

The production of solar modules
involves complex processes. Deviations in the manufacturing process can cause a substantial decrease in output and, in some cases, disrupt
production significantly or result in no output. From time to time, we have experienced lower-than-anticipated manufacturing output during
the ramp-up of production lines, which can occur during the introduction of new products, the installation of new equipment or the implementation
of new process technologies. As we bring additional lines or facilities into production, we might operate at less than intended capacity
during the ramp-up period, and the demand in global solar power product markets might decrease, including the demand for solar modules,
which could cause us to operate at less than intended capacity, and result in higher marginal production costs and lower output, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

64 

Performance shortcomings in our products
might cause us to incur additional expenses and warranty costs, damage our reputation and cause our sales to decline. 

Our products might contain
defects that are not detected until after they are shipped or inspected by our customers. 

Our solar modules are
typically sold with a 10-year warranty for material and workmanship and a 25-year (30-year for dual glass module) linear power output
warranty against the maximum degradation of the actual power output for each year after the warranty start date, and if a solar module
is defective during the relevant warranty period, we will either repair or replace the solar module. As we continue to increase our sales
to the major export markets, we might be exposed to increased warranty claims. Product defects could cause significant damage
to our market reputation and reduce our product sales and market share, and our failure to maintain the consistency and quality throughout
our production process could result in substandard quality or performance of our products. If we deliver our products with defects, or
if there is a perception that our products are of substandard quality, we might incur substantially increased costs associated with returns
or replacements of our products, our credibility and market reputation could be harmed and our sales and market share may be materially
adversely affected. 

Our lack of sufficient patent protection in and outside of US
might undermine our competitive position and subject us to intellectual property disputes with third parties, both of which might have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We have developed various
production process related know-how and technologies, which have a critical role in our quality assurance and cost reduction. We have
also implemented our research and development programs to develop techniques and processes that will improve production efficiency and
product quality. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights from our research and development programs will be crucial in maintaining
our competitive edge in the solar power industry. As of the date of this prospectus, we have two patents and two other pending patent
applications in the US Our patents validity is generally ten years, and we plan to sustain protection for our intellectual property
and proprietary knowledge with patents and otherwise, but cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining patents in the US
in a timely manner or at all. We also use contractual arrangements with employees and trade secret protections to protect our intellectual
property and proprietary rights, but contractual arrangements afford only limited protection and the actions we might take to protect
our intellectual property and proprietary rights might not be adequate. Other parties might obtain knowledge of our know-how and technologies
through independent development, and our inability to protect our production process, related know-how and technologies, our intellectual
property and proprietary rights or any combination of the above might undermine our competitive position. Third parties may infringe
upon or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Policing unauthorized use
of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive, and litigation can be costly and diverts management attention and other resources
away from our business, but might be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the
validity and scope of our proprietary rights. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in any potential litigation, and an adverse determination
might impair our intellectual property and proprietary rights and harm our business, prospects and reputation. 

Risks Related to Our Operation in Phoenix 

The Company s investment
in Phoenix Cars LLC and Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC (together, Phoenix is highly risky. Following are material risks
related to the investment. 

Our results of Phoenix operations have not
resulted in profitability, and may not be able to achieve profitability going forward. 

Phoenix had accumulated deficit
of 28.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Phoenix have incurred a net loss of 12.7 million and 14.6 million, for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Phoenix may incur significant losses in the future and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties,
complications, delays and other unknown events. Its management is developing plans to alleviate the negative trends and conditions described
above and there is no guarantee that such plans will be successfully implemented. Its business plan is focused on providing sustainable
and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector but is still unproven. There is no assurance that even if we successfully
implement our business plan, that Phoenix will be able to curtail its losses or ever achieve profitable operations. 

Phoenix has yet to achieve positive cash
flow and, given its projected funding needs, its ability to generate positive cash flow is uncertain. 

Phoenix has had negative cash
flow from operating activities of 14.9 million and 12.9 million for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Phoenix anticipate that it
will continue to have negative cash flow from operating and investing activities through the remainder of 2023 as it expects to incur
research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses and make capital expenditures in its efforts to
increase sales and ramp up operations. Its business also will at times require significant amounts of working capital to support its growth.
An inability to generate positive cash flow for the near term may adversely affect its ability to raise needed capital for its business
on reasonable terms, diminish supplier or customer willingness to enter into transactions with Phoenix, and have other adverse effects
that may decrease its long-term viability. There can be no assurance that Phoenix will achieve positive cash flow in the near future or
at all. 

65 

Phoenix may need to raise additional financing
for the remainder of 2023, and such financing may not be available to Phoenix on acceptable terms or at all. 

Although we believe Phoenix
has sufficient capital resources and capital availability to meet its needs for the remainder of 2023, we expect that phoenix will not
be able to maintain the levels of capital and operating expenditures necessary to perform its current business plan, including launch
and ramp of its Gen 4 products unless Phoenix generates additional cash from operations or obtain additional financing. In light of its
operating history and the expected schedule to bring Gen 4 to market, we expect that it will be necessary to obtain additional financing,
either through the existing SEPA equity line to issue registered shares, private placement of un-registered shares, or debt financing.
We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to Phoenix on favorable terms when required, or at all. Recent turmoil
in the capital markets, including the tightening of credit and rise of interest rates, may cause Phoenix to face higher borrowing costs,
less available capital, more stringent terms and tighter covenants. In such circumstances, if Phoenix cannot raise additional capital,
its financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if Phoenix
raises additional capital through issuances of equity, through the SEPA or otherwise, Phoenix s stockholders could experience dilution. 

The automotive market is highly competitive,
and Phoenix may not be successful in competing in this industry. 

Both the automobile industry
generally, and the EV segment in particular, are highly competitive, and Phoenix will be competing for customers and sales with both EV
manufacturers and traditional automotive companies. Most of its current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial,
technical, manufacturing, marketing, or other resources than Phoenix does and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development,
manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products than Phoenix may devote to its products. Phoenix expects competition
for EVs to intensify due to increased demand and a regulatory push for alternative fuel vehicles. In addition, as fleet operators begin
transitioning to EVs on a mass scale, Phoenix expects that more well-financed competitors will enter the commercial fleet EV market. Further,
as a result of new entrants in the commercial fleet EV market, Phoenix may experience increased competition for components and other parts
of its vehicles, which may have limited or single-source supply. 

If Phoenix is unable to successfully
design, develop, manufacture and sell its Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, its business, prospects, financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If Phoenix is able to manufacture and market the Gen 4, Gen
5, EF-1 truck and EF-1 V van, factors affecting competition include product performance and quality, technological innovation, customer
experience, brand differentiation, product design, pricing and TCO, and manufacturing scale and efficiency. Increased competition will
lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in downward price pressure and adversely affect its business,
prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

66 

Phoenix may face competition from global
automotive manufacturers. 

Phoenix competes with a number
of commercial EV manufacturers, including those such as Lightning eMotors, GreenPower Bus, SEA Electric and Arrival. In addition to Tesla
 Rivian, a number of traditional global automobile manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes Benz, and Nissan-Renault-
Mitsubishi-Toyota, have entered the consumer EV business, and a few, including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun
entry into the commercial EV market. These companies have far greater resources, brand recognition, and distribution channels than Phoenix
or the Company does, which could make it difficult for Phoenix to gain widespread market acceptance. There can be no assurance that Phoenix
will be able to compete successfully with other market participants, and, if Phoenix cannot, then its business could fail. 

Phoenix will continue to require additional
capital to fund its operations, and if Phoenix fails to obtain necessary financing, Phoenix may not be able to complete the development
and commercialization of its electric vehicles. 

The design, manufacture and
sale of electric vehicles is a capital-intensive business. Although Phoenix pursues an asset light strategy for growth,
its business plan to design, produce, sell and service commercial electric buses, vans and trucks, including the Gen 4, Gen 5, EF-1 truck
and EF-1 V van, is expected to require continued capital investment and incur substantial costs including research and development expenses,
raw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as Phoenix builds its brand and market its vehicles, and general and administrative
expenses as Phoenix scales its operations, identify and commit resources to investigate new areas of demand and incur costs as a public
company. its ability to become profitable in the future will not only depend on its ability to complete the design and development of
its vehicles but also to control its capital expenditures and costs. As Phoenix expands its product portfolio, including the scheduled
release of Gen 4 in 2023, Phoenix will need to manage costs effectively to sell those products at its expected margins. If Phoenix is
unable to cost efficiently design, manufacture, market, sell and distribute and service its vehicles and provide its services, its business,
prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. Unlike established EV
automotive manufacturers that have greater financial resources than Phoenix does, there can be no assurance that Phoenix will have access
to the capital Phoenix needs on favorable terms when required or at all. In addition, future debt financing into which Phoenix enters
may impose upon us covenants that restrict its operations, including limitations on its ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay
dividends, redeem its stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. 

If Phoenix is unable to raise
additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, Phoenix may be required to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the
development or commercialization of one or more of its EV products, restrict its operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements
on unattractive terms, which would likely have a material adverse effect on its business, stock price and its relationships with third
parties with whom Phoenix has business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained. If Phoenix does not have sufficient
funds to continue operations, Phoenix could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in
its stockholders losing some or all of their investment in us. In addition, its ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive
pressures would be significantly limited. 

Phoenix may experience delays in launching and ramping up production
or Phoenix may be unable to control its manufacturing costs. 

Phoenix has previously experienced
and may in the future experience launch and production ramp-up delays. In addition, Phoenix may introduce in the future new or unique
manufacturing processes and design features for its products including enhancements under development relating to production assembly
efficiency, material component availability, cost reduction and customer feedback. There is no guarantee Phoenix will be able to successfully
and timely introduce and scale such processes or features. Phoenix has limited experience to date in manufacturing electric vehicles at
low volumes. To be successful, Phoenix will need to implement, maintain, and ramp-up efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities,
processes and supply chains, high quality and output rates planned at its Anaheim manufacturing facility. Phoenix also needs to hire,
train, and compensate skilled employees for operations. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those experienced in the past
may arise during its production ramps, and Phoenix must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and
reducing costs. If Phoenix is not successful in achieving these goals, Phoenix could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining its
vehicle production ramp-ups or be unable to meet its related cost and profitability targets. Any delay or other complication in ramping
up the production of its current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp-ups of its future products, features
and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm its brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and
operating results. 

67 

Costs of electric vehicles are high in comparison
with those of traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines or hybrids. 

Phoenix s EVs will
not gain wide acceptance unless Phoenix can reduce manufacturing and selling costs. Prices of Phoenix EVs range from 165,000 to 225,000,
whereas prices of comparable traditional combustion engine vehicles range from approximately 50,000 to 80,000. The cost difference is
due to the incremental cost of electric drivetrain, including lithium-ion batteries, motors, inverter and control software, coupled with
the relatively low volume of production, leading to higher overheads. 

In addition, government subsidies
and incentives, including those available in California, are important for the cost-competitiveness of Phoenix s EVs, and Phoenix s
growth and prospects depend in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory
application of government subsidies and incentives because of budgetary challenges, policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies
and incentives due to the perceived success of electric vehicles, or other reasons may impair the cost-competitiveness of Phoenix s
EVs. 

The range of Phoenix s existing EVs is limited, compared
with that of traditional vehicles. 

Whereas traditional combustion
engine medium-duty vehicles may travel from 240 to 350 miles before refueling, Phoenix s existing EVs have a maximum range of 160
miles and minimum recharging time of five to six hours. Currently, Phoenix s EVs can be charged only at the owner s location
or select public charging locations using compatible charging equipment, further limiting the EVs to local use. Accordingly, potential
customers needing vehicles with longer ranges or quicker turnaround of depleted electric energy supply may find Phoenix s products
relatively less attractive. 

Phoenix may experience significant delays
in the design, manufacture, financing, regulatory approval, launch and delivery of its vehicles, which could harm its business, prospects,
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Phoenix s future business
depends in large part on its ability to execute on its plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell its vehicles. Any delay in the financing,
design, manufacture, regulatory approval, launch or delivery of its vehicles could materially damage its brand, business, prospects, financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could cause liquidity constraints. Vehicle manufacturers often experience delays
in the design, manufacture, and commercial release of new products. To the extent Phoenix delay the launch of its vehicles, its growth
prospects could be adversely affected as Phoenix may fail to establish or grow its market share. Furthermore, Phoenix relies on third-party
suppliers for the provision and development of the key components and materials used in its vehicles. To the extent its suppliers experience
any delays in providing us with or developing necessary components Phoenix could experience delays in delivering on its timelines. 

All of Phoenix s current range of
products are built on Ford s E-450 chassis. A decision by Ford to offer an electric version of this chassis, directly, would impact
the viability of Phoenix s current products. 

Phoenix currently builds
all its products on Ford s E-450 chassis. Ford does not offer an electric version of this chassis, due to the relatively small market
size for medium-duty electric vehicles. As volumes increase, there is a potential risk of Ford s launching an electric version of
Ford s E-450 chassis directly from the factory, negating the need for Phoenix s current range of products. Additionally, a
shortage in the availability of this chassis would impact Phoenix s capability to produce and fulfill customer s orders in
a timely manner. 

68 

Phoenix s future growth is dependent
upon the willingness of operators of commercial vehicle fleets to adopt electric vehicles and upon its ability to produce, sell and service
vehicles that meet their needs. If the market for commercial electric vehicles does not develop as Phoenix expects, or if it develops
slower than Phoenix expects, its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected. 

Phoenix s growth requires
adoption of commercial vehicle operators to adopt EVs for their fleets and on its ability to produce, sell and service vehicles that meet
their needs. EVs use in the medium-duty commercial vehicle market is a relatively new development, particularly in the United States,
and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving government regulation, industry standards, and customer views of the
merits of using electric vehicles in their businesses. This process has been slow, as, without including the impact of government or other
subsidies and incentives, the purchase prices for Phoenix s EVs currently is higher than those for diesel-fueled vehicles. The relatively
low price of oil has also hurt Phoenix s over the last few years. 

Phoenix must educate fleet
managers regarding the economic benefits that Phoenix believes result over the life of its EVs. Phoenix believes that these benefits depend
on the following: 

the difference in the initial purchase prices of commercial electric vehicles and vehicles with comparable
gross vehicle weight powered by internal combustion engines or hybrids, both including the effect of government and other subsidies and
incentives designed to promote the purchase of electric vehicles; 

the total cost of ownership of the vehicle over its expected life, which includes the initial purchase
price and ongoing operating and maintenance costs; 

the availability and terms of financing options for purchases of vehicles and, for commercial electric
vehicles, financing options for battery systems; 

the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles and
future regulations requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles; 

government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy; 

fuel prices, including volatility in the cost of diesel fuel; 

cost and availability of other alternatives to diesel fueled vehicles, such as vehicles powered by natural
gas or hybrids; 

corporate sustainability initiatives; 

commercial electric vehicle quality, performance and safety (particularly with respect to lithium-ion
battery packs); 

the quality and availability of service for the vehicle, including the availability of replacement parts; 

the range over which commercial electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge; 

access to charging stations and related infrastructure costs, and standardization of electric vehicle
charging systems; 

electric grid capacity and reliability; and 

macroeconomic factors. 

69 

If, in weighing these factors,
operators of commercial vehicle fleets determine that there is no compelling business justification for purchasing commercial EVs, the
market for commercial EVs may not develop as, or may develop more slowly than, Phoenix expects which would adversely affect Phoenix s
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

Phoenix has a limited number of customers,
with which Phoenix does not have long-term agreements, and expects that a significant portion of its future sales will be from a limited
number of customers. The loss of any of these customers could materially harm Phoenix s business. 

A significant portion of
Phoenix s projected future revenue is expected to be generated from a limited number of customers. Phoenix has no contracts with
customers that include long-term commitments that ensure future sales of vehicles. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated
sales to Phoenix s most significant customers would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition
and operating results. 

An inability to attract new customers for
its Gen 4 products and future generations of products will substantially impact its ability to grow revenue or improve its financial results. 

Phoenix s growth will
depend in large part on its ability to attract new customers. As Phoenix drives growth in its existing markets, and Phoenix anticipates
that its sales activities will lead to additional orders and deliveries for its Gen 4 products, and, as a result, increase its base of
customers. An inability to attract new customers would substantially impact its ability to grow revenue or improve its financial results.
Further, Phoenix often receive binding and non-binding purchase orders from customers that are contingent on various factors, such as
completing a successful pilot program, obtaining third-party financing or obtaining government grants, such as HVIP. In addition, some
customers are interested in future products, not yet in its production. While Phoenix continuously strives to expand its product portfolio,
developing new products takes a significant amount of time and expense, such as engineering work, sourcing new suppliers, marketing, testing
and quality control. In addition, orders may be delayed for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond its control, including supplier
delays, which may cause delays in its manufacturing process, or delays in customers obtaining financing. As a result, any such orders
may not result in actual revenue in the near term or at all. Accordingly, revenue estimates and the amount and timing of work expected
to be performed at the time the estimate of order backlog is developed is subject to change. 

Phoenix may not be able to accurately estimate
the supply and demand for its vehicles, which could result in a variety of inefficiencies in its business and hinder its ability to generate
revenue. If Phoenix fails to accurately predict its manufacturing requirements, Phoenix could incur additional costs or experience delays. 

It is difficult to predict
its future revenues and appropriately budget for its expenses, and Phoenix may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect
its business. Phoenix will be required to provide forecasts of its demand to its suppliers several months prior to the scheduled delivery
of products to its prospective customers. If Phoenix overestimates its requirements, its suppliers may have excess inventory, which indirectly
would increase its costs. If Phoenix underestimates its requirements, its suppliers may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt
manufacturing of its products and result in delays in shipments and revenues. In addition, lead times for materials and components that
its suppliers order may vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component
at a given time. If Phoenix fails to order sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, the delivery of vehicles to
its customers could be delayed, which would harm its business, financial condition and operating results. 

70 

Phoenix faces various challenges in scaling
manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes effectively and quickly from low volume production to high volume production for its
Gen 4 drivetrain products. 

Phoenix has no experience
to date in high volume manufacturing, assembling, and converting to commercial electric vehicles. Phoenix does not know whether Phoenix
will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component
supply that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes
Phoenix targets. Any failure to develop such manufacturing, assembly and converting processes and capabilities and reliable sources of
component supply within its projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, operating results
and financial condition. Even if Phoenix is successful in developing its high-volume manufacturing, assembly and converting capability
and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, Phoenix does not know whether Phoenix will be able to do so in a manner that
avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond its control such as problems with suppliers and vendors,
or in time to meet its commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. In addition, certain components Phoenix
integrates may not be available on a consistent basis or in large quantities. its business, prospects, financial condition and operating
results could be adversely affected if Phoenix experiences disruptions in its supply chain or if Phoenix cannot obtain materials of sufficient
quality at reasonable prices. 

The complexity in Phoenix s business
is expected to grow as Phoenix develop new products and services. Phoenix has limited experience in simultaneously designing, testing,
manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling its electric drivetrains as well as limited experience allocating its available resources
among the design and production of multiple electric drivetrains. As Phoenix add complexity to its product line and introduce new products
and services, Phoenix may experience unexpected delays. 

If Phoenix is unable to scale
its existing assembly processes and systems quickly while maintaining its current quality level, including as a result of supply chain
constraints and inability to manage complexity in its business, Phoenix may be unable to meet its customers vehicle quality and
quantity requirements or its forecasted production schedule or lower its cost of sales. As a result, Phoenix may not be able to meet its
customers delivery schedules and could face the loss of customers, or be exposed to liability to customers to which Phoenix promised
delivery, which could adversely affect its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

If Phoenix fails to scale
its business operations or otherwise manage future growth effectively as Phoenix attempts to rapidly grow its company, Phoenix may not
be able to produce, market, service and sell its vehicles profitably or successfully. 

Phoenix s future growth depends upon
its ability to maintain relationships with its existing suppliers and source suppliers for its critical components, and to complete building
out its supply chain, while effectively managing the risks due to such relationships. 

Phoenix s success will
be dependent upon its ability to maintain and expand its relationships with suppliers who are critical and necessary to the output and
production of its vehicles. Phoenix also relies on a small group of suppliers to provide us with the components for its vehicles. The
supply agreements Phoenix has or may enter into with key suppliers in the future may have provisions where such agreements can be terminated
in various circumstances, including potentially without cause. If these suppliers become unable to provide, or experience delays in providing,
components, or if the supply agreements Phoenix has in place are terminated, it may be difficult to find replacement components. Changes
in business conditions, pandemics, governmental changes and other factors beyond its control or that Phoenix does not presently anticipate
could affect its ability to receive components from its suppliers. 

71 

Further, Phoenix has not
secured supply agreements for all of its components. In addition, there is the possibility that finalizing the supply agreements for the
parts and components of its vehicles will cause significant disruption to its operations, or such supply agreements could be at costs
that make it difficult for us to operate profitably. 

If Phoenix does not enter
into long-term supply agreements with guaranteed pricing for its parts or components, Phoenix may be exposed to fluctuations in prices
of components, materials and equipment. Agreements for the purchase of battery cells typically contain pricing provisions that are subject
to adjustment based on changes in market prices of key commodities. Substantial increases in the prices for such components, materials
and equipment would increase its operating costs and could reduce its margins, if Phoenix cannot recoup the increased costs. Any attempts
to increase the announced or expected prices of its vehicles in response to increased costs could be viewed negatively by its potential
customers and could adversely affect its business, prospects, financial condition or operating results. 

Phoenix may be unable to adequately control
the costs or maintain adequate supply of components associated with its operations. 

Phoenix may be unable to
adequately control the costs associated with its operations. Phoenix expects to incur significant costs related to procuring raw materials
required to manufacture and assemble its vehicles. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on factors beyond its control.
its business also depends on the continued supply of battery packs for its vehicles. Phoenix is exposed to multiple risks relating to
availability and pricing of quality lithium-ion battery packs. 

Furthermore, currency fluctuations,
tariffs or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials and other economic or political conditions may result in significant increases
in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for its raw materials or components would increase its
operating costs, and could reduce its margins. In addition, a growth in popularity of electric vehicles without a significant expansion
in battery cell production capacity could result in shortages, which would result in increased costs in raw materials to us or impact
its prospects. 

Disruption of supply or shortage of raw
materials could harm Phoenix s business. 

Historically, Phoenix has
experienced significant delivery delays and supply shortage with its BOM components, battery packs in particular. When encountered with
supply disruption or shortage, its production plans and delivery schedules to its customers are to a large extent dictated by the timing
of receiving these BOM components, or when a different supplier is fully qualified and customized into its product design. For example,
COVID-19 has caused disruptions to and delays in its operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain parts, including
batteries and chassis. Although Phoenix has worked diligently with its suppliers to mitigate the risks, Phoenix expects supply chain delays
to continue to have a significant impact on its 2023 production and revenue and possibly thereafter. Any such supply interruption or shortage
could materially adversely affect its business and operating results. 

Phoenix EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which,
if not appropriately managed and controlled, have caught fire or released smoke and flames. Such events could result in liability under
Phoenix s warranties, for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall, any of which would hurt Phoenix s
prospects. 

The battery packs in Phoenix s
EVs use lithium-ion cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled can rapidly release energy by venting smoke and flames that
can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused attention
on the safety of these cells. These events also have raised questions about the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications.
There can be no assurance that a field failure of Phoenix s battery packs will not occur, which would damage the vehicle or lead
to personal injury or death that subject Phoenix to lawsuits. Furthermore, there is some risk of electrocution if individuals who attempt
to repair battery packs do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse
publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity could adversely affect Phoenix s business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results. 

72 

If Phoenix s vehicles fail to perform
as expected, its ability to develop, market and sell or lease its electric vehicles could be harmed. 

If Phoenix s vehicles
were to contain defects in design and/or manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, its ability to
develop, market and sell or lease its vehicles could be harmed. For example, the operation of its vehicles is highly dependent on software
that will require modification and updates over time. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when
first introduced. Phoenix currently has a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term quality, reliability and performance
characteristics of its buses, trucks, and other products. There can be no assurance that Phoenix will be able to detect and repair any
defects in its products before commencing the sale of its vehicles. Any product defects or any other failure of its vehicles to perform
as expected could harm its reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability
claims or significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, operating
results and prospects. 

Phoenix is relying on third-party suppliers
to develop a number of advanced technologies for use in its products. 

There can be no assurances
that its suppliers will be able to meet the technological requirements, production timing and volume requirements to support its business
plan. In addition, the technology may not comply with the cost, performance useful life and warranty characteristics Phoenix anticipates
in its business plan. As a result, its business plan could be significantly impacted and Phoenix may incur significant liabilities under
warranty claims which could adversely affect its business, prospects and results of operations. 

Phoenix is relying on a limited number of
third-party suppliers to provide us with products for its charger and material handling division. 

Currently Phoenix is dependent
entirely on third-party suppliers and partners for its chargers and material handling product lines. If these suppliers are not able to
provide us with products due to supply chain constrains or other reasons, Phoenix does not have the capability or knowledge to produce
these products locally. This would result in delays in getting end products to customers and negatively impact its business and results
of operations. 

Phoenix s success may be dependent
on its development and protection of intellectual property rights. 

Phoenix relies on confidentiality
and trade secret protections to protect its proprietary technology. All new EV drivetrain and technical developments by us will be owned
by us. its success will, in part, depend on its ability to obtain patents and trademarks and protect its trade secrets and proprietary
technology. Phoenix is currently maintaining its engineering under confidentiality agreements and other agreements to preserve its trade
secrets and other proprietary technology. Although Phoenix has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants
and contractors, its agreements may not adequately protect its intellectual property, particularly with respect to conflicts of ownership
relating to work product generated by its employees, consultants and contractors, and Phoenix cannot be certain that others will not gain
access to its trade secrets and other proprietary technology. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information
and techniques or otherwise gain access to its trade secrets. 

Phoenix may not succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening
its brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of its vehicles and components and its business, revenues and
prospects. 

Phoenix s business
and prospects heavily depend on its ability to develop, maintain and strengthen its brand. If Phoenix is not able to establish, maintain
and strengthen its brand, Phoenix may lose the opportunity to build a larger base of customers. its ability to develop, maintain and strengthen
its brand will depend heavily on the success of its marketing efforts. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and Phoenix may
not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening its brand. its current and potential competitors, particularly automobile
manufacturers headquartered in the United States, Japan, the European Union and China, have greater name recognition, broader customer
relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than Phoenix does. If Phoenix does not develop and maintain a strong brand,
its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted. 

73 

Phoenix s electric vehicles will compete for market share
with vehicles powered by other vehicle technologies that may prove to be more attractive than its vehicle technologies. 

Phoenix s bus and light
and medium-duty truck market currently is serviced by many manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely
accepted fuel technologies. Additionally, its competitors are working on developing technologies that may be introduced in its target
market. If any of these alternative technology vehicles can provide lower fuel costs, greater efficiencies, greater reliability or otherwise
benefit from other factors resulting in an overall lower total cost of ownership, this may negatively affect the commercial success of
its vehicles or make its vehicles uncompetitive. 

Phoenix may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle
technology as new entrants and existing, larger manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space. 

Phoenix s Zeus line
of buses and trucks are designed for use with, and is dependent upon, existing electric vehicle technology. As new companies and larger,
existing vehicle manufacturers enter the electric vehicle space, Phoenix may lose any technological advantage Phoenix may have had in
the marketplace and suffer a decline in its position in the market. As technologies change, Phoenix plans to upgrade or adapt its products
to continue to provide products with the latest technology. However, its products may become obsolete or its research and development
efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in or to create the necessary technology to effectively compete. As a result, its potential
inability to adapt to and develop the necessary technology may harm its competitive position. 

Phoenix s business requires highly technically skilled
personnel, for whom Phoenix must compete for employment. 

Phoenix s manufacturing
and research and development require highly skilled electrical, mechanical, and software engineers. Competition for employment of such
individuals is intense, and Phoenix s ability to attract and retained and retaining them is essential to continuing its business.
Growth of Phoenix s business will depend upon its ability to compete for increasing numbers of such employees, and there can be
no assurance that Phoenix will be able to do so. its inability to attract and retain key personnel may materially and adversely affect
its business operations. Any failure by its management to effectively anticipate, implement and manage the changes required to sustain
its growth would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Phoenix will also need to
hire and train a significant number of hourly employees to expand its commercial manufacturing operations. Furthermore, in the event employees
hired by us seek to join or form a labor union, Phoenix could be subject to risks as Phoenix engages in an attempt to finalize negotiations
with any such union, including potential work slowdowns or stoppages, delays and increased costs. If Phoenix is unsuccessful in hiring
and training an expanded workforce in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected. 

Phoenix is highly dependent on the services
of Liang Lance Zhou, its Chief Executive Officer. 

Phoenix is highly dependent
on the services of Liang Lance Zhou, its Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Zhou is the source of many, if not most, of the ideas and execution
driving its strategies and supply chains. If Mr. Zhou were to discontinue his service to us due to death, disability or any other reason,
Phoenix would be significantly disadvantaged.

Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares 

Our ordinary shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign
Companies Accountable Act HCFAA if the PCAOB is unable to adequately inspect audit documentation located in China. The delisting
of our ordinary shares or the threat of their being delisted, may have a material adverse impact on our listing and trading in the U.S.
and the trading prices of our ordinary shares. 

Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the HFCA
Act ), if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB ), is unable to inspect an issuer s auditors
for two consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited to trade on a U.S. stock exchange. The PCAOB issued a Determination
Report on December 16, 2021 (the Determination Report which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely
registered public accounting firms headquartered in: (1) mainland China of the People s Republic of China because of a position
taken by one or more authorities in mainland China; and (2) Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because
of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Determination Report identified the specific registered
public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations PCAOB Identified Firms ). 

The Company s current auditor, Marcum Asia CPAs LLP MarcumAsia ),
the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this annual report, as an auditor
of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the U.S. pursuant
to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. MarcumAsia, whose
audit report is included in this annual report, is headquartered in New York, New York, and, as of the date of this annual report, was
not included in the list of PCAOB Identified Firms in the Determination Report. 

On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it had signed a Statement
of Protocol (the Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC and the Ministry of
Finance MOF of the People s Republic of China, governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in
mainland China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to the Protocol, the PCAOB conducted inspections on select registered public accounting firms subject
to the Determination Report in Hong Kong between September and November 2022. 

On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB board announced that it has completed
the inspections, determined that it had complete access to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong Kong, and voted to vacate the Determination Report. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s ability to retain
an auditor subject to the PCAOB inspection and investigation, including but not limited to inspection of the audit working papers related
to us, may depend on the relevant positions of U.S. and Chinese regulators. Marcum Asia CPAs LLP s audit working papers related
to us are located in China. With respect to audits of companies with operations in China, there are uncertainties about the ability of
its auditor to fully cooperate with a request by the PCAOB for audit working papers in China without the approval of Chinese authorities.
If the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company s auditor because of a position taken by an authority in
a foreign jurisdiction, or the PCAOB re-evaluates its determination as a result of any obstruction with the implementation of the Statement
of Protocol, then such lack of inspection or re-evaluation could cause trading in the Company s securities to be prohibited under
the HFCA Act, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist the Company s securities. Accordingly,
the HFCA Act calls for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification
of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. 

On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, or the AHFCA Act, was signed into law, which reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions
under the HFCA Act from three years to two. As a result, the risks mentioned above have been heightened. 

75 

If our ordinary shares are subject to a trading prohibition under the
HFCA Act or the AHFCA Act, the price of our ordinary shares may be adversely affected, and the threat of such a trading prohibition would
also adversely affect their price. If we are unable to be listed on another securities exchange that provides sufficient liquidity, such
a trading prohibition may substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our ordinary shares when you wish to do so. 

We have significant equity overhang 
which could adversely affect the market price of our Shares and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity
securities. 

As of the date of this annual
report, we had 30,292,960 ordinary shares outstanding, including 6,023,204, ordinary shares, or approximately 19.88 of our total
ordinary shares outstanding, held by Mr. Xiaofeng Peng, our director, executive chairman of the board of directors and chief executive
officer. The possibility that substantial amounts of our outstanding ordinary shares may be sold by Mr. Xiaofeng Peng or the perception
that such sales could occur, or equity overhang, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, and could
impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. 

We are subject to litigation
risks, including securities class actions and shareholder derivative actions, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is
uncertain. 

From time to time, we are
subject to legal claims, with and without merit, that may be costly, and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources
in general. In addition, our solar projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability
to proceed with construction or grid connection or sell a given project, which would adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue
with respect to such project. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings. See Item 1. Business -Legal Proceedings. 
The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Lawsuits filed against us may assert types of claims that, if resolved
against us, could give rise to substantial damages, and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits, or any
future lawsuits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if these lawsuits
are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may not be covered by our insurance policies. We cannot assure you that
additional litigation will not be filed against us in the future. 

It may be difficult to effect service of
process on, or to enforce any judgments obtained against us, our directors, or our senior management members. 

There is no statutory enforcement
in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the federal or state courts of the United States (and the Cayman Islands are not a party
to any treaties for the reciprocal enforcement or recognition of such judgments). However, such a judgment will generally be recognized
and enforced at common law by the courts of the Cayman Islands, without any re-examination or re-litigation of the merits of the case,
by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt, provided that: (a) the foreign court had jurisdiction over the parties to the dispute;
(b) the judgment is for a liquidated sum; (c) the judgment is final, conclusive and not subject to appeal; (d) the judgment is not of
a public, revenue or penal nature; (e) the judgment was not obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice; (f) the enforcement
of the judgment would not be contrary to Cayman Islands public policy; (g) the judgment is not inconsistent with sections 91 or 92 of
the Trusts Act (as revised) of the Cayman Islands; (h) the process by which the judgment is enforced is not barred under laws relating
to the prescription and limitation of actions; and (i) the judgment is not inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the
same cause or point at issue between the same parties. 

However, the Cayman Islands
courts are unlikely to enforce a judgment obtained from the U.S. courts under civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities
law if such judgment is determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands to give rise to obligations to make payments that are penal or
punitive in nature. Because such a determination has not yet been made by a court of the Cayman Islands, it is uncertain whether such
civil liability judgments from U.S. courts would be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. 

76 

Our shareholders may experience future dilution. 

Our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association permits our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to authorize the issuance of preferred shares.
The board of directors may classify or reclassify any preferred shares to set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified
or reclassified shares, including the issuance of preferred shares that have preference rights over our ordinary shares with respect to
dividends, liquidation and voting rights. Furthermore, substantially all of our ordinary shares for which our outstanding stock options
are exercisable are, once they have been purchased, eligible for immediate sale in the public market. 

We may from time to time distribute
rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make these rights available in the United States
unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration
requirements is available. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or
to endeavor to cause a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. 

The issuance of additional
shares in our capital or the exercise of stock options or warrants could be substantially dilutive to your shares and may negatively affect
the market price of our ordinary shares. 

The price of our securities has been and
may continue to be highly volatile. 

The price of our ordinary
shares has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to many events or factors, including those
discussed in the preceding risk factors relating to our operations, as well as: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results, actual or anticipated gross profit as a percentage of net sales, our actual or anticipated rate of growth and our actual or anticipated earnings per share; 

changes in expectations as to future financial performance or changes in financial estimates; 

changes in governmental regulations or policies in the countries in which we do business; 

our, or a competitor s, announcement of new products, services or technological innovations; 

the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; 

news and commentary emanating from the media, securities analysts or government bodies relating to us and to the industry in general; 

77 

changes in the general condition of the global economy and credit markets; 

general market conditions or other developments affecting us or our industry; 

announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors; 

release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares; 

sales or perceived sales of additional ordinary shares; and 

commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation. 

Any of these factors may result
in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade. We cannot give any assurance that these factors
will not occur in the future again. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume
fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material
adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock,
many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in similar securities class action litigation
in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and could harm our
stock price, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we fail to meet the applicable listing
requirements, NASDAQ may delist our ordinary shares from trading on its exchange in which case the liquidity and market price of our securities
could decline and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely affected. 

Our ordinary shares are currently
listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If we remain listed, there are a number of requirements that must be met in order
for our ordinary shares to remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the failure to meet any of these listing standards could
result in the delisting of our ordinary shares from NASDAQ. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely file all required reports
or comply with all other NASDAQ Listing Rules at all times in the future, or regain compliance in a timely manner in case of a default
and avoid any subsequent adverse action taken by the Listing Qualifications Department, including but not limited to delisting. 

Our articles of association contain anti-takeover
provisions that could prevent a change in control even if such takeover is beneficial to our shareholders. 

Our articles of association
contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us that could be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions
could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate
actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay for the ordinary shares. These provisions
might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price
above the then current market price of our ordinary shares. These provisions provide that our board of directors has authority, without
any further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences,
privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the
rights associated with the ordinary shares. The board of directors may decide to issue such preferred shares quickly with terms calculated
to delay or prevent a change in control of us or make the removal of our management more difficult. If the board of directors decides
to issue such preferred shares, the price of our ordinary shares may fall and the voting and other rights of holders of our ordinary shares
may be materially adversely affected. 

78 

You may not receive dividends or other distributions
on our ordinary shares and you may not receive any value for them, if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you. 

Under Cayman Islands law,
we may only pay dividends out of our profits or share premium account subject to our ability to pay our debts as they fall due in the
ordinary course of our business. Our ability to pay dividends may therefore depend on our ability to generate sufficient profits. We cannot
give any assurance that we will declare dividends of any amounts, at any rate or at all in the future. We have not paid any dividends
in the past. Future dividends, if any, will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to requirements under Cayman
Islands law and our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and will depend upon our future
operations and earnings, capital expenditure requirements, general financial conditions, legal and contractual restrictions and other
factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 

We are treated as a U.S. corporation for
U.S. federal tax purposes. 

Due to the circumstances of
our formation and the application of Section 7874(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ),
we are treated as a U.S. corporation for all purposes of the Code. As a result, we are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on
our worldwide income. In addition, if we pay dividends to a Non-U.S. Holder, as defined in the discussion Item 10. Additional Information-E.
Taxation-U.S. Federal Income Taxation, U.S. income tax will be withheld at the rate of 30 , or, subject to certain conditions,
such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable income tax treaty. Each investor should consult its own tax adviser regarding the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding the ordinary shares in its particular circumstances. 

Risks Related to Our International Operations 

We are subject to risks associated with
foreign currency exchange rates, fluctuations of which may negatively affect our revenue, cost of goods sold and gross margins and could
result in exchange losses. 

We currently operate in a
number of jurisdictions including the U.S., Japan, U.K., Greece, Italy, Australia and Canada, and our local operations are generally conducted
in the functional currency of the home jurisdiction. The FIT and other subsidies granted are also denominated in local currencies. Thus,
we deal on a regular basis in several currencies concurrently, which exposes us to significant currency exchange risks. Any increased
costs or reduced revenue as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our profit margins. The fluctuation
of foreign exchange rates also affects the value of our monetary and other assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies. Generally,
an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the relevant local currencies could result in a foreign exchange loss for assets denominated
in such local currencies and a foreign exchange gain for liabilities denominated in such local currencies. Conversely, a devaluation of
the U.S. dollar against the relevant local currencies could result in a foreign exchange gain for assets denominated in such local currencies
and a foreign exchange loss for liabilities denominated in such local currencies. 

We may also expand into emerging
markets, some of which may have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy. Conducting business in such emerging
markets could increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. Although we access a variety of financing solutions that are tailored to
the geographic location of our projects and to local regulations, we have not entered into any hedging transactions to reduce the foreign
exchange risks, but may do so in the future when appropriate. However, if we decide to hedge our foreign exchange exposure in the future,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce our foreign currency risk exposure in an effective manner, at reasonable costs, or
at all. 

79 

General Risk Factors 

Misconduct and errors by our employees could
harm our business and reputation. 

We are exposed to many types
of operational risks, including the risk of misconduct, errors and fraud by our employees and key management personnel. Our training,
resources, technologies and fraud detection tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. Significant increases in
fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation, which could increase our costs and expenses. High profile fraudulent
activity could even lead to regulatory intervention, and may divert our management s attention and cause us to incur additional
expenses and costs. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely
affected. 

Failure to manage our evolving business
could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

We intend to expand our business
within our existing markets and in a number of selected new locations in the future. We also intend to expand our global project development
business in the future. As our operations evolve, we expect to encounter additional challenges in our internal management, construction
contracting management, investment and acquisition management, project management, project funding infrastructure and financing capabilities.
Our existing operations, personnel, systems and internal control may not be adequate to support our business expansion and may require
new investments in our internal management infrastructure. To manage the future growth of our operations, we will be required to improve
our administrative, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and maintain, expand, train and manage a growing number
of employees. 

We may continue to conduct acquisitions and enter into joint
ventures, investments or other strategic alliances which may be unsuccessful. 

We may continue to grow our
operations through acquisitions, as well as joint ventures or other strategic alliances when appropriate opportunities arise. Such acquisitions,
joint ventures and strategic alliances may expose us to additional operational, regulatory, market and geographical risks as well as risks
associated with additional capital requirements and diversion of management attention. In particular, any future strategic alliances may
expose us to the following risks: 

There may be unforeseen risks relating to our counterparty s business and operations or liabilities that were not discovered by us through our legal and business due diligence prior to our investment. Such undetected risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations in the future. 

We may not have experience acquiring, managing or investing in other companies. Business acquisitions may generally divert a significant portion of our management and financial resources from our existing business and the integration of the target s operations may pose significant business challenges, potentially straining our ability to finance and manage our existing operations. 

There is no assurance that the expected synergies from any business acquisition, joint venture or strategic alliances will materialize. If we are not successful in the integration of a target s operations, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from its operations to recover costs and expenses of the acquisition. 

Acquisition or participation in a new joint venture or strategic alliance may involve us in the management of operation in which we do not possess extensive expertise. 

The materialization of any of these risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

80 

Our failure to protect our intellectual
property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly. 

We rely primarily on trade
secrets, know-how and other proprietary information to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, these afford only limited protection
and the actions we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to provide us with meaningful protection or commercial
advantage. Third parties may be able to use the technologies that we have developed and compete with us, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
rights may undermine our competitive position. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual
property and proprietary rights. Policing the unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. In particular,
the laws and enforcement procedures certain markets where we operate are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as do the laws and enforcement procedures of the United States. We may need to resort to court proceedings to enforce our
intellectual property rights in the future. Litigation relating to our intellectual property might result in substantial costs and diversion
of resources and management attention away from our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual
property rights and adversely affect our business, prospects and reputation. 

We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation
claims by third parties which, if determined adversely to us, could cause us to pay significant damage awards. 

Our success depends largely
on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The
validity and scope of claims relating to solar technology involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore,
may be highly uncertain. As we continue to expand internationally, we face a heightened risk of becoming the subject of claims for intellectual
property infringement. We may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights
of third parties. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings against us could subject us to significant liabilities
to third parties, including requiring us to seek licenses from third parties, to pay ongoing royalties or to pay monetary and punitive
damages. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their procurement of our
PV solutions until resolution of such litigation, which could result in losses and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. 

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
may ultimately prove to be incorrect. 

The accounting estimates and
judgments that management must make in the ordinary course of business affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. If the underlying
estimates are ultimately proven to be incorrect, subsequent adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
for the period or periods in which the change is identified. 

The COVID-19 pandemic, including its variants,
has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we operate. 

Our business and financial condition have been,
and could continue to be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy
and has impacted our business. The effects of COVID-19, such as the widespread growth in infections, travel restrictions, quarantines,
return-to-work restrictions, government regulations, supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and site closures have impacted and
may continue to impact our ability to staff sales and operations centers and install and maintain solar energy systems in the field, as
well as direct-to-home sales activities. The rise and resurgence of increasingly infectious variants, despite efforts to combat the virus
with vaccinations, has presented additional challenges and unpredictability that have, and may continue to have, resulted in workforce
constraints, delays, and additional costs, particularly in regions experiencing significant outbreaks. 

81 

The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to significant
volatility in global financial markets, which could negatively affect our cost of and access to capital and could have an adverse impact
on customer demand and the financial health and credit risk associated with our customers. Future disruptions or instability in capital
markets could also negatively impact our ability to raise capital from third parties, such as tax equity partners, to grow our business.
In addition, significant inflation, a recession, or a market correction resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic has and could
continue to adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. The full economic impact of the pandemic is still not known. 

COVID-19 has caused disruptions to the supply
chain across the global economy, including within the solar industry. Certain suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience,
delays related to a variety of factors, including logistical delays, and component shortages from upstream vendors. We continue to monitor
the situation and are working closely with our solar partners and suppliers to develop contingency plans for potential operations and
supply chain interruptions. 

The ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly
uncertain, beyond our control, dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted, and subject to change. We will continue
to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, and our business operations generally and will take additional actions
that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate the impacts, however, any steps we take may be inadequate and, as a result, our business
may be harmed. 

Our business could be negatively impacted
by cybersecurity threats, attacks and other disruptions. 

We face advanced and persistent
attacks on our information infrastructure where we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive/confidential data relating
to our operations. These attacks may include sophisticated malware (viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs) and phishing
emails that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. These intrusions sometimes may be zero-day malware
that are difficult to identify because they are not included in the signature set of commercially available antivirus scanning programs.
Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential
information or that of our customers or other third-parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Additionally, sophisticated
software and applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs 
and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the information infrastructure. A disruption, infiltration
or failure of our information infrastructure systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer
viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security,
loss of critical data and performance delays, which in turn could adversely affect our business. 

Security breaches of confidential customer
information or confidential employee information may adversely affect our business. 

Our business requires the
collection, transmission and retention of customer and employee data, and other personally identifiable information, in various information
technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The integrity
and protection of that customer and employee data is critical to us. The information, security and privacy requirements imposed by governmental
regulation are increasingly demanding. Our systems may not be able to satisfy these changing requirements and customer and employee expectations,
or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so. A breach in the security of our information technology systems
or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies
and a loss of profits. Additionally, a significant theft, loss or misappropriation of, or access to, customers or other proprietary
data or other breach of our information technology systems could result in fines, legal claims or proceedings. 

82 

The costs of our operations may exceed our
estimates due to factors outside of our control, such as labor shortages or external price increases, and we may be unable to pass those
costs to our customers, which would negatively impact our financial results. 

We depend on our employees
and contracted grow operations teams to grow and distribute our products to our customers. We rely on access to competitive, local labor
supply, including skilled and unskilled positions, to operate our business consistently and reliably. Any labor shortage, caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, and any disruption in our ability to hire workers would negatively affect our operations and financial
condition. If we experience a sustained labor shortage, we may need to increase wages to attract workers, which would increase our costs
of growing our products. Furthermore, if the prices of our raw materials, utilities or distributing our products were to increase, including
due to inflationary pressures, we may be unable to pass those increased costs on to our customers. If we are unable to do so, our gross
margin would decline, and our financial results would be negatively impacted. 

Invasion of Ukraine could disrupt our delivery
and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

On February 24, 2022,
the Russian Federation launched an invasion of Ukraine that has had an immediate impact on the global economy resulting in higher energy
prices and higher prices for certain raw materials and goods and services which in turn is contributing to higher inflation in the United
States and other countries across the globe with significant disruption to financial markets. We do not have any operations or business
in Russia or Ukraine, however, we may be potentially indirectly adversely impacted any significant disruption it has caused and may continue
to escalate. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia which increases the risk that Russia
may resort to retaliatory actions, including the launching of cyberattacks. It is possible that these attacks could have collateral effects
on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally, which could adversely affect our operations. It is difficult
to assess the likelihood of such threat and any potential impact at this time. Any one or more of these events may impede our operation
and delivery efforts and adversely affect our sales results, or even for a prolonged period of time, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Volatility and increases in interest rates
raise our cost of capital and may adversely impact our business. 

While interest rates have been at long-term historic lows in recent
years, they have recently increased, and may continue increasing in the near future. Rising interest rates, including recent historic
increases starting in 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, have and may continue to result in a decrease in our advance rates, reducing
the proceeds we receive from certain investment funds. Because our financing structure is sensitive to volatility in interest rates, higher
rates increase our cost of capital and may decrease the amount of capital available to us to finance the deployment of new solar energy
systems. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital from fund investors and obtain secured lending to help finance the
deployment of our solar service offerings. Part of our business strategy is to seek to reduce our cost of capital through these arrangements
to improve our margins, offset reductions in government incentives and maintain the price competitiveness of our solar service offerings.
Rising base interest rates or credit spreads, which have, and may continue to be worsened by inflation, an economic recession, or other
variables, may have an adverse impact on our ability to offer attractive pricing on our solar service offerings to customers, which could
negatively impact sales of our solar energy offerings, and our cash flows.

ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion
may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under
 Item 1A.- Risk Factors or in other parts of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

A. 
 Operating Results 

We are a global provider of
photovoltaic (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) solutions for business, residential, government and utility customers and investors. We develop
solar PV projects which are either sold to third party operators or owned and operated by us for selling of electricity to the grid in
multiple countries in Asia, North America and Europe. In Australia, we primarily sell solar PV components to retail customers and solar
project developers. We started to engage in sales and leasing of new zero-emission EVs in U.S. from 2020, engage in roofing and solar
energy systems installation in U.S. from 2021 and also started to assemble solar modules for sale in U.S. in 2022. 

Our liquidity position has
deteriorated since 2015. We suffered net losses of 44.8 million and 33.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
We also had an accumulated deficit of 670.8 million and a working capital deficit of 107.7 million as of December 31, 2022. For a detailed
discussion, please see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -B. Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Resources and Material Known Facts on Liquidity. 

Our operating results for
future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if we will be able to reduce or eliminate our net losses for
the foreseeable future. We have developed a plan to continue implementing various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses
within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) negotiate with potential buyers on PV solar projects; 2) negotiate for postponing
of convertible bond payments; 3) improve the profitability of the business in the United States ; 4) proactively implement a robust capital
market strategy that includes both debt and equity offerings to meet the Group s financing needs; 5) strictly control and reduce
business, marketing and advertising expenses and 6) seek for certain credit facilities. 

If we fail to
achieve these goals, we may need additional financing to repay debt obligations and execute our business plan, and we may not be able
to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are
not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, we may be unable to implement
our current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect our ability to continue as a
going concern. 

85 

Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of
Operations 

We believe that the following
factors have had, and we expect that they will continue to have, a significant effect on the development of our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

COVID-19 

The continued effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted
and may continue to adversely impact our supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of
our suppliers, dealers and customers. There is continued uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, particularly
with the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and periodic spikes in COVID-19 cases in various geographic regions, and the impacts on
our business and the global economy from the effects of the pandemic and response measures. 

Our operating results substantially
depend on revenues derived from sales of PV project assets, provision of electricity, our Australian subsidiary s trading of PV
components, and our U.S. subsidiary s business on roofing and solar energy systems installation, sales and leasing of EVs, sales
of forklift and sales of solar modules, respectively. Travel and logistics restrictions, lockdowns, vaccine requirements and other measures
from time to time implemented by foreign and domestic authorities have resulted in, and may continue to result in, supply chain and transportation
disruptions, production delays and capacity limitations for the Company and some of our suppliers, dealers and customers, as well as reduced
workforce availability or productivity, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce
working remotely. 

The degree to which the pandemic
ultimately impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments
beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic,
the extent, duration and effectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy
of COVID-19 vaccines, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration
of resulting global economic volatility. We believe the most significant elements of uncertainty are the intensity and duration of the
impact by our customers, partners, service providers or suppliers as well as the ability of our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing,
and distribution to continue to operate with minimal disruption, all of which could negatively impact our financial position, results
of operations, cash flows and outlook. 

Market Demand 

Our revenue and profitability
depend substantially on the demand for our PV solutions, which is driven by the economics of PV systems, including the availability and
size of government subsidies and other incentives, government support, cost improvements in solar power, as well as environmental concerns
and energy demand. The world PV market in terms of new annual installations is expected to grow significantly in the next five years,
providing engineering procurement construction EPC service providers and solar project developers like us with significant
opportunities to grow our business. 

86 

In the long term, as PV technology
advances and the average system costs of solar projects decrease, we expect the market for electricity in a growing number of countries
to achieve grid parity. As the PV industry becomes more competitive against other energy industries and widespread grid parity strengthens
demand for solar projects, we expect our costs of sales to decrease and our revenue and profitability to increase. 

In addition, the medium-duty
EV market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade and there are many key factors are shaping the industry for accelerated
growth over the next few years. Key factors driving this growth include government regulations requiring fleets to go electric, incentives
and grant funding supporting commercial zero emission vehicle deployments, infrastructure deployments and corporate electrification mandates.
Many large fleets who operate large truck and bus fleets have committed to go 100 electric over the next few years. This includes large
delivery truck fleets like Amazon, FedEx, UPS, DHL, IKEA; also shuttle bus operators like transit agencies in Los Angeles, Orange County,
and New York; and large corporate fleet owners like Genentech, Microsoft and Salesforce. All of the above factors, together with key technology
catalysts, are expected to spur demand for medium-duty electric vehicles significantly over the next few years. Key technology drivers
include reduction in battery costs and costs of other key components, making electric vehicles cheaper, and advances in EV drivetrain
technology, including motor improvements that enable better performance and higher efficiencies; and refinements in high-voltage battery
technology. The anticipated sales growth in this segment of the EV market is attributed both to new companies that started as electric
vehicle manufacturers, as well as and conventional OEMs who are expected to start offering complete EV over the next few years. 

As PV and energy storage technology
advances and the average system costs decrease, in many cases the residential or small business owners of solar systems have effectively
achieved grid parity for their systems. Aided by smart meter and virtual power plant technologies such systems can be an attractive alternative
to electricity grid in many localities. We expect traditionally strong residential solar markets such as California and Australia to continue
to grow. We anticipate capturing scale economies as the overall solar power market grows, and expect our cost of sales to decrease and
our revenue and profitability to increase. 

Government Subsidies and Incentive Policies 

We believe that the growth
of the solar power industry in the short term will continue to depend largely on the availability and effectiveness of government incentives
for solar power products and the competitiveness of solar power in relation to conventional and other renewable energy resources in terms
of cost. Countries in Europe, notably Italy, Germany, France, Belgium and Spain, certain countries in Asia, including Japan, India and
South Korea, as well as Australia and the United States have adopted favorable renewable energy policies. Examples of government sponsored
financial incentives to promote solar power include capital cost rebates, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end users,
distributors, project developers, system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products. 

Governments may reduce or
eliminate existing incentive programs for political, financial or other reasons, which will be difficult for us to predict. Electric utility
companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant
legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams. Government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated altogether. 

With growing emphasis on improving
air quality around our communities, large states like California are mandating key end user segments to switch to zero emission transportation
options. Some of the key regulations driving growth in our addressable market include: 

requiring all transit buses in California to be zero emissions
by 2040; 

requiring all airport shuttles in California to be all electric
by 2035, 

requiring at least 50 of all medium-duty trucks sold in California
to electric by 2030, 

requiring specific end user segments like drayage and yard trucks
to go electric. 

87 

Other states like New York,
New Jersey and Massachusetts are also expected to bring in regulatory requirements for key end user segments like, transit agencies and
school buses to switch to all electric transportation options. Fifteen other states including Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington have committed to follow
California s Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation. Primarily driven by the urgent need to meet carbon and greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets, various state and federal agencies are also supporting the switch to zero emission transportation, providing a host of funding
and incentive support to develop, demonstrate and deploy zero emission transportation solutions. Some of the key funding / incentives
driving adoption of electric medium duty vehicles include: 

the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher
Incentive Project, which offers a minimum of 60,000 per vehicle as incentive for Class 4 electric vehicles registered and operating
in the state; 

the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program offering up to 100,000
per Class 4 electric vehicle; 

funding from federal agencies like the Federal Transit Administration,
covering up to 80 of the cost of procuring electric transit buses and various funding options covering up to 100 of the cost of procuring
all electric school buses across key states. 

Federal and various state agencies have established incentives
for setting up both public and private charging infrastructure. Notably, the California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities
Commission have approved funding up to 100 of the cost of setting up chargers and related infrastructure. Large utilities like Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric have Charge Ready programs that cover the
entire cost of setting up charging infrastructure. Other states like New York, Chicago, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio have
also introduced programs to support fleets with their charging infrastructure requirements. 

Our Solar Power Generation and Operations
Capabilities 

Our financial condition and
results of operations depend on our ability to successfully continue to develop new solar projects and operate our existing solar projects.
We expect to build and manage a greater number of solar projects, which we expect to present additional challenges to our internal processes,
external construction management, working capital management and financing capabilities. Our financial condition, results of operations
and future success depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to continue to identify suitable sites, expand our pipeline of projects
with attractive returns, obtain required regulatory approvals, arrange necessary financing, manage the construction of our solar projects
on time and within budget, and successfully operate solar projects.

United States 

Based on Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB staff Q A Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), the FASB staff noted that the Company must
make an accounting policy election to either (1) recognize taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a
current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method or (2) factor such amount into the Company s measure
of its deferred taxes (the deferred method ). The Company elected to treat GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.
The Company has not recognized GILTI expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as there were either no earnings from controlled foreign
corporations or the hightax exclusion applied. 

Hong Kong 

According to Tax (Amendment)
(No. 3) Ordinance 2018 published by Hong Kong government, form April 1, 2018, under the two-tiered profits tax rates regime, the profits
tax rate for the first HKD2 million of assessable profits will be lowered to 8.25 (half of the rate specified in Schedule 8 to the Inland
Revenue Ordinance (IRO)) for corporations. No provision for Hong Kong tax has been made in our consolidated financial statements, as our
Hong Kong subsidiary had not generated any assessable income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our subsidiaries incorporated
in Hong Kong were exempted from the Hong Kong income tax on its foreign-derived income and there were no withholding taxes in Hong Kong
on the remittance of dividends. 

See Item 1. Business 
- Taxation for more information. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Out of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 3-Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, certain accounting policies
are deemed critical, as they require management s highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. While management
believes its judgments, estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based on information presently available and actual results
may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

90 

Revenue Recognition 

Our accounting practices under
Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 
or Topic 606 are as followings: 

We generate revenue from sales
of PV components, roofing and solar systems installation, electricity revenue with Power Purchase Agreements PPAs ), sales
of PV project assets, sales and leasing of EVs and others. 

Sale of PV components.
 Revenue on sale of PV components includes one performance obligation of delivering the products and the revenue is recognized at a
point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or acceptance of
the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. 

Roofing and solar systems
installation. Revenue from roofing and solar energy system installation is recognized over time. For revenue from solar energy system
installation, our only performance obligation is to design and install a customized solar energy system, or to reinstall the customer s
existing solar energy system. For revenue from roofing, our only performance obligation is to design and build the roof system per customer
specifications. Our roofing projects involve the construction of a specific roof systems in accordance with each customer s selection;
our solar energy system installations involve solar modules being retrofitted to existing consumer roofs using rails, then connected to
the utility using an inverter system. For both solar energy system installation and roofing, typically jobs are completed within three
months, the specific timing depends on the size of the job and the complexity of the job site, and the contract price includes all material
and labor needed, and payments are collected based on specific milestones. 

We provide solar energy systems
and roofing installation for various customers, such as homeowners and real estate developers, but the design and installation for each
customer differs substantially on the basis of each customer s needs and the type of shingle or roof that is placed with the solar
energy system. The asset consequently has no alternative use to us because the customer specific design limits our practical ability to
readily direct the solar energy system to another customer. As such our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to
us. Pursuant to the contract, the customers agree to pay for any costs, expenses and losses incurred by us upon termination, and therefore,
revenue is recognized over time according to ASC 606-10-25-27(c). 

For both solar energy system
installation and roofing, all costs to obtain and fulfill contracts associated with system sales and other product sales are expensed
to cost of revenue when the corresponding revenue is recognized. 

The Group recognizes revenue
using a cost-based input method that recognizes revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual
costs incurred compared to the total estimated cost of the contract, to determine our progress towards contract completion and to calculate
the corresponding amount of revenue and gross profit to recognize. The total estimated cost of the contract constitutes of material cost
and labor cost, and are developed based on the size and specific situation of different jobs. Changes in estimates mainly due to: (i)
unforeseen field conditions that impacts the estimated workload, and (ii) change of the unit price of material or labor cost. 

If the estimated total costs
on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. 

Electricity revenue with
PPAs. We sell energy generated by PV solar power systems under PPAs. For energy sold under PPAs, we recognize revenue each period
based on the volume of energy delivered to the customer (i.e., the PPAs off-taker) and the price stated in the PPAs. We have determined
that none of the PPAs contains a lease since (i) the purchaser does not have the rights to operate the PV solar power systems, (ii) the
purchaser does not have the rights to control physical access to the PV solar power systems, and (iii) the price that the purchaser pays
is at a fixed price per unit of output. 

91 

Sale of PV project asset.
 Our sales arrangements for PV projects do not contain any forms of continuing involvement that may affect the revenue or profit recognition
of the transactions, nor any variable considerations for energy performance guarantees, minimum electricity end subscription commitments.
The Company therefore determined its single performance obligation to the customer is the sale of a completed solar project. We recognize
revenue for sales of solar projects at a point in time after the solar project has been grid connected and the customer obtains control
of the solar project. 

Revenue from sales and
leasing of EV . We recognize revenue from sales of EV at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the
customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery to the customer for EV sales. We determined that the government grants related to sales
of EV should be considered as part of the transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyer and the buyer remains liable for such
amount in the event the grants were not received by us or returned due to the buyer violates the government grant terms and conditions.
EV leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for direct leasing programs. We account for these leasing
transactions as operating leases under ASC 842 Leases, and revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term. 

Other revenue. Other revenue mainly consist
of sales of self-assembled solar modules, sales of component and charging stations, sales of forklifts, engineering and maintenance service,
shipping and delivery service, sales of pre-development solar projects and others. Other revenues are recognized at a point in time following
the transfer of control of such service or products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment of product or acceptance of
the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

Our long-lived assets include
property, plant and equipment, project assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets with finite lives. We evaluate long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by that asset or asset group from its use and eventual disposition to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent
that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash
flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Any impairment write-downs would be
treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and a charge to statement of operations would be recognized. 

We review project assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider a project
commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed.
We consider a partially developed or partially constructed project commercially viable or recoverable if the anticipated selling price
is higher than the carrying value of the related project assets. We examine a number of factors to determine if the project is expected
to be recoverable, including whether there are any changes in environmental, permitting, market pricing, regulatory, or other conditions
that may impact the project. Such changes could cause the costs of the project to increase or the selling price of the project to decrease.
If a project is not considered recoverable, we impair the respective project assets and adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair
value. 

The judgments and estimates
involved in identifying and quantifying the impairment of long-lived assets involve inherent uncertainties, and the measurement of the
fair value is dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions used in making the estimates and how those estimates compare to our future
operating performance. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment and record an impairment charge of 2.0 million, for impairment of
project assets and right of use assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no impairment
charges recorded related to long-lived assets. 

92 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of raw materials is determined on the basis of weighted average cost method. The cost
of finished goods is determined on the basis of weighted average and comprises direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion
of overhead. Net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices less selling expenses and any further costs expected to be incurred
for completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence,
or impaired balances if any. We evaluate the recoverability of our inventories based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions.
Our assumption of expected demand is developed based on our analysis of sales backlog, market forecast, and competitive intelligence.
Our assumption of expected demand is compared to available inventory, production capacity, available third-party inventory, and growth
plans. 

During the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2022, inventories were written down by 1.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively, to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable
value. 

Share-Based Compensation 

Our share-based payment transactions
with employees, such as restricted shares and share options, are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instrument
granted. The fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award on a straight line basis, which is generally the vesting period.
Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. 

We estimate the fair value
of service-based stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula, which requires the use of highly subjective and
complex assumptions. If we had made different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share of common
stock could have been significantly different. See Note 19 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report
for information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine
the estimated fair value of our stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. 

Accounts Receivables and Allowance for Credit
Losses 

We grant open credit terms
to credit-worthy customers. Accounts receivable are primarily related to the Group's sales of PV components, revenue from roofing and
solar energy systems installation, electricity revenue with PPA, sales of solar modules and sales of EVs and forklifts. 

We maintain allowances for
credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Accounts receivable is considered
past due based on its contractual terms. In establishing the allowance, management considers historical losses, the financial condition,
the accounts receivables aging, the payment patterns and the forecasted information in pooling basis upon the use of the Current Expected
Credit Loss Model CECL Model in accordance with ASC topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Accounts receivable
that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote. There is a time lag between when the Company estimates a portion of or the entire account balances
to be uncollectible and when a write off of the account balances is taken. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related
to our customers. Contractually, we may charge interest for extended payment terms and require collateral. 

Provision for credit losses
is 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and reversal of credit loss is 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

93 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
of the acquired entity as a result of our acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment
on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. We have an option to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative
assessment, we consider primary factors such as industry and market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit,
and other specific information related to the operations. Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the
fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed. 

In performing the quantitative
impairment test, we compare the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each
reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair
value; the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Application of a goodwill
impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets, liabilities
and goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting
units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates
and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. 

We tested goodwill for impairment as of December
31, 2021 and 2022 by performing a qualitative assessment test and no impairment indicator was noted. 

Derivative Instruments 

We evaluate our convertible
debt to determine if the contract or embedded component of the contract qualifies as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance
with ASC 480, Distinguish by Liabilities from Equity , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The result of
this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative, if required to be bifurcated, is marked-to-market at each
balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. The change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon
conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value
is reclassified to equity. 

Derivative liability as of
December 31, 2021 and 2022 is nil and 3.4 million, respectively, with the change in fair value of 67 thousands and negative 0.2 million
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

We account for income taxes under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if
it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

94 

We recognize in the consolidated financial statements
the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits
of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management presumes that
the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a
tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized
in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
realized upon settlement. Our tax liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances,
such as the progress of the tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely
in the period in which they are identified. We record interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax position, if and when required,
as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No reserve for uncertain tax positions was recorded for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We do not expect that the assessment regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change
over the next 12 months. We are not currently under examination by an income tax authority, nor have been notified that an examination
is contemplated.

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2022
to the year ended December 31, 2021 

Net revenues 
Net revenues were 162.0 million and 177.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase
of 15.5 million or 9.6 . The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the comparative period was primarily due
to revenue increase from sales of PV components of 10.8 million, Electricity revenue increase with PPAs of 1.1 million and revenue increase
from sales of self-assembled solar modules, sales of component and charging stations, sales of forklifts and others of 6.7 million, partially
net off by the decrease of revenue from roofing and solar systems installation of 3.1 million. 

Cost of revenues 
Cost of revenues was 151.4 million (93.4 of net revenues) and 163.0 million (91.8 of net revenues) for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of 11.7 million or 7.7 . The increase in cost of goods sold was in consistent with
the increase of net revenues. 

Gross profit 
Our gross profit increased from 10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to 14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Gross margins were 6.6 and 8.2 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily
due to we focused more on sales of battery and inverter instead of sales of panel in the year ended December 31, 2022, where battery and
inverter products have a higher GP ratio than panels. 

96 

General and administrative
expenses General and administrative expenses were 41.8 million (25.8 of net revenues) and 35.6 million (20.0 of net revenues)
for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an decrease of 6.2 million, or 14.9 . The decrease was mainly
due to the decrease in stock-based compensation expense and research and development expenses. 

Sales, marketing and
customer service expenses Sales, marketing and customer service expenses were 7.6 million (4.7 of net revenues) and 5.0 million (2.8 of net revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an decrease of 2.6
million, or 33.7 . The decrease was mainly due to the decrease of the amortization of customer list and work in process contracts
purchased from the PDI acquisition in the year of 2021. 

Provision for credit loss 
In 2021 and 2022, we accrued credit loss provision of 2.7 million (1.7 of net revenues) and 0.6 million (0.3 of net revenues), respectively.
The decrease was mainly due to the reversal of provision for the accounts receivable generated from the business of roofing and solar
energy systems installation in 2022. 

Impairment charges on long-lived
assets We accrued nil and 2.0 million impairment loss (1.1 of net revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2022, respectively. The increase was due to impairment of our right-of-use assets in our renewable energy solutions segment and project
assets in our solar projects development segment. 

Interest expense, net 
Interest expense net was 5.1 million (3.2 of net revenues) and 7.2 million (4.1 of net revenues) for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of 2.1 million, or 40.0 . The increase in interest expense was primarily due to
amortization of debt discount of convertible bonds and interest accrued from new convertible bonds. 

Loss on extinguishment
of convertible bonds We recorded nil and 2.6 million impairment loss (1.5 of net revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2021 and 2022, respectively. The loss came from the extinguishment of the convertible bonds during the current year. 

Net foreign exchange gain
 We had a net foreign exchange loss of 2.7 million (1.7 of net revenues) and a net foreign exchange gain of 2.6 million
(1.4 of net revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The variance is mainly due the fluctuation of exchange
rate for EUR/USD and AUD/USD. 

Forgiveness of PPP Loan 
We generated Forgiveness of PPP Loan of 0.2 million (0.1 of net revenues) and 5.1 million (2.9 of net revenues) for the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2022. 

Income tax expense
 We had a provision for income taxes of 1.5 million (0.9 of net revenues) and 2.0 million (1.1 of net revenues) for
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of 0.5 million, or 37.0 . The increase was
mainly due to the increase in profit before tax of our subsidiary in Australia. 

Net loss For
the foregoing reasons, we incurred a net loss of 33.7 million (19.0 of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing
a decrease of net loss of 11.1 million compared to a net loss of 44.8 million (24.8 of net revenues) for the year ended December
31, 2021.

B. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Historically, we have financed
our operations primarily through cash flows from bank borrowings, financing from issuance of convertible bonds, operating activities,
and the proceeds from private placements and registered offerings. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had 11.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash. 

We have recurring losses from
operations. We have incurred a net loss of 33.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had a working
capital deficit of 107.7 million and the cash flow used in the operation activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 16.0 million.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

For the next 12 months from
the issuance date of this report, we plan to continue implementing various measures to boost revenue and control the cost and expenses
within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) negotiate with potential buyers on PV solar projects; 2) negotiate for postponing
of convertible bond payments; 3) improve the profitability of the business in the United States ; 4) proactively implement a robust capital
market strategy that includes both debt and equity offerings to meet the Group s financing needs; 5) strictly control and reduce
business, marketing and advertising expenses and 6) seek for certain credit facilities. 

If
we fail to achieve these goals, we may need additional financing to repay debt obligations and execute our business plan, and we may not
be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources
are not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our gross profit margin and reducing operating losses, we may be unable to
implement our current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may materially adversely affect our ability to continue
as a going concern. 

The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Trend information 

Our operating results substantially
depend on revenues derived from s sales of PV project assets, provision of electricity, our Australian subsidiary s trading of PV
components, and our U.S. subsidiary s business on roofing and solar energy systems installation, sales and leasing of EVs, sales
of forklift and sales of solar modules, respectively. The COVID 19 pandemic has created and continues to create various global macroeconomic,
customer demand, operational and supply chain risks, any one of which could have an adverse impact on our business going forward. 

Other than as disclosed elsewhere
in this prospectus, the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events for 2022 are reasonably likely to have a material
effect on our net revenues, income, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported consolidated financial
information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial conditions: 

Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction
Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The 370 billion allocated to climate and clean energy investments dramatically
expands tax credits and incentives to deploy more clean vehicles, including commercial vehicles, while supporting a domestic EV supply
chain and charging infrastructure buildout. IRA transportation sector provisions will accelerate the shift to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)
by combining consumer and manufacturing policies. The IRA extends the existing tax credit for electric vehicles and establishes a new
tax credit for used electric vehicles, as well as establishes a new tax credit for commercial ZEVs. Under the IRA, commercial ZEVs will
be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to the lesser of 30 of the sales price or the incremental cost of a comparable ICE-engine
vehicle, capped at 7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds and 40,000 for all others. In addition, governmental entities may also be
eligible to claim these credits. Vehicles final assembly must be in North America to be eligible for the federal tax credit, but
commercial vehicles are exempt from the battery or mineral sourcing requirements that apply to consumer electric vehicles. The federal
tax credit on charging equipment has been extended through 2032. For commercial uses, the tax credit is 6 with a maximum credit of 100,000
per unit. The equipment must be placed in a low-income community or non-urban area. The IRS has yet to release further guidance on specific
aspects of the aforementioned credits. The announcement of the IRA and the delay in receiving IRS guidance as to the roll-out of the new
tax credits has reduced the number of customer orders during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, as many existing
or potential customers are waiting to place orders until they are certain of the amount of tax credits available per ZEV. In addition,
many customers are evaluating the size and type of ZEV they intend to purchase because the amount of the tax credit depends on the weight
of the vehicle, among other factors. Furthermore, other government programs, such as the FTA's Low- and No-Emission Vehicle Program or
certain state programs, recently announced new funding and are in the process of making these funds available for eligible purchases.
Until these processes are established, we believe, customer orders may be delayed. 

Supply-chain challenges. We have experienced
significant delivery delays from our suppliers from beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic through most of 2022. In addition, we often do
not get informed of delivery delays until or after the expected delivery dates and have, at times, also experienced deliveries in advance
of expected delivery dates without prior notice (for orders that were previously delayed), which does not allow for adequate planning.
We have also experienced shortages of chassis and other components. As a result of these planning challenges, we have increased our inventory
of raw materials and critical components, such as chassis, batteries or motors, and added new suppliers to optimize cost, minimize supply
chain issues and prepare for an increase in future production. However, adding new suppliers, especially for chassis, increases requirements
for working capital and places us at the mercy of price volatility. We expect supply chain challenges will continue for the foreseeable
future. 

Inflation and interest rates. We are
experiencing cost increases due to inflation resulting from various supply chain disruptions and other disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic and general global economic conditions. The cost of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, labor and shipping and transportation
has increased considerably. We expect higher than recent years levels of inflation to persist for the foreseeable future. If we
are unable to fully offset higher costs through price increases or other measures, we could experience an adverse impact to our business,
prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Interest rates have also increased considerably. The increase in
inflation and interest rates impacts the demand for our EVs, as customers may delay purchasing and/or have difficulty financing their
purchases. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any
financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative
contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholder s equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated
financial statements. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves
as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

We currently conduct our business
operations in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Greece, Italy and Australia. The functional currency of our Company and our subsidiaries located
in the United States is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our subsidiaries located in Europe and Australia are the Euro and
AUD, respectively. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are re-measured into the functional currency at the rates of exchange
prevailing when the transactions occur. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-measured into the functional
currency at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates. Exchange gains and losses are included in our consolidated statements
of operations. 

Our reporting currency is
the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, are translated into the U.S.
dollar using exchange rates in effect at each period end, and revenues and expenses are translated into the U.S. dollar at average rates
prevailing during the year. Gains and losses resulting from the translations of the financial statements of these subsidiaries into the
U.S. dollar are recognized as other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Depending on movements in
foreign exchange rates, the foreign currency exchange may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. In 2021 and
2022, we recorded foreign currency exchange gain of 2.7 million and 2.6 million in our consolidated statements of operations, respectively. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Our exposure to interest rate
risk primarily relates to interest expenses incurred on our short-term and long-term borrowings, as well as interest income generated
from excess cash invested in demand deposits. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not used
any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being
exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. However, our future interest expense may increase due to changes in market
interest rates. If market interest rates for short-term demand deposits increase in the near future, such increase may cause the amount
of our interest income to rise. A hypothetical 10 increase in the average interest rate for our bank borrowings would result in an increase
of approximately 0.5 million and 0.2 million in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. We may use derivative
financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate potential risks of interest expense increases due to changes in market
interest rates.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this annual
report, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based upon this evaluation, our management has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our existing disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective because of the material weaknesses
described below under Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. We have undertaken
the remedial steps to address the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures as set forth below under Management s
Plan for Remediation of Material Weaknesses. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of a company s assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that a company s receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of a company s management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company s assets that could have
a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

102 

Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our company s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, we noted the following
deficiencies that we believe to be material weaknesses: 

a. 
 Failure to maintain an effective control environment of internal control over financial reporting; 

b. 
 Failure to develop an effective risk assessment process to identify and evaluate at a sufficient level of detail all relevant risks of material misstatement, including business, operational, and fraud risks; 

c. 
 Ineffective monitoring activities to assess the operation of internal control over financial reporting; 

d. 
 Ineffective process-level controls associated with the revenue, purchasing and inventory, treasury, property and equipment, tax, and payroll processes that (a) addressed relevant risks, (b) provided sufficient evidence of performance, and (c) established appropriate segregation of duties, during the financial reporting processes; 

e. 
 Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented for financial information processing and reporting and lacked resources with requisite skills for the financial reporting under U.S. GAAP; and 

f. 
 Lack of sufficient controls designed and implemented in IT environment and IT general control activities, which mainly associated with areas of logical access security, system change, computer operation and service organization control monitoring activities. Certain process-level automated controls and manual controls that are dependent on the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected information technology systems were also ineffective. 

As a result of the above
material weaknesses, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022. 

Management s Plan for Remediation of
Material Weaknesses 

Our management has been engaged
in, and continues to be engaged in making necessary changes and improvements to the overall design of its control environment to address
the material weaknesses, significant deficiencies and control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting and the ineffectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and of internal control over financial reporting described above. 

To remediate the material
weaknesses described above, we plan to continue to establish a comprehensive and effective internal control system with the assistance
from third party consulting firm which shall provide relevant professional advisory services to us. We plan to continue to assess our
standardized processes to further enhance the effectiveness of our financial review, including the analysis and monitoring of financial
information in a consistent and thorough manner. The Company s remediation actions to be taken were highlighted as follows: 

a. 
 Strengthen overview and monitoring from the Company s governance, and set up the Company s internal audit department who reports to the audit committee directly, to ensure enhanced oversight over the Company s financial reporting function; 

b. 
 Engage a professional adviser to review, test and optimize the Company s internal control system, particularly focusing on the material weaknesses identified as above. 

103 

c. 
 Launch and improve the internal control execution plan to supervise and monitor the operational functions; 

d. 
 Establish a formal and systematic risk assessment program and involve upper management to identify and analyze risks. 

e. 
 Provide our accounting team and other relevant personnel with more comprehensive guidelines and training on the policies and controls over financial reporting under U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and requirements

of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. See Item 3. Key Information-D.

Family Relationships 

There are no family relationships among our executive
officers, directors and significant employees. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

To the best of our knowledge,
there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees material
to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter or control person of our Company during the
past ten years. 

106 

Board of Directors 

Our board of directors currently
consists of five directors, three of whom satisfy the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and
Rule 5605 of the NASDAQ Rules. The Board of Directors has determined that Maurice Ngai, Qing Lu and Jing Zhang are independent under Rule
5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Rules. 

A director is not required
to hold any shares in the Company by way of qualification. A director who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in
a contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction with our company must declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of
the directors. Subject to the NASDAQ Rules and disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in
respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding that he or she may be interested therein and
if he or she does so his or her vote shall be counted and he or she may be counted in the quorum at the relevant board meeting at which
such contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction is considered. Our board of directors may exercise all of the powers
of our Company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge our undertakings, property and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or other
securities whenever money is borrowed or pledged as security for any debt, liability or obligation of our Company or of any third party. 

Board Operations 

One person holds the positions
of principal executive officer and chairman of the Board of Company. The Board has not designated a lead director. Given the limited number
of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between board
meetings, communicate with management and one another directly. In the circumstances, the directors believe that formalizing in a lead
director functions in which they all participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors.
The Chairman of the Board chairs Board and stockholder meetings and participates in preparing their agendas. The Chairman of the Board
also serves as a focal point for communication between management and the Board between Board meetings, although there is no restriction
on communication between directors and management. The Company believes that these arrangements afford the directors sufficient resources
to supervise management effectively, without being overly engaged in day-to-day operations. 

The Board plays an active
role, as well as the independent committees, in overseeing the management of the Company s risks. The Board regularly reviews reports
from members of senior management and committees on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, strategic
and regulatory risks. 

The Board of Directors held
10 meetings during 2022. During 2022, no director attended fewer than 75 of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees
of which the director was a member.

in good faith to be in our best interests. Our directors also have a duty to exercise the skill they actually possess and such care and
diligence that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. In fulfilling their duty of care to us, our directors
must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time. Our Company has the
right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. 

Terms of Directors and Executive Officers 

The members of the Board serve
until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. Our officers are appointed by and serve at the discretion of the board of

composition with his creditors; (ii) dies or is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind; (iii) resigns his office by written
notice to the Company; (iv) the board resolves that his office be vacated; or (v) is removed from office pursuant to any other provision
of our memorandum and articles of association. 

Material Changes to the Procedures by which

procedure by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board.

Stock Incentive Plans 

2006 Equity Incentive Plan 

On November 15, 2006, SPI s
board of directors adopted the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, reserving nine percent (9 of the outstanding shares of SPI s common
stock for the plan, and this plan was approved by SPI s shareholders on February 7, 2007. Upon completion of the Redomicle Merger,
our Company assumed SPI s existing obligations under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and an equal number of the Company s ordinary
shares, rather than the common stock of SPI, will be issued upon the exercise of the awards under this plan. 

The following are principal
terms under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan: 

Administration. The
administrator is a committee consisting of two or more independent members of the Board appointed by the Board to administer this plan,
or if there is no such committee, the Board itself. 

Awards . We may grant
incentive and non-qualified share options, restricted shares, unrestricted shares and share appreciation rights under this plan. 

Award Agreements. Each
award granted under this plan will be evidenced by a signed written award agreement between the Company and the award recipient. 

113 

Exercise Price. The
exercise price of any option or share appreciation right will be determined by the administrator in accordance with this plan. 

Terms of Awards. The
term of options granted under this plan may not exceed ten years (or five years, in the case of an incentive share option granted to an
optionee who owns more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of share of the Company). The term of a share
appreciation right will be set forth in the award agreement as determined by the administrator. 

Vesting Schedule. The
administrator may determine in its discretion whether any award will be subject to vesting and the terms and conditions of any such vesting.
The award agreement will contain any such vesting schedule. 

Transfer Restrictions.
 No options, restricted shares awards (prior to vesting, subject to the plan and the award agreement) or share appreciation rights
may be transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution, except that non-qualified options and share appreciation
rights may be transferred to an award recipient s former spouse pursuant to a property settlement made part of an agreement or court
order incident to the divorce. During the lifetime of an award recipient, only the award recipient, his guardian or legal representative
may exercise an option (other than an incentive share option) pursuant to a domestic relations order in accordance with the plan. During
the lifetime of an award recipient, only the award recipient may exercise the restricted share awards or share appreciation rights. 

Termination of Employment
or Service. In the event that an award recipient terminates employment with us or ceases to provide services to us, an award may be
exercised following the termination of employment or services as provided in the plan and the award agreement. 

Termination and Amendment
of the Plan. This plan was assumed in 2016. Our Board has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the plan, subject to shareholder
approval with respect to certain amendments. No award will be granted after termination of this plan but all awards granted prior to termination
will remain in effect in accordance with their terms. 

2015 Equity Incentive Plan 

On May 8, 2015, our board
of directors adopted our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. Our shareholders approved this plan on the same date. This plan went effective upon

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

The amount due from related
parties of 332 thousands and 230 thousands as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represented expense paid by the Company
on behalf of a related party. 

Related Party Policy 

Our Audit Committee has adopted an internal policy
regarding the identification, review, consideration and oversight of any transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar
transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we and any related party are participants. Transactions involving
compensation for services provided to us as an employee, director, consultant or similar capacity by a related person are not covered.
A related party is any executive officer, director or a holder of more than five percent of our ordinary shares, including any of their
immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. 

Under our policy, where a transaction has been
identified as a related party transaction, management must present information regarding the proposed related party transaction to the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors for review. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material
facts, the direct and indirect interests of the related parties, the benefits of the transaction to us and whether any alternative transactions
are available. To identify related party transactions in advance, we rely on information supplied by our executive officers, directors
and certain significant shareholders. In considering related party transactions, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors takes into
account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to the risks, costs and benefits to us; the impact on
a director s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with
which a director is affiliated; the terms of the transaction; the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and
the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from our employees generally. In the event a director
has an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must excuse himself or herself from the deliberations and approval. 

Director Independence 

The Board has determined that Maurice Ngai, Qing
Lu and Jing Zhang are independent under the current independence standards of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of
The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and meet the criteria set forth in Rule 10A(m)(3) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended

_________________ 

(1) 
 Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit and review of our financial statements and services that are normally provided by the above auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory fillings or engagements. 

(2) 
 Audit related fees consist of assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of audit or review of our financial statements related to our SEC filings. 

Consistent with the rules
of the SEC regarding auditor independence, our Board of Directors is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the
work of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Board asks our independent registered public accounting firm to provide
a detailed description of its services each year as a basis for its decision-making. The Board evaluates the proposals based on four categories:
audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services; and determines the proper arrangement for each service according
to its judgment as to our needs over the coming year. Our Board pre-approves all audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent
registered public accounting firm. The Board pre-approved 100 of the audit and audit-related services performed by the independent registered
public accounting firms described above in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. 

Pre-Approval of Services 

In accordance with the SEC s
auditor independence rules, the Audit Committee has established the following policies and procedures by which it approves in advance
any audit or permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Company by its independent auditor. 

Prior to the engagement of
the independent auditor for any fiscal year s audit, management submits to the Audit Committee for approval lists of recurring audit,
audit-related, tax and other services expected to be provided by the auditor during that fiscal year. The Audit Committee adopts pre-approval
schedules describing the recurring services that it has pre-approved, and is informed on a timely basis, and in any event by the next
scheduled meeting, of any such services rendered by the independent auditor and the related fees. 

The fees for any services
listed in a pre-approval schedule are budgeted, and the Audit Committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual
fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year. The Audit Committee will require additional pre-approval if circumstances arise
where it becomes necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services above the amount of fees originally pre-approved.
Any audit or non-audit service not listed in a pre-approval schedule must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case
basis. Every request to adopt or amend a pre-approval schedule or to provide services that are not listed in a pre-approval schedule must
include a statement by the independent auditors as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the SEC s rules on
auditor independence. 

119 

The Audit Committee will not grant approval for: 

any services prohibited by applicable law or by any rule or regulation of the SEC or other regulatory body applicable to the Company; 

provision by the independent auditor to the Company of strategic consulting services of the type typically provided by management consulting firms; or 

the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the tax treatment of which may not be clear under the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and which it is reasonable to conclude will be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the Company s financial statements. 

Tax services proposed to be provided by the auditor
to any director, officer or employee of the Company who is in an accounting role or financial reporting oversight role must be approved
by the Audit Committee on a case-by-case basis where such services are to be paid for by the Company, and the Audit Committee will be
informed of any services to be provided to such individuals that are not to be paid for by the Company. 

In determining whether to grant pre-approval of
any non-audit services in the all other category, the Audit Committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances,
including the following four basic guidelines : 

whether the service creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and the Company; 

whether the service places the auditor in the position of auditing his or her own work; 

whether the service results in the auditor acting as management or an employee of the Company; and 

whether the service places the auditor in a position of being an advocate for the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 SPI Energy Co., Ltd. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of SPI Energy Co., Ltd. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive loss, equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has a significant
working capital deficit, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Convertible Bonds and Derivative liability 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

As described in Note
14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the redemption feature of the Company s outstanding convertible bonds
issued to Streeterville Capital, LLC was modified to be that the redemption conversion price would be 80 of the lowest closing trade
price in the 10 trading days immediately preceding the applicable redemption date and the Company determines that this modified redemption
feature meets the definition of a derivative and the Company estimates a fair value of the derivative liability using the Monte Carlo
Simulation. 

We identified the accounting
of the Company s convertible bonds and derivative liability as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required
in determining the liability component of the related convertible bonds as well as the balance sheet classification of the elements of
these convertible bonds. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit
effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our principal audit procedures included, among
others: 

evaluating relevant contract terms and conditions of the convertible notes agreements in relation to the appropriate accounting literature; 

involving personnel with specialized knowledge in valuation to review the valuation of the derivative liability in convertible bonds made by the Company; 

evaluating the management s assessment on the accounting treatment; 

assessing the adequacy of the Company s disclosures included in Note 11 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Impairment of long-lived assets 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

Long-lived assets, primarily, property
and equipment, project assets, intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets, comprise a significant amount of the Company s
total assets. The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying
amount is not recoverable in the amount that equals to the excess of their carrying value over the fair value. 

As described in Note 7 and Note 21 to
the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company identified indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and recorded
total impairment charges of 1.6 million for right-of-use assets in its renewable energy solutions segment and 0.4 million for its project
assets in its solar projects development segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management applied significant judgment in estimating
the undiscounted cash flow of future revenues and costs derived from roofing and solar energy systems installation and solar projects
development and the determination of the fair value . These forecasts require assumptions about
the demand for its products and services, future market conditions and regulatory developments. 

F- 3 

We identified impairment of long-lived
assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to estimate the recoverable amount
 and fair value of long-lived assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an
increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of Management s estimates and assumptions
related to forecasts of future undiscounted cash flows, and assessing the audit evidence is also complex. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our principal audit procedures included, among
others: 

evaluating the Company s impairment assessment methodology; 

assessing the reasonableness of Management s forecasts by testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data, and evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the management s forecasts; 

assessing the adequacy of the Company s impairment disclosures included in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2017, the Group deconsolidated
one of the major subsidiaries, Sinsin Renewable Investment Limited Sinsin due to loss of control and recognized the investment
in Sinsin at the carrying amount of . Both the Group and the former shareholders of Sinsin, Sinsin Europe Solar Asset Limited Partnership
and Sinsin Solar Capital Limited Partnership (collectively, the Sinsin Group ), failed to fulfill the obligation under the
share sale and purchase agreement of Sinsin, which led to that both parties filed petitions to each other. The petitions directly affected
the Group s ability to effectively control Sinsin and make any direct management decisions or have any direct impact on Sinsin s
polices, operations or assets without the agreement of Sinsin Group. On October 29, 2020, an arbitration decision was made in Malta that
the Group will need to pay the unpaid consideration of EUR 38,054, together with interest at 6 accruing from November 20, 2015 on half
of the unpaid consideration and from June 30, 2016 on the remaining half of the unpaid consideration to the date of eventual payment.
The Group filed an application for appeals but was turned down by the court of Malta on November 12, 2021. The Group furtherly filed an
application of retrial and suspension of the enforcement of the awards but was rejected by the court of Malta on March 30, 2022. On November
2, 2022, Sinsin filed an action to confirm these arbitral awards pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958 New York Convention as implemented by the Federal Arbitration Act FAA before U.S. District Court Eastern District of California, and the management is in progress of negotiation with Sinsin to achieve a settlement
to suspend the enforcement of the arbitration decision (Note 22(b)). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, investment in Sinsin was ,
and there was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Consideration payable, including accrued interest and litigation
fees payable, was and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The interest expense accrued on the unpaid consideration
was and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

On June 10, 2022, Phoenix Motor Inc. Phoenix ), the parent company of Phoenix Cars LLC and Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC, completed its initial public offering IPO and Phoenix s shares have been listed on NASDAQ under the stock code PEV Phoenix IPO ).
Phoenix issued ordinary shares at per share. Net proceeds from the Phoenix IPO after deducting underwriting commissions,
share issuance costs and offering expenses amounted to . 

 during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Group had
a working capital deficit of and the cash flow used in the operation activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was .
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

For the next 12 months from the issuance
date of these consolidated financial statements, the Group plans to continue implementing various measures to boost revenue and control
the cost and expenses within an acceptable level. Such measures include: 1) negotiate with potential buyers on PV solar projects; 2) negotiate
for postponing of convertible bond payments; 3) improve the profitability of the business in the United States; 4) proactively implement
a robust capital market strategy that includes both debt and equity offerings to meet the Group s financing needs; 5) strictly control
and reduce business, marketing and advertising expenses and 6) seek for certain credit facilities. 

There is no assurance that the plans will be successfully implemented. If the Group
fails to achieve these goals, the Group may need additional financing to repay debt obligations and execute its business plan, and the
Group may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that
financing sources are not available, or that the Group is unsuccessful in increasing its gross profit margin and reducing operating losses,
the Group may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any
of which would have a material adverse effect on the Group s business, financial condition and results of operations and may materially
adversely affect its ability to continue as a going concern. 

The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Group be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among
other things, the Group s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements
to support its working capital requirements. 

The Group uses quoted market prices
to determine the fair value when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the Group measures fair value using valuation techniques
that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates. 

 cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

 ,
including: 1) 
restricted cash mainly established to secure the loan from East West Bank and pay the obligations of SJ Australia for debtor
financing; 2) 
restricted cash subject to a requirement of initial project contribution from Oahu SPE 101-1 LLC; 3) 
restricted cash was established to secure the loan from Santander Bank; 4) 
non-current restricted cash was established to guarantee on Piraeus Bank for projects in Greece and 5) 
non-current restricted cash deposited in an escrow account for the Phoenix IPO. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Group
had restricted bank deposits of , including: 1) restricted cash mainly established to secure the loan from East West Bank
and to pay the obligations of SJ Australia for debtor financing; 2) restricted cash subject a requirement of initial project contribution
from Oahu SPE 101-1 LLC that has not been met yet. 

The solar systems held for
development and sale, named as project assets , are reported as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets when
upon completion of the construction of the solar systems, the Group initiates a plan to actively market the project assets for
immediate sale in their present condition to potential third party buyers subject to terms that are usual and customary for sales of
these types of assets and it is probable that the project assets will be sold within one year. Otherwise, the project assets are
reported as noncurrent assets. No depreciation expense is recognized while the project assets are under construction or classified
as held for sale. 

For solar systems held for development
and sale, named as project assets , the Group considers a project commercially viable if it is anticipated to be sold for
a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed. The Group also considers a partially developed or partially constructed
project commercially viable if the anticipated selling price is higher than the carrying value of the related project assets plus the
estimated cost to completion. The Group considers a number of factors, including changes in environmental, ecological, permitting, market
pricing or regulatory conditions that affect the project. Such changes may cause the cost of the project to increase or the selling price
of the project to decrease. The Group records an impairment loss of the project asset to the extent the carrying value exceed its estimated
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is estimated based on the anticipated sales proceeds reduced by estimated cost to complete
such sales. Subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is recognized. 

If the Group s intended use of
solar systems changed from held for development and sale within project assets to held for use within property and
equipment , the solar systems should be measured in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-44 at the lower of (1) its carrying amount before
the asset was classified as held for development and sale, adjusted for any depreciation or amortization expense that would have been
recognized had the assets continued to be classified as held for use, or (2) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not
to sell. Any adjustment to the carrying amount based on reclassifying the solar systems to held for use within property and equipment 
should be reflected in the income statement within continuing operations in the period the decision is made not to sell.

The Group recognizes in the consolidated
financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based
on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold,
management presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to
be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent
likely of being realized upon settlement. The Group s tax liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically
due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of the tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments
are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Group records interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax
position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. No reserve for uncertainty
tax position was recorded by the Group for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Group does not expect that the assessment
regarding unrecognized tax positions will materially change over the next 12 months. The Group is not currently under examination by an
income tax authority, nor have been notified that an examination is contemplated. 

For both solar energy system installation
and roofing, all costs to obtain and fulfill contracts associated with system sales and other product sales are expensed to cost of revenue
when the corresponding revenue is recognized. 

The Group recognizes revenue using
a cost-based input method that recognizes revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs
incurred compared to the total estimated cost of the contract, to determine the Group s progress towards contract completion and
to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and gross profit to recognize. The total estimated cost of the contract constitutes of
material cost and labor cost, and are developed based on the size and specific situation of different jobs. Changes in estimates mainly
due to: (i) unforeseen field conditions that impacts the estimated workload, and (ii) change of the unit price of material or labor cost. 

If the estimated total costs on any
contract are greater than the net contract revenues, the Group recognizes the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known. 

Electricity revenue with PPAs 

The Group sells energy generated by
PV solar power systems under PPAs. For energy sold under PPAs, the Group recognizes revenue each period based on the volume of energy
delivered to the customer (i.e., the PPAs off-taker) and the price stated in the PPAs. The Group has determined that none of the PPAs
contains a lease since (i) the purchaser does not have the rights to operate the PV solar power systems, (ii) the purchaser does not have
the rights to control physical access to the PV solar power systems, and (iii) the price that the purchaser pays is at a fixed price per
unit of output. 

Sale of PV project asset 

The Group s sales arrangements
for PV projects do not contain any forms of continuing involvement that may affect the revenue or profit recognition of the transactions,
nor any variable considerations for energy performance guarantees, minimum electricity end subscription commitments. The Group therefore
determined its single performance obligation to the customer is the sale of a completed solar project. The Group recognizes revenue for
sales of solar projects at a point in time after the solar project has been grid connected and the customer obtains control of the solar
project. 

Revenue from sales and leasing of EV 

The Group recognizes revenue from sales
of EV at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon the delivery
to the customer for EV sales. The Group determined that the government grants related to sales of EV should be considered as part of the
transaction price because it is granted to the EV buyer and the buyer remains liable for such amount in the event the grants were not
received by the Group or returned due to the buyer violates the government grant terms and conditions. 

EV leasing revenue includes revenue
recognized under lease accounting guidance for direct leasing programs. The Group accounts for these leasing transactions as operating
leases under ASC 842 Leases, and revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term. 

Other revenue 

Other revenue mainly consist of sales
of self-assembled solar modules, sales of component and charging stations, sales of forklifts, engineering and maintenance service, shipping
and delivery service, sales of pre-development solar projects and others. Other revenues are recognized at a point in time following the
transfer of control of such service or products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment of product or acceptance of the
customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.

The following table provides information

Contract assets 

Advance from customers 

The contract assets primarily relate
to the Group s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date, primarily for the revenue from roofing
and solar energy systems installation in the United States. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become
unconditional after billing is issued. 

Advance from customers, which representing
a contract liability, represents mostly unrecognized revenue amount received from customers. Advance from customers is recognized as (or
when) the Group performs under the contract. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Group recognized and 
as revenue that was included in the balance of advance from customers at January 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

balances of government grants received were included in deferred income with amount of and , respectively. 

and as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Product Warranty for products
used in roofing and solar energy systems installation 

The Group purchases products like panels
and batteries from third-party manufacturers, sometimes with its Solar4America label and delivers the products together
with its installation service. The Group receives product warranty from the manufactures and transfers the product warranty to the clients
in the builder or home improvement contracts. The product manufacturers will service their warranties by repairing or replacing the products.
The workmanship warranty does not include the product warranties (panels and inverters) which are covered directly by the manufacturers. 

Product Warranty for vehicles
or components 

The Group provides warranties on all
vehicles or components sold in addition to pass through warranties from third party component suppliers. The Group accrues a warranty
reserve for the products sold by the Group, which includes the Group s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace
items under warranties. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs
of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given the Group s relatively short history of sales, and changes to the
Group s historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The Group
considers the warranty provided is not providing incremental service to customers rather an assurance to the quality of the vehicle, and
therefore is not a separate performance obligation and should be accounted for in accordance with ASC 460 - Guarantees. Warranty expense
is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The balance of warranty reserves for vehicles
or components was and as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

and potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation
as their effects are anti-dilutive, respectively. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU
2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ASU 2020-04 ),
which provides elective amendments for entities that have contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR
or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. These amendments were effective immediately and
may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December
31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), to expand and clarify the scope of Topic 848
to include derivative instruments on discounting transactions. The amendments in this ASU are effective in the same timeframe as ASU 2020-04.
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which deferred
the sunset date of Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform to December 31, 2024. The Group is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will
have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU
2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ASU
2021-08 ), which requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination
in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). The update will generally result in an entity
recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the
acquisition date rather than at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Group will adopt ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2023 and apply the guidance to subsequent
acquisitions. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 will only impact the accounting for the Group s future acquisitions. 

The Group does not believe other recently
issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheets,
statements of operations and cash flows.

PDI factored as of the acquisition date. SJ US is responsible to settle the remaining part of the facility if the collection of the factored
accounts receivable is not able to cover the loan balance, and if there is any excess amount on the factored accounts receivable after
the LSQ loan is fully repaid, remaining factored accounts receivable will be released to SJ US. The cash consideration has been fully
paid as of December 31, 2021. The acquisition is accounted as an asset acquisition according to ASC 805 since the assets purchased does
not meet the definition of a business.

The customer relationship was mainly
contributed by the acquisition of SJ Australia in May 2015 and assets purchased from PDI in February 2021 (see Note 4). The customer relationship
with clients of SJ Australia was the key driver of the revenue, which was expected to bring further economic benefit to the Group s
business, the balance of customer relationship for SJ Australia is amortized over the useful life of 10 years. 

The customer relationship for SJ US
mainly represented the customer contracts in process, the Company could continue the execution of the contracts to generate profit by
inputting material and labor cost. As of December 31, 2022, all the contracts in process purchased have either been executed or forfeited,
and the cost has been fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The tradename and technology were contributed
by the acquisition of Phoenix in the year of 2020. As tradename and technology were the key drivers of the revenue for Phoenix, which
were expected to bring further economic benefit to the Group s business, the tradename and technology were separately identified

LLC Streeterville with an aggregate principal amount of (the 2021 Note ). On April 8, 2022, the Group
 entered into a convertible promissory note purchase agreement with Streeterville with an initial principal amount of 
(the 2022 Note ). Both 2021 Note and 2022 Note had a 12-month term and carried interest at per annum. The Group s
obligations under the 2021 Note and 2022 Note may be prepaid at any time, provided that in such circumstance the Group would pay 115 
of any amounts outstanding under the note. The note could be convertible into shares of the Group s ordinary share
at a conversion price of 20 per share at any time after the issuance date. 

Streeterville could redeem any portion
of the note, at any time after six months from the issue date, subject to a maximum monthly redemption amount of 700 for 2021 Note and
 350 for 2022 Note, the Group have the option to pay such redemptions in cash or the Company s ordinary shares at the redemption
conversion price, or by a combination thereof. The Group shall be required to pay the redemption amount in cash, if on the applicable
redemption Date: (a) there is an Equity Conditions Failure, and such failure is not waived in writing by Lender; or (b) the closing trade
price on the trading day immediately preceding the redemption date was less than 25.00 per share. Equity
Conditions Failure means that any of the following conditions has not been satisfied on any given Redemption Date: (a) with respect
to the applicable date of determination all of the conversion shares would be freely tradable under Rule 144 or without the need for registration
under any applicable federal or state securities laws (in each case, disregarding any limitation on conversion of this Note); (b) no event
of default shall have occurred or be continuing hereunder; (c) the average and median daily dollar volume of the ordinary shares on its
principal market for the previous twenty and two hundred trading days shall be greater than 75; and (d) the market capitalization is
greater than or equal to 30,000. 

The Group issued ordinary
shares of the Company to settle 2021 Note, which was considered as extinguishment of convertible bonds and the loss on extinguishment
of convertible bonds of and nil were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

On October 28, 2022, the Group made
an amendment to the 2021 Note to extend the maturity for an additional 1 year from the original maturity date for each of the remaining
2021 Note, the extension fee equal to two percent of the outstanding balances of the Note as of June 9, 2022, September 30, 2022 and November
12, 2022, which equal , and , respectively. Besides, the Group made an amendment to the 2021 Note for the term of redemption
conversion price. The modified Redemption Conversion Price should be the 80 of the lowest closing trade price in the 10 trading days
immediately preceding the applicable redemption date. The redemption conversion price for the 2022 Note should be the lesser of 20 and
80 multiplied by the lowest closing trade price during the ten trading days immediately preceding the redemption date. 

The Group deems the two amendments
to the 2021 Note are substantively one amendment and evaluated the amendment in accordance with ASC 470, Debt ASC 470 ).
As the effective borrowing rate under the restructured agreement is less than the effective borrowing rate on the old agreement and as
a concession is deemed to have been granted under ASC 470-60-55-10, the amendment is to be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring
under ASC 470-60. For the extension fee, as the extension fee is not incurred in granting equity interests and there is no gain recognized
on restructuring because carrying amount of the payable is not larger than total undiscounted future cash flows, the extension fee was
expensed for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The Group determines that the redemption
feature embedded within the amended 2021 Note meets the definition of an embedded derivative and the Group estimates a fair value of the
derivative liability using the Mento Carlo Simulation Model at the date of amendment. As the fair value of the derivative liability is
less than the face value of the convertible debt, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting
amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. 

The Group issued ordinary shares
of the Company to redeem the amended 2021 Note, and reclassified 184 derivative liability into equity upon the redemption of the corresponding
convertible debts. 

The Group recorded a total of 
debt discount upon the amendment of 2021 Note. Amortization of the debt discount of 2021 Note was for the year ended December 31,
2022. The debt discount is amortized under effective interest rate for 2021 Note.

debt discount upon the issuance of 2022 Note, including of direct transaction costs incurred, and original debt discount at issuance.
Amortization of the debt discount of 2022 Note was for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
carrying amounts of the Group s convertible bonds are and , net of unamortized debt discount of and ,
respectively.

As share-based compensation expense

forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

Determining Fair Value 

Valuation and Amortization Method
 The Group estimates the fair value of service-based options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula. The fair
value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. 

Expected Term The Group s
expected term represents the period that the Group s share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. For awards granted subject
only to service vesting requirements, the Group utilizes the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the share-based award,
instead of historical exercise data. 

Expected Volatility The
Group uses historical volatility of the price of its ordinary shares to calculate the volatility for its granted options. 

Expected Dividend The
Group has never paid dividends on its ordinary shares and currently does not intend to do so, and accordingly, the dividend yield percentage
is zero for all periods. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate 
The Group bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model upon the implied yield curve currently available
on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issued with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the assumption in the model.

As of December 31, 2022, the
Group had a net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes of approximately .
Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, 
begin to expire from the year 2027 to 2037. The remaining 
of federal net operating loss carryforwards, which are limited to 80 of taxable income rather than the historical 100 , do not
expire. The Group had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately ,
which will begin to expire in the year 2026 to 2042. The Group has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of .
The Group has a federal R D credit of ,
which will begin to expire from the year 2041 to 2042. The Group has a California R D credit of , which will never
expire. 

Utilization of the federal and state
net operating losses may be subject to certain annual limitations under IRC Section 382 due to the change in ownership provisions.
The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. The Group has a full valuation
allowance against US federal and state net operating losses. 

The Group recognizes deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized. Management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for
recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income in assessing the need for
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Realization of the Group s deferred tax
assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Because of the Group s lack of earnings
history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance in the U.S. The valuation allowance increased by
 and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The Group had unrecognized tax benefits
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Group currently files income tax returns in the U.S., as well as California, Hawaii,
New Jersey, and certain other foreign jurisdictions. The Group is currently not the subject of any income tax examinations. The Group s
tax returns generally remain open for tax years after 2012. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy
Security (CARES) Act the CARES Act, H.R. 748 was signed into law on 27 March 2020. The CARES Act temporarily eliminates
the 80 taxable income limitation (as enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) for NOL deductions for 2018-2020 tax years and
reinstated NOL carrybacks for the 2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also temporarily increases the business interest deduction
limitations from 30 to 50 of adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable year. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies
qualified improvement property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus depreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively
as if it was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
included a sunset provision such that Research and Experimental Expenses incurred after December 31, 2021 are capitalized and
amortized. US R E expenses are amortized over five years and non-US R E expenses are amortized over fifteen years. As
part of the December 31, 2022 tax provision calculation, the Group added back to taxable income, research expenditures of .
These expenses were incurred in the U.S. and amortized over years
for U.S. tax purposes.

In July 2022, the Group made a decision
that SJ US would pause its roofing and solar energy system installation business in the states of Florida, Texas, Nevada and Colorado,
due to insufficient business volume and profitability in those four states. In August 2022, the Group provided its notice to terminate
the leases for its offices in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Texas to the respective landlords. The total lease termination costs for these
four locations were about , which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company derecognized of right of use assets and of lease liabilities as of the date of
early termination. In accordance with the termination, the Company was released from all future rights and obligations under the lease. 

Right-of-use assets, along with other
long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
or asset group may not be recoverable. In 2022, the Group identified indicators of impairment for long-lived assets held by SJ US due
to gross loss generated from roofing and solar energy systems installation business. For right-of-use assets held by SJ US, the Group
performed a recoverability test, comparing estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related long-lived assets within
the asset group and considered that the carrying amount is not recoverable. The Group recorded an impairment charge of , for impairment
of its right-of-use assets in its renewable energy solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. These charges were recorded
in impairment charges on long-lived assets in the Group s consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31,
2021, there were impairment charges recorded related to long-lived assets. 

Maturities of operating lease liabilities

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of years and years, respectively, and a weighted average discount
rate of and , respectively. 

 . These commitments were solely related to contracts signed with vendors for research and development
by the Group and are expected to be paid in one year. 

(b) 
 Contingencies 

On January 26, 2018, Sinsin Group filed
a complaint against the Group requesting the payment of outstanding purchase price and related interest of 43,595 (EUR 38,054). On June
25, 2018, an interim measures judgment was made which appointed an interim management of Sinsin, consisting of two members elected by
Sinsin Group and one member elected by the Group. The interim management would manage the bank accounts of Sinsin and collect the proceeds
of electric energy revenue. On October 29, 2020, an arbitration decision was made that the Group will need to pay the outstanding purchase
price of 43,595 (EUR 38,054), together with interest at 6 accruing from November 20, 2015 on half of the outstanding purchase and from
June 30, 2016 on the remaining half of the outstanding purchase price to the date of eventual payment. The Group filed an application
for appeals in the court of Malta but was turned down by the court of Malta in November 2021. The Group furtherly filed an application
of retrial and suspension of the enforcement of the awards. The application of retrial was rejected by the court of Malta on March 30,
2022. On November 2, 2022, Sinsin filed an action to confirm these arbitral awards pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958 New York Convention as implemented by the Federal Arbitration Act FAA before U.S. District Court Eastern District of California, and the management is in progress of negotiation with Sinsin to achieve a settlement
to suspend the enforcement of the arbitration decision. On April 11, 2023, Sinsin filed a motion seeking leave to amend its petition to
add a request for an award of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the petition, add detail on the allegedly owed costs and
liabilities, and request that the court issue an injunction against asset dissipation pending satisfaction of the requested judgment.
The Group will be opposing the motion for leave to amend, and the hearing is set for May 18, 2023. 

On February 16, 2023, Streeterville delivered
a Redemption Notice to the Group to redeem 350 of the 2022 Note with a deadline to pay the Redemption Amount by February 22, 2023 (See
Note 14 and Note 26). The Group failed to pay the Redemption Amount on time and such failure to pay is an Event of Default under the 2022
Note. Due to this Event of Default, (i) the base interest of the 2022 Note was increased to 15 per annum; (ii) the outstanding balance
of the 2022 Note was increased by 15 ; and (iii) the entire outstanding balance of the 2022 Note was accelerated and due on March 3, 2023.
The Group failed to pay the outstanding balance of the 2022 Note by March 3, 2023 and as a result, Streeterville filed a complaint in
the third judicial district court of Salt Lake County, requesting for actual damages in an amount
not less than 2,676, plus applicable interest, damages, charges, fees, attorney fees, and collection costs. On March 31, 2023,
a hearing was held and the temporary restraining order requiring the Group to pay the 2022 Note
in full from the proceeds of the IPO of its subsidiary, SolarJuice Co., Ltd . 

From time to time, the Group is involved
in various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While the Group cannot predict the occurrence
or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, it does not believe that an adverse result in any pending legal or regulatory proceeding,
individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the Group s consolidated financial condition or cash flows; however, an unfavorable
outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Group s results of operations.

Authorized Share Capital 

SPI Energy is authorized to issue 5,000,000,000
shares of a par value of US 0.00001 each. The board of directors of SPI Energy is authorized to issue these shares in different classes
and series and, with respect to each class or series, to determine the designations, powers, preferences, privileges and other rights,

the powers and rights associated with the ordinary shares, at such times and on such other terms as they think proper. 

As of the date hereof, SPI Energy had 30,292,960
ordinary share issued and outstanding and no preference shares issued and outstanding.

and articles of association of SPI Energy, as amended and restated from time to time. Under Cayman Islands law, dividends may be declared
and paid only out of funds legally available therefor, namely out of either profit or share premium account, provided that a dividend

Register of Members 

Under Cayman Islands law, SPI Energy must keep
a register of members and there shall be entered therein: 

(a)

fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members shall be deemed as a matter
of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Upon the closing of this Redomicile
Merger, the register of members shall be immediately updated to reflect the issue of shares by SPI Energy that will underlie the ADSs.
Once SPI Energy s register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have
legal title to the shares set against their name in the register of members. 

1 

Voting Rights 

Each holder of ordinary shares is entitled to
one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote on a show of hands or, on a poll, each holder is entitled
to have one vote for each share registered in his name on the register of members. Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of
hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chairman of SPI Energy s board of directors or by any one or more
shareholders holding at least one-tenth of the paid-up shares given a right to vote at the meeting or one-tenth of the votes attaching
to the issued and outstanding ordinary shares in SPI Energy entitled to vote at general meetings, present in person or by proxy. 

A quorum required for a general meeting of shareholders
consists of one or more shareholders who hold in aggregate at least one-third of the votes attaching to the issued and outstanding ordinary
shares in SPI Energy entitled to vote at general meetings, present in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person,
by its duly authorized representative. Although not required by the Companies Laws or SPI Energy s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association, SPI Energy expects to hold shareholders meetings annually and such meetings may be convened by SPI
Energy s board of directors on its own initiative or upon a request to the directors by shareholders holding in aggregate at least
one-third of SPI Energy s shares that carry the right to vote at general meetings. Advance notice of at least 14 days is required
for the convening of SPI Energy s annual general meeting and other shareholders meetings. 

An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders
requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to the ordinary shares cast by those shareholders entitled to
vote who are present in person or by proxy in a general meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than
two-thirds of the votes attaching to the ordinary shares cast by those shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy
in a general meeting. 

Transfer of Ordinary Shares 

Subject to the restrictions of SPI Energy s
articles of association, as applicable, any of SPI Energy s shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by
an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by SPI Energy s board. 

SPI Energy s board of directors may, in
its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not fully paid up or on which SPI Energy have
a lien. SPI Energy s directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless: 

the instrument of transfer is lodged with SPI Energy, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as SPI Energy s board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 

the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares; 

the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required; 

in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the ordinary share is to be transferred does not exceed four; or 

the ordinary shares transferred are free of any lien in favor of SPI Energy. 

If SPI Energy s directors refuse to register
a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor
and the transferee notice of such refusal. The registration of transfers may, on 14 days notice being given by advertisement
in such one or more newspapers or by electronic means, be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as SPI
Energy s board of directors may from time to time determine; provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be
suspended and the register shall not be closed for more than 30 days in any year. 

Liquidation 

On a winding up of SPI Energy, if the assets available
for distribution among its shareholders shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the share capital at the commencement of the
winding up, the surplus will be distributed among its shareholders in proportion to the par value of the shares held by them at the commencement
of the winding up, subject to a deduction from those shares in respect of which there are monies due, of all monies payable to SPI Energy
for unpaid calls or otherwise. If SPI Energy s assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital,
the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by its shareholders in proportion to the par value of the shares held by them. 

2 

Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares 

SPI Energy s board of directors may from
time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their ordinary shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least

Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Ordinary Shares 

SPI Energy may issue shares on terms that are
subject to redemption, at SPI Energy s option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined
before the issue of such shares, by SPI Energy s board of directors or by a special resolution of SPI Energy s shareholders.
SPI Energy may also repurchase any of its shares provided that the manner and terms of such purchase have been approved by its board of
directors or are otherwise authorized by its memorandum and articles of association. Under the Companies Law, the redemption or repurchase
of any share may be paid out of SPI Energy s profits or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of such
redemption or repurchase, or out of capital (including share premium account and capital redemption reserve) if SPI Energy can, immediately
following such payment, pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the Companies Law no such
share may be redeemed or repurchased (a) unless it is fully paid up, (b) if such redemption or repurchase would result in there
being no shares outstanding, or (c) if the company has commenced liquidation. In addition, SPI Energy may accept the surrender of
any fully paid share for no consideration. 

Variations of Rights of Shares 

All or any of the special rights attached to any
class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, be varied either with the written consent of the holders of a majority
of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of an ordinary resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares
of that class. 

Inspection of Books and Records 

Holders of SPI Energy s ordinary shares
have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of SPI Energy s list of shareholders or its corporate
records. However, SPI Energy will provide its shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See Where You Can Find Additional
Information. 

Changes in Capital 

SPI Energy may from time to time by ordinary resolution: 

increase its share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such classes and amount, as the resolution shall prescribe; 

consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount than its existing shares; 

convert all or any of its paid up shares into stock and reconvert that stock into paid up shares of any denomination; 

sub-divide its existing shares, or any of them into shares of a smaller amount that is fixed by the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; and 

cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled. 

Subject to Companies Law and confirmation by the
Grand Court of the Cayman Islands on an application by SPI Energy for an order confirming such reduction, SPI Energy may by special resolution
reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve in any manner authorized by law. 

3 

Issuance of Additional Preferred Shares 

SPI Energy s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association authorizes SPI Energy s board of directors to issue additional ordinary shares from time to time as
its board of directors shall determine, to the extent of available authorized but unissued shares. 

SPI Energy s amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association authorizes SPI Energy s board of directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preferred
shares and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series, including: 

the designation of the series; 

the number of shares of the series; 

the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and 

the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. 

SPI Energy s board of directors may issue
preferred shares without action by its shareholders to the extent authorized but unissued. In addition, the issuance of preferred shares
may be used as an anti-takeover device without further action on the part of the shareholders. Issuance of these shares may dilute the
voting power of holders of ordinary shares. 

Exempted Company 

SPI Energy is an exempted company duly incorporated
with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies.
Any company, the objects of which are to conduct business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands, may apply to be registered as an exempted

privileges, including (a) an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies,
(b) an exempted company is not required to open its register of members for inspection, (c) an exempted company does not have
to hold an annual general meeting, (d) an exempted company may issue no par value, negotiable or bearer shares, and (e) an exempted
company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.
