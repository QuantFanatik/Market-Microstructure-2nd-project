Statement Regarding Fo rward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Annual Report contain forward-looking information as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that do not relate to historical or current facts or matters are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include all statements regarding our expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financing and refinancing plans, strategic and business plans, tenants, operators, projected expenses and capital expenditures, competitive position, growth and acquisition opportunities, and compliance with, and changes in, governmental regulations. You can identify some of the forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as anticipate, believe, plan, estimate, expect, intend, should, may and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 Our actual results may differ materially from those projected or contemplated by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, among others, the following: 
 The increased risks associated with our portfolio stabilization measures; 

Increases in market interest rates and inflation; 

Epidemics or pandemics including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related impact on our tenants, operators and healthcare facilities: 

Our ability to raise capital through equity and debt financings, and the cost of such capital; 

Our ability to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American LLC (the NYSE American and to maintain the listing of our securities thereon; 

Our dependence on the operating success of our tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us; 

Operational risks with respect to our Healthcare Services segment 

The effect of increasing healthcare regulation and enforcement on our tenants, and the dependence of our tenants on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors; 

The effect of our tenants potential financial or legal difficulties; 

The ability and willingness of our tenants to renew their leases with us upon expiration, and our ability to reposition our properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or if we otherwise need to replace an existing tenant; 

Our concentration in the healthcare property sector particularly in skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn in a specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries: 

The impact of liabilities associated with our legacy business of owning and operating healthcare properties, including pending and potential professional and general liability claims; 

The relatively illiquid nature of real estate investments 

The availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition opportunities, and our ability to complete such acquisitions and lease the respective properties on favorable terms; and 

Other risks inherent in the real estate business, including uninsured or underinsured losses affecting our properties, the possibility of environmental compliance costs and liabilities, and the illiquidity of real estate investments. 

We urge you to carefully consider these risks and review the additional disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements and our future business and operating results, including those made in Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors in this Annual Report, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.

PAR T I. 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 Description of Business 
 
 In this Annual Report except as the context suggests otherwise, the words Regional Health or Regional refer to Regional Health Properties, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and the words Company, we, ours and us refer to Regional Health and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Regional Health is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior housing. 
 
 Our primary business consists of acquiring and owning real estate property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. We primarily generate revenues by leasing properties to tenants and owning properties operated by third-party property managers throughout the United States U.S. ). In select circumstances, from time to time, in order to preserve the value of our assets, we may elect to take our facilities back from an operator and either hire a third-party manager or operate the facility ourselves until a new operator for the facility is secured. 
 
 We operate through two reportable segments: (i) real estate segment, which consists of owning and leasing/subleasing healthcare facilities, predominantly skilled nursing facilities SNFs and assisted living facilities ALFs ), to third-party tenants, which in turn operate the facilities (the Real Estate segment and (ii) healthcare services segment, which consists of operating the healthcare facilities (the Healthcare Services segment ). 
 
 We expect to grow our Real Estate segment while diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in investments in joint ventures with larger firms. 
 
 Regional Health is successor to, and a former wholly owned subsidiary of, AdCare Health Systems, Inc. AdCare ). On September 29, 2017, AdCare merged with and into Regional Health, with Regional Health continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger ). 
 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 454 Satellite Boulevard NW, Suite 100, Suwanee, GA 30024, and our telephone number is (678) 869-5116. We maintain a website at www.regionalhealthproperties.com . The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference herein or in any of our filings with the SEC. 
 
 Industry Trends 
 The skilled nursing sector of the long-term care industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and custodial healthcare services generated by an aging population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting of patient care to lower cost settings. The growth of the senior population in the U.S. continues to increase healthcare costs, often faster than the available funding from government-sponsored healthcare programs. In response, federal and state governments have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost effective settings, such as SNFs, for which the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. As a result, SNFs are generally serving a larger population of higher acuity patients than in the past. 
 Growth drivers for SNFs, according to projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau, revolve around the percentage of Americans who are turning 65 increasing from 16 of the population in 2019 to 21.6 of the population in 2030, as well as the average life expectancy of the general population increasing from 79.7 years in 2019 to an expected 81.7 years in 2030. This translates into an estimated increase of the 65+ population from 54.1 million to 80.8 million in 2019 and 2030, respectively. It is expected that these additional 26.7 million Americans will drive up demand for SNFs and facilities that house and provide care to this aging demographic, especially as they age into the prime 75+ age category. 
 4 

The skilled nursing industry is large, highly fragmented, and characterized predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. Based on a decrease in the number of SNFs over the past few years, we expect that the supply and demand balance in the skilled nursing industry will continue to improve. We also anticipate that, as life expectancy continues to increase in the United States, notwithstanding the recent declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to increased deaths amongst younger and middle-aged individuals (due to the overdose epidemic and suicides), the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase. More importantly for our business model, as reported by the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, the percentage of nursing home and senior housing properties that were owned by publicly traded real estate investment trusts REITs was only 10.3 as of the year ended December 31, 2019. This indicates potential acquisitions and consolidation opportunities for Regional Health and organic growth represented by the aforementioned demographic trends. 
 
 We believe the skilled nursing industry has been, and will continue to be, impacted by several other trends. The use of long-term care insurance is increasing among seniors as a means of planning for the costs of skilled nursing care services. In addition, as a result of increased mobility in society, reduced average family size, and increased number of two-wage earner couples, more seniors are looking for alternatives outside their own family for their care. Further, we have identified a widening supply and demand imbalance within the SNF space. According to the American Health Care Association, the number of nursing home facilities has declined from 15,600 facilities in 2016 to 15,200 in July 2022. We anticipate that this decline in the number of nursing home facilities in light of the demographic trends identified above sets up conditions for increased utilization of SNF facilities. 
 
 Our Real Estate Portfolio 
 
 We have a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare investments across the Southeast U.S. that offer a range of services including skilled nursing, assisted and independent living and memory care As of December 31, 2022, we had investments of approximately 66.5 million in twelve health care real estate properties and one leased property. 
 
 Skilled nursing facilities. SNFs provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, activities, housekeeping, nutrition, medication management and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance for activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. 
 
 Independent living communities. Independent living communities are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, activities, nutrition and limited laundry services. Our independent living communities are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. Independent living communities typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee. 
 
 Assisted living communities. ALFs provide services that include assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services bundled within one regular monthly fee usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community on call or at regularly scheduled times. A typical assisted living community is comprised of studios and one- and two-bedroom suites, each equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. 
 
 Memory care communities. Memory care communities offer specialized options, services and clinical programs for individuals with Alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose-built memory care communities offer a more residential environment than offered in a secured unit of a nursing facility. Memory Care communities offer dedicated care and specialized programming from specially trained staff for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living communities. Residents require a higher level of care, a secure environment, customized therapeutic recreation programs and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living communities. Therefore, these communities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents. 
 
 Multi-Service Campuses . Multi-service campuses generally include some combination of co-located skilled nursing, independent living, assisted living and/or memory care units all housed at a single location and operated as a 
 5 

continuum of care. We also refer to continuing care retirement communities as multi-service campuses. These facilities are often marketed as an opportunity for residents to age in place, and tend to attract couples where the individuals may require or benefit from differing levels of care. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio included 2 facilities that we classify as multi-service campuses. 
 
 Portfolio of Healthcare Investments 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned a portfolio of nine SNFs and two multi service facilities strategically located across the Southeast U.S. In addition, we sublease one SNF.

 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following competitive strengths contribute significantly to our success: Geographically Diverse Property Portfolio . Our portfolio of 13 properties, 12 owned and 1 leased, comprising 1,703 licensed beds/units, is diversified across five states. Our properties in any one state did not account for more than 24 of our total properties as of the date of filing this Annual Report. Properties in our largest state, Ohio, are geographically dispersed around the Dayton area. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure. A substantial majority of our real estate properties are leased under triple-net operating leases with initial terms of 10 years pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance and taxes, and utilities. As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the leases had an average remaining initial term of approximately five and a half years. In addition, our leases contain specific rent escalation amounts ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 annually. Further, each lease has one or more renewal options. For the facility subleased by the Company, the renewal option in the sublease agreement is dependent on the Company s renewal of its lease agreement. We also receive additional security under these leases in the form of security deposits from the lessee and guarantees from the parent or other related entities of the lessee. 
 7 

In-House Operating Team As of December 31, 2022, we managed 2 SNFs and an independent village community for a local hospital system in exchange for a management fee. In 2022, we began to utilize our operating team to operate some our owned facilities. By operating the skilled nursing facility, we are directly exposed to the risks and benefits of the performance of the facility. We generally utilize this structure when the current lessee can't support the lease any longer yet the properties present growth opportunities that may be achievable through capital investment and an improvement in operations. In addition, by having an in-house operating team, we can preserve a property's asset value when a tenant defaults on a lease forcing us to step in as operators. 
 
 Ability to Identify Talented Operators As a result of our management team s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to identify qualified local, regional and national operators. We seek operators who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records, and focus on quality care and clinical outcomes. These operators are often located in secondary markets, which generally have lower costs to build and favorable demographics as demonstrated by the fact that the percentage of the population over the age of 65 is greater in the markets where we have invested than in the U.S. as a whole. We believe our management team s experience gives us a key competitive advantage in objectively evaluating an operator s financial position, focus on care and operating efficiency. 
 
 Significant Experience in Proactive Asset Management The members of our management team have significant experience developing systems to collect and evaluate data relating to the underlying operational and financial success of healthcare companies and healthcare-related real estate assets. We are able to utilize this experience and expertise to provide our tenants, when requested, with assistance in the areas of marketing, development, facility expansion and strategic planning. We also use information technology that allows us to efficiently and effectively collect tenant, financial, asset management and acquisitions information. Leveraging this allows us to be lean in our operations and proactive in sharing information with our tenants where we can be helpful to them. We actively monitor the operating results of our tenants, and, when requested, we offer support to our operators to identify and capitalize on opportunities to improve the operations of our facilities and the overall financial and operating strength of our operators. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy primarily is focused on investing capital in our current portfolio and growing our portfolio through the acquisition of skilled nursing and other healthcare facilities. More specifically, we seek to: 
 Focus on Healthcare Real Estate. We intend to continue to focus our investment program on healthcare real estate, predominately senior housing consisting of assisted living, memory care and SNFs. We have historically been focused on senior housing, and our senior management has operating and financial experience and a significant number of relationships in the long-term care industry. In addition, we believe investing in the sector best meets our investing criteria. 
 Diversify Our Portfolio. We look to diversify our portfolio through the acquisition of additional facilities. In addition, we plan to diversify our portfolio of mostly skilled nursing facilities with additional senior housing facilities including assisted living and memory care facilities. As we acquire new facilities, we expect to further add new tenants. 
 8 

Invest Capital in Our Current Portfolio. We intend to continue to support our operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including facility modernization and potentially replacing or renovating facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rent or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. We believe such projects will provide an attractive return on capital and improve the underlying performance of facility operations. 
 Provide Capital to Underserved Operators. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to long-term care operators through the acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for large healthcare REITs. We seek primarily small to mid-size acquisition transactions with a focus on individual facilities with existing operators, as well as small groups of facilities and larger portfolios. In addition to pursuing acquisitions using triple-net lease structures, we may pursue other forms of investment, including partnering with investors, mortgage loans and joint ventures. 
 Identify Talented Operators. As a result of our management team s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified tenants. We seek tenants who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records and focus on patient care. 
 Monitor Investments. We monitor our real estate investments through, among other things: (i) reviewing and evaluating our tenants epidemic and pandemic protocols, including in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) reviewing and evaluating tenant financial statements to assess operational and financial trends and performance; (iii) reviewing the state surveys, occupancy rates and patient payor mix of our facilities; (iv) verifying the payments of property and other taxes and insurance with respect to our facilities; and (v) conducting periodic physical inspections of our facilities. For tenants or facilities that do not meet performance expectations, we may seek to work with our tenants to ensure our mutual success or seek to re-lease facilities to stronger operators. 
 Competition 
 We generally compete for real property investments with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment criteria, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital. 
 Our ability to generate rental revenues from our properties also depends on the competition faced by our tenants (which competition we also directly face when we undertake portfolio stabilization measures in our Healthcare Services segment). Our tenants, as do we, compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operating companies that provide comparable services. Our tenants compete to attract and retain patients and residents based on scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences. The ability of our tenants to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations. 
 
 Revenue Sources and Recognition 
 Patient Care Revenue . Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to receive in exchange for such goods and services. Revenue from our new Healthcare Services business segment is derived from services rendered to patients in the Tara Facility. The Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (ii) state governments under their respective Medicaid and similar programs; (iii) commercial insurers; and (iv) individual patients and clients. The vast majority (greater than 90 of the revenue the Company has recognized is from government sources. The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and other price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from residents or third-party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements, if any, under 
 9 

reimbursement programs. Performance obligations, such as providing room and board, wound care, intravenous drug therapy, physical therapy, and quality of life activities amongst others, are determined based on the nature of the services provided are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Estimated uncollectable amounts due from patients are generally considered implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net patient care revenues. 
 
 Triple-Net Leased Properties. The Company s triple-net leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in rent. The Company recognizes rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In the event the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future collection of rent from one or more tenant(s) of the Company s facilities, rental income for the affected facilities will be recognized only upon cash collection, and any accumulated straight-line rent receivable will be expensed in the period in which the Company first deems rent collection no longer reasonably assured. 
 
 Management Fee Revenues and Other Revenues. The Company recognizes management fee revenues as services are provided. The Company has one contract to manage three facilities (the Management Contract ), with payment for each month of service generally received in full on a monthly basis. As of December 31, 2021, the balance outstanding on the Management Contract was approximately 31,250 and as of December 31, 2022, was 42,250. The maximum penalty for service contract nonperformance under the Management Contract is 50,000 per year, payable after the end of the year. Further, the Company recognizes interest income from loans and investments, using the effective interest method when collectability is probable. The Company applies the effective interest method on a loan-by-loan basis. 
 
 Allowances. The Company assesses the collectability of our rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants. The Company bases its assessment of the collectability of rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. If the Company s evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that the Company will be unable to receive the rent payments or payments on a working capital loan, the Company provides a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset or working capital loan for the portion that we estimate may not be recovered. If the Company changes its assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of future rent payments required by a lease or required from a working capital loan to a tenant, the Company may adjust its reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue or interest revenue from working capital loans to tenants recognized in the period the Company makes such change in its assumptions or estimates. The Company has reserved for approximately 1.5 of our patient care receivables based on accepted industry standards. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company reserved for approximately 1.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables. Accounts receivable, net totaled 6.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared with 2.1 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 Government Regulation 
 Healthcare Regulation . Our tenants, and the Company s Healthcare Services segment are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certain certificate of need CON requirements, government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, qualifications of personnel, adequacy of plant and equipment, data privacy and security, and other laws and regulations governing the operation of healthcare facilities. We expect that the healthcare industry will, in general, continue to face increased regulation and pressure in these areas. The applicable rules are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants to civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including: the possible loss of accreditation or license; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare 
 10 

programs; or facility closure. Changes in laws or regulations, reimbursement policies, enforcement activity, and regulatory non-compliance by tenants, operators, and managers can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition. These effects may adversely impact us, as detailed below, and set forth under Part I-. Item 1A .. Risk Factors in this Annual Report. 
 
 Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste, and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, the Federal False Claims Act, and comparable state counterparts, as well as cost control, healthcare management, and provision of services, among others. We also expect increased and continued efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, and private insurance carriers (including health maintenance organizations and other health plans), to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon tenants (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk, or other possible measures). A significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, existing or future healthcare reform measures, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, changes in enforcement priorities, or significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed or reductions in reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases. 
 Licensure, Certification and CONs. In general, the operators of our SNFs must be licensed and periodically certified through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal, state, and local laws to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legal requirements pertaining to such licensure and certification relate to the quality of medical care provided by the operator, qualifications of the tenant s administrative personnel and clinical staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, and continuing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a skilled nursing facility s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations to us. 
 In addition, many of our SNFs are subject to state CON laws that require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, and introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict a tenant s ability to expand our properties and grow its business in certain circumstances. Such restrictions could have an adverse effect on the tenant s revenues and, in turn, its ability to make rental payments under and otherwise comply with the terms of our leases. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state healthcare program (as discussed below), our ability to do so may be affected by a particular state s CON laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing such changes. 
 Compared to SNFs, seniors housing communities (other than those that receive Medicaid payments) do not receive significant funding from governmental healthcare programs and are subject to relatively few, if any, federal regulations. Instead, to the extent they are regulated, such regulation consists primarily of state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements, and other operational matters, which vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Although recent growth in the U.S. seniors housing industry has attracted the attention of various federal agencies that believe more federal regulation of these properties is necessary, Congress thus far has deferred to state regulation of seniors housing communities. However, as a result of this growth and increased federal scrutiny, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of seniors housing communities. More states are expected to do the same in the future. 
 Fraud and Abuse Enforcement, Other Related Laws, Initiatives, and Considerations. Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and guidance governing their operations and financial and other arrangements. Some of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government healthcare programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Still, 
 11 

other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health, and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government healthcare program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government healthcare programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. 
 Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. This law generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark Law prohibits submitting claims to Medicare if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services to a health service provider with whom the physician has a financial relationship unless the arrangement qualifies under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship, as set forth under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Furthermore, long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals (commonly called whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees, and competitors. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages and a civil penalty of up to 27,018 per claim. 
 Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim act, anti-kickback laws and self-referral prohibitions may also apply to each property operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us. 
 Other legislative developments, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA ), have greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General OIG to audit, investigate, and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in healthcare fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts. 
 Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the applicable regulations, healthcare providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the Department of Health and Human Services HHS Secretary s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS issued an interim Final Rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to HITECH, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 1.9 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released an omnibus final 
 12 

rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of business associate and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. This rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported. Some covered entities have entered into settlement agreements with HHS for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the HITECH Act. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties. 
 There has been an increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement effort and we expect this trend to continue. Under HITECH, state attorneys general have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. Several such actions have been brought against covered entities and business associates, and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who are harmed by HIPAA violations may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator. 
 In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, or security of medical records or other types of medical or personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions, in which case they are not preempted by HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. 
 Also, with respect to HIPAA, in September 2015, OIG issued two reports calling for better privacy oversight of covered entities by the CMS Office for Civil Rights OCR ). The first report, titled OCR Should Strengthen its Oversight of Covered Entities Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Standards, found that OCR s oversight is primarily reactive, as OCR has not fully implemented the required audit program to proactively assess possible noncompliance from covered entities. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR fully implement a permanent audit program and develop a policy requiring OCR staff to check whether covered entities had previously been investigated for noncompliance. The second report, titled OCR Should Strengthen its Follow-up of Breaches of Patient Information Reported by Covered Entities, found that (1) OCR did not record corrective action information for 23 of closed large-breach cases in which it made determinations of noncompliance, and (2) OCR did not record small-breach information in its case-tracking system, which limits its ability to track and identify covered entities with multiple small breaches. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR enter small-breach information into its case-tracking system and maintain complete documentation of corrective actions taken. OCR agreed with OIG s recommendations in both reports. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants. 
 With respect to HIPAA, OCR announced on March 21, 2016, that it had begun a new phase of audits of covered entities and their business associates. OCR stated that it would review policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. 
 Congress has significantly increased funding to the governmental agencies charged with enforcing the healthcare fraud and abuse laws to facilitate increased audits, investigations, and prosecutions of providers suspected of healthcare fraud. As a result, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against healthcare providers have increased significantly in recent years and are expected to continue. A violation of federal or state anti-fraud and abuse laws or regulations, or other related laws or regulations discussed above, by a tenant of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the tenant s liquidity, financial condition, or operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases. The Company could also be adversely affected in the event of a direct violation of such laws or regulations by the Company in its capacity as facility operator with respect to the Company s Health Services segment, or in its capacity as business associate with respect to facilities managed by the Company.

Cares Act and COVID-19 Related Legislation 
 In 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted a series of economic stimulus and relief measures through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ), the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act PPPHCE Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 CAA ). In total, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, and the CAA authorized 178 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund Provider Relief Fund ). These funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay Provider Relief Fund payments as long as they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including reporting requirements, limitations on balance billing, and not using Provider Relief Fund payments to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources have reimbursed or are obligated to reimburse. 
 The Department of Health and Human Services HHS began distributing Provider Relief Fund payments in April 2020 and has made funds available to various provider groups in phases. HHS continues to evaluate and provide allocations of, and issue regulations and guidance regarding, grants made under the CARES Act and related legislation. A number of our tenants have received grants under these laws; however, there are uncertainties regarding the extent to which our tenants will receive such funds, the financial impact of receiving such funds on their operations or financial condition, and whether such tenants will be able to meet the compliance requirements associated with the funds. 
 The CARES Act and related legislation include other provisions offering financial relief. This includes Medicare and Medicaid payment adjustments and an expansion of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which made available accelerated payment of Medicare funds in order to increase cash flow to providers. These payments are loans that providers must repay. Additionally, CMS suspended Medicare sequestration payment adjustments from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, which would have otherwise reduced payments to Medicare providers by 2 percent, but also extended sequestration through 2030. In addition to offering economic relief to individuals and businesses, the CARES Act and related legislation include provisions intended to expand coverage of COVID-19 testing and preventative services, address healthcare workforce needs, ease restrictions on telehealth services during the crisis, and ease other legal and regulatory burdens on healthcare providers. Due to recent enactment of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, and the CAA, there is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding their implementation, and the public health emergency continues to evolve. 
 On June 16, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crises announced the launch of an investigation into the COVID-19 response of nursing homes and the use of federal funds by nursing homes during the pandemic. The Select Subcommittee continued to be active throughout the remainder of 2020 and 2021. In March 2021, the Oversight Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on examining the impact of private equity in the U.S. health care system, including the impact on quality of care provided within the skilled nursing industry. These investigations and hearings could result in legislation imposing additional requirement on our tenant operators. 
 COVID-19 Update 
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the respiratory illness caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19, a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments and other authorities in the United States to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to protect its spread adversely affected our business in 2022, and we expect it will continue to adversely affect our business in 2023 and beyond, for a variety of reasons, including those discussed below and elsewhere hereunder. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company is aware that each of our facilities has reported one or more positive cases of COVID-19 among the residents and/or operator employee populations. Many of our operators have reported incurring significant cost increases as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with dramatic increases for facilities with positive cases. We believe these increases primarily stem from elevated labor costs, including increased use of overtime and bonus pay, as well as a significant increase in both the cost and usage of personal protective equipment, testing equipment, processes and supplies. In terms of occupancy levels, many of our operators have reported experiencing declines, in part due to the elimination or suspension of elective hospital procedures, fewer discharges from hospitals to SNFs, and higher hospital readmittances from SNFs. 
 14 

The COVID-19 pandemic may also lead to temporary closures of nursing facilities, operated by our tenants, which also may affect our tenants ability to make their rental payments to us pursuant to their respective lease agreements. In addition, our tenants operations could be further disrupted if any of their employees, or the employees of their vendors, have, or are suspected of having, COVID-19. This has caused, and may cause in the future, our tenants or their vendors to experience staffing shortages, and this could potentially require our tenants and their vendors to close parts of or entire facilities, distribution centers, or other buildings to disinfect any affected areas. 
 We could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose upon our tenants, or their vendors, certain restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions may be in the form of mandatory closures, requested voluntary closures, bans on new admissions, restricted operations, or restrictions on the importation of necessary equipment or supplies which may adversely affect our tenants operations and their ability to make rental payments to us moving forward. In addition, family members may elect to keep nursing facility residents at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus reducing our tenants revenue. Currently, a number of our tenants have stopped admitting new patients due to rising COVID-19 infections resulting in decreased revenues. 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our tenants may face lawsuits for alleged negligence associated with their responses to the emergency. The costs associated with defending, settling, or paying damages from such claims could negatively impact our tenants operating budgets and affect their ability to meet their obligations under our leases. Further, we may be subject to increased lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants for which they have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. An unfavorable resolution of any such pending or future litigation could materially adversely affect us. The Company is not aware of any such lawsuits against our tenants. 
 If our tenants are unable to make rental payments to us pursuant to their lease obligations, whether due to the tenants decrease in revenues or otherwise, then, in some cases, we may be forced to either attempt to replace tenants or restructure tenants long-term rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place. 
 While the Company has received approximately 80 of its expected monthly rental receipts from tenants for the year ended December 31, 2022, there are a number of uncertainties the Company faces as it considers the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business, including the length of census disruption, elevated COVID-19 operating costs related to personal protection equipment, cleaning supplies, virus testing and increased overtime due to staff illness and the extent to which federal and state funding support will offset these incremental costs for our tenants. To the extent government support is not sufficient or timely to offset these impacts, or to the extent these trends continue or accelerate and are not offset by additional government relief that is sufficient or timely, the operating results of our operators are likely to be adversely affected, some may be unwilling or unable to pay their contractual obligations to us in full or on a timely basis, as has occurred with more than one of our operators. 
 We also do not know the number of facilities that will ultimately experience widespread, high-cost outbreaks of COVID-19, and while we have requested reporting of case numbers from our operators and CMS has required additional reporting by operators, we may not receive accurate information on the number of cases, which could result in a delay in reporting. We expect to see continued increased clinical protocols for infection control within facilities and increased monitoring of employees, guests and other individuals entering facilities; however, we do not yet know if future reimbursement rates will be sufficient to cover the increased costs of enhanced infection control and monitoring. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic s effect on our and our tenants operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the ultimate duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, which may depend on factors such as the development and implementation of an effective vaccine and treatments for COVID-19, government funds and other support for the senior care sector and the efficacy of other policies and measures that may mitigate the impact of the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Due to these uncertainties, we are unable at this time to estimate the effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. 
 
 In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic led to CMS, the OIG and other regulatory agencies implementing various waivers and flexibilities intended to minimize burdens for healthcare providers and other industry participants that faced the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. These included, for example, coverage requirement waivers (e.g., three-day prior hospitalization requirement for SNF stay coverage), exercising administrative discretion in fraud and 
 15 

abuse enforcement, and waivers relating to telehealth and licensure requirements. On January 30, 2023, the Biden Administration announced its intent to end the national emergency and public health emergency declarations on May 11, 2023, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, many of the waivers and flexibilities that were implemented by CMS, the OIG and other regulatory agencies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are now scheduled to expire on May 11, 2023. We are unable to estimate at this time the impact these developments may have on the Company s business. 
 Government Reimbursement 
 The majority of SNFs reimbursement, including our Lumber City, LaGrange, Thomasville, Glenvue and Tara Facilities, is through Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are often SNF s largest source of funding. Senior housing communities generally do not receive funding from Medicare or Medicaid, but their ability to retain their residents is impacted by policy decisions and initiatives established by the administrators of Medicare and Medicaid. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law ). The passage of the Healthcare Reform Law allowed formerly uninsured Americans to acquire coverage and utilize additional healthcare services. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law gave the CMS new authorities to implement Medicaid waiver and pilot programs that impact healthcare and long-term custodial care reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid. These activities promote aging in place, allowing senior citizens to stay longer in senior housing communities and diverting or delaying their admission into SNFs. In December 2017, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance effective January 1, 2019. In December 2018, as a result of the penalty associated with the individual mandate being eliminated, a federal trial court in Texas found that the entire ACA was unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis as to whether the rest of the ACA can survive. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case, and on June 17, 2021, dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the mandate or the remainder of the ACA. Additionally, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the ACA. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these developments on our tenants. The potential risks, however, that accompany these regulatory and market changes are discussed below. 
 Enabled by the Medicare Modernization Act (2003) and subsequent laws, Medicare and Medicaid have implemented pilot programs (officially termed demonstrations or models) to divert elderly from SNFs and promote aging in place in the least restrictive environment. Several states have implemented Home and Community-based Medicaid waiver programs that increase the support services available to senior citizens in senior housing, lengthening the time that many seniors can live outside of a SNF. These Medicaid waiver programs are subject to re-approval, and pilots are time-limited. Roll-back or expiration of these programs could have an adverse effect on the senior housing market. 

Changes in certification and participation requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs have restricted, and are likely to continue to restrict further, eligibility for reimbursement under those programs. On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule that, for the first time in nearly 25 years, comprehensively updated the SNF requirements for participation under Medicare and Medicaid. Among other things, the rule implemented requirements relating to quality of care and quality of life, facility responsibilities and staffing considerations, resident assessments, and compliance and ethics programs. Failure to obtain and maintain Medicare and Medicaid certification by our tenants would result in denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, which would likely result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting in lost revenue for specific patients. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts, and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. Any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on our tenants profitability and cash flows which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be 

16 

adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our tenants operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our tenants or on their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. As a result of the Healthcare Reform Law, and specifically Medicaid expansion and establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges providing subsidized health insurance, more Americans have health insurance. These newly insured Americans utilize services delivered by providers at medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. The Healthcare Reform Law remains controversial. The continued attempts to repeal or reverse aspects of the law could result in insured individuals losing coverage, and consequently, forgoing services offered by provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in this Annual Report concerning a possible repeal of the ACA. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Healthcare Reform Law but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allowed states to decline to participate in the expansion and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is still unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government paid for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, the federal matching rate decreased to 90 in 2020. We cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend the Healthcare Reform Law will be successful. Even absent changes to the Healthcare Reform Law, the executive branch of the federal government may make significant changes to the enforcement and implementation of Healthcare Reform Law requirements. We cannot predict the impact that any such repeal or amendment of the Healthcare Reform Law or related action by the executive branch would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us. We cannot predict whether the existing Healthcare Reform Law, or future healthcare reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators or tenants property or business. If the operations, cash flows, or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially and adversely impacted by the Healthcare Reform Law or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. 

CMS is transitioning Medicare from a traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model to a capitated, value-based, and bundled payment model. In the value-based model, the government pays a set amount for each beneficiary for a defined period of time, based on the beneficiary s underlying medical needs, rather than the actual services provided. The result is increasing use of management tools to oversee individual providers and coordinate their services. This puts downward pressure on the number and expense of services provided. Roughly 11 million Medicare beneficiaries now receive care via Accountable Care Organizations, and Medicare Advantage health plans now provide care for roughly seventeen-million Medicare beneficiaries. The continued trend toward capitated, value-based, and bundled payment approaches has the potential to diminish the market for certain healthcare providers. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 was enacted, which implements value-based purchasing for SNFs. In fiscal year 2019, 2 of SNF payments began to be withheld and 60 of the amount withheld is being redistributed to SNFs as incentive payments through value-based payments. SNFs began reporting the claims-based 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure on October 1, 2015, and began reporting a resource use measure on October 1, 2016. Both measures are publicly available. 

In October 2015, the U.S. Government Accountability Office GAO released a report recommending that CMS continue to improve data and oversight of nursing home quality measures. The GAO found that nursing home quality would be easier to determine if the quality of the underlying data was improved (i.e., by changing the way self-reported data and non-standardized survey methodologies were used). The GAO recommended, among other things, that CMS implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of self-reported data and establish a process for monitoring oversight modifications to better assess their effects. HHS agreed 

17 

with the GAO s recommendations, and to the extent such recommendations are implemented, they could impact our operators and tenants. 

The majority of Medicare payments continue to be made through traditional Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service schedules. The Medicare and CHIP (Children s Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act of 2015 MACRA addressed the risk of a cut in Medicare payments for physician services. However, other annual Medicare payment regulations, particularly with respect to certain hospitals, skilled nursing care, and home health services, have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, MACRA established a multi-year transition into pay-for-quality approaches for Medicare physicians and other providers. This includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The current Value-Based Payment Modifier program expired at the end of 2018, and the first Merit-based Incentive Payment System MIPS adjustments began in 2019. The continued implementation of pay-for-quality models is expected to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare properties. 

OIG has increased focus in recent years on billing practices by SNFs. In September 2015, OIG issued a report calling for reevaluation of the Medicare payment system for SNFs. In particular, OIG found that Medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded SNFs costs for therapy, and that, under the current payment system, SNFs increasingly billed for the highest level of therapy even though key beneficiary characteristics remained largely the same. OIG determined that its findings demonstrated the need for CMS to reevaluate the Medicare SNF payment system, concluding that payment reform could save Medicare billions of dollars and encourage SNFs to provide services that are better aligned with beneficiaries care needs. OIG also formulates a formal work plan that addresses nursing facilities. The current work plan regarding nursing facilities includes several areas of investigation and review, including but not limited to (1) SNFs compliance in reporting related-party costs to Medicare, (2) potentially preventable inpatient hospitalizations of SNF residents, and (3) Medicare payments to SNFs under CMS Patient Driven Payment Model. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope, or outcome of any such investigations on our tenants if these recommendations are implemented. 

On July 29, 2016, CMS issued its final rule laying out the performance standards relating to preventable hospital readmissions from SNFs. The final rule includes the SNF 30-day All Cause Readmission Measure, which assesses the risk-standardized rates of all-cause, all conditions, unplanned inpatient readmissions for Medicare fee-for-service patients of SNFs within 30 days of discharge from admission to an inpatient prospective payment system IPPS hospital, critical access hospital CAH ), or psychiatric hospital. The final rule includes the SNF 30-Day potentially preventable readmission measure as the SNF all condition risk adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission measure. This measure assesses the facility-level risk-standardized rate of unplanned, potentially preventable hospital readmissions for SNF patients within 30 days of discharge from a prior admission to an IPPS hospital, CAH, or psychiatric hospital. Hospital readmissions include readmissions to a short-stay acute-care hospital or CAH, with a diagnosis considered to be unplanned and potentially preventable. 

On September 16, 2016, CMS issued its final rule concerning emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid participating providers, including long-term care facilities and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The rule is designed to ensure providers and suppliers have comprehensive and integrated emergency policies and procedures in place, in particular during natural and man-made disasters. Under the rule, facilities are required to (i) document risk assessment and emergency planning, (ii) develop and implement policies and procedures based on that risk assessment, (iii) develop and 

18 

maintain an emergency preparedness communication plan in compliance with both federal and state law, and (iv) develop and maintain an emergency-preparedness training and testing program. Facilities were required to have been in compliance with these regulations by November 15, 2017. We cannot predict the impact of these regulations on our tenants. 

On February 8, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA extending the reduction in Medicare provider payments, commonly called the sequestration. This automatic payment reduction remains at 2 and applies to all Medicare physician claims and certain other claims, including physician-administered medications, submitted after April 1, 2013. Scheduled to expire in 2025, the BBA extended the sequestration through 2027. CMS suspended Medicare sequestration payment adjustments from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, but further extended sequestration through 2030. 

In 2019, CMS began including the new long-term-stay hospitalization measurement that the agency began tracking in 2018 in its quality measures for the consumer-based Nursing Home Compare website. CMS also began posting the number of hours worked by a facility s non-nursing staff in July 2018. In October 2019, CMS resumed posting the average number of citations per inspection for each state and the nation as a whole, which may affect each facility s health inspection rating on the site. We cannot predict how this data will affect our tenants business. 

In 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a National Nursing Home Initiative to coordinate and enhance civil and criminal enforcement actions against nursing homes with grossly substandard deficiencies. Such enforcement activities are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy period of time. An adverse resolution of any of these enforcement activities or investigations incurred by any of our tenant operators may involve injunctive relief and/or substantial monetary penalties, either or both of which could have a material adverse effect on their reputation, business, results of operations, and cash flow. 

CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2020 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for SNFs. This final rule has been effective as of October 1, 2019. The policies in the final rule continue to shift Medicare payments from volume to value by implementing SNF Value-Based Purchasing program VBP and SNF Quality Reporting Program QRP ). CMS will be using the Patient-Driven Payment Model PDPM ), which focuses on the patient s condition and resulting care needs rather than on the amount of care provided in order to determine Medicare payment. Based on changes contained within this final rule, CMS estimates that the fiscal year 2020 aggregate impact will be an increase of 851 million in Medicare payments to SNFs, resulting from the fiscal year 2020 SNF market basket update required by the BBA to be 2.8 . The effect of the 2020 prospective payment system PPS rate update on our tenants revenues will be dependent upon their census and the mix of patients at the various PPS and PDPM pay rates. In addition, we cannot predict how future changes may impact reimbursement rates under the SNF PPS and PDPM system. 

CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2021 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for SNFs. It includes routine technical rate-setting updates to the SNF PPS payment rates and adopts the revised Office of Management and Budget statistical area delineations. In addition, the rule applies a 5-percent cap on wage index decreases from Fiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2021. The rule also finalized changes to the International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 (ICD-10) code mappings. CMS also finalized updates to the SNF VBP Program regulation text at 42 C.F.R. 413.338 to reflect previously finalized policies and updated the 30-day Phase One Review and Correction deadline for the baseline period quarterly report. CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2022 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for SNFs. CMS estimates that the aggregate impact of the payment policies set forth in the final rule would result in an approximate increase of 410 million in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs. In addition, the final rule includes several policies that update the QRP and VBM for fiscal year 2022. For example, CMS adopted a 

19 

new claims-based measure, the SNF Healthcare-Associated Infections measure, beginning with the FY 2023 SNF QRP. Among other changes, CMS also adopted the COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) Measure requiring SNFs to report on COVID-19 vaccination of their staff to assess whether SNFs are taking steps to limit the spread of COVID-19 among the HCP, reduce transmission risks within their facilities, and help sustain the ability of SNFs to continue serving their communities through the pandemic and beyond. 

CMS released its final rule outlining fiscal year 2023 Medicare payment rates and quality programs for SNFs. CMS estimates that the aggregate impact of the payment policies set forth in the final rule would result in an increase of 2.7 , or approximately 904 million, in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. CMS also adopted a new quality measure for the SNF QRP that assesses the rate of influenza vaccination coverage among health care personnel beginning with the fiscal year 2024 SNF QRP. In addition, CMS finalized several changes to the PDPM ICD-10 code mappings to improve consistency between the ICD-10 code mappings and current ICD-10 coding guidelines. CMS also finalized its proposal to suppress (not apply) the SNF 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure as part of the performance scoring for the fiscal year 2023 SNF VBP due to circumstances caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency affecting the ability to make fair, national comparisons of SNFs performance scores. 

We are an ongoing participant in, and a direct recipient of, reimbursement under these government reimbursement programs with respect to the Lumber City, LaGrange, Thomasville, Glenvue and Tara Facilities. Additionally, a significant portion of the revenue of the healthcare operators to which we lease, and sublease properties is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, and any adverse change in such programs could negatively impact an operator s ability to meet its obligations to us and our operating results directly due to the Company operating the Lumber City, LaGrange, Thomasville, Glenvue and Tara Facilities. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. 
 These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and, in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Although we do not currently operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of our current and former properties from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property s value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release. 
 Under the terms of our leases, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, there is no assurance that our tenants will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims. In general, we have also agreed to indemnify our tenants against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, our properties at any time before the applicable lease commencement date. 
 To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience increased frequency of severe weather conditions or natural disasters or other changes to weather patterns, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or cash flow may be adversely affected. In addition, government regulation intended to mitigate the impact of climate change, severe weather patterns, or natural disasters could result in additional required capital expenditures to comply with such regulation without a corresponding increase in our revenues. 
 We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2022 or 2021. 
 20 

Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2022, our Real Estate segment had 10 employees of which all were full-time employees (excluding facility-level employees related to the Company s Management Contract for three facilities in Ohio). Our Healthcare Services segment had approximately 136 full-time equivalent employees. The Company s Healthcare Services segment has had to utilize agency staffing to a much greater degree due to the COVID-19 pandemic related staffing shortages. The Company is actively working to attract and retain permanent employees. We offer benefits to care for the diverse needs of our employees. These include health benefits, paid vacations, benefits to support employee mental health, including an employee assistance program. As we continue to face evolving environmental and health challenges, we continually review our offerings to improve the competitiveness of our total compensation programs, including our health benefit offerings. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors 
 The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, operations and financial condition. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. This section does not describe all risks applicable to our business, and we intend it Item 1A only as a summary of certain material factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of the common stock, no par value per share (the common stock ), and the 10.875 Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, no par value per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), could decline. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Our portfolio stabilization in our Healthcare Services segment expose the Company to the various risks facing our tenants. 
 While the Company is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior living, when business conditions require, the Company may undertake portfolio stabilization measures in order to preserve the value of our assets. This portfolio stabilization measure exposes the Company directly to all the risks our tenants face as discussed in this Risk Factor -Risk Related to our Business and Industry section. 
 
 Our leases with tenants comprise our rental revenue and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to satisfy their obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our business depends upon our tenants meeting their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate and other taxes and maintain and repair the leased properties. We give no assurance that these tenants will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by these tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any failure by these tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we give no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, severe cold and flu seasons, epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other widespread illnesses. 
 
 We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, severe cold and flu seasons, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other widespread illnesses. In addition, we are subject to risk associated with government measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including the global health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is impossible to predict the severity of the annual cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics, pandemics or any other widespread illnesses. 
 21 

The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below: 
 Risks Related to Revenue : Our revenues and our tenants revenues are dependent, in part, on occupancy. In addition to the impact of increases in mortality rates on occupancy of our operating facilities, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may prevent prospective occupants and their families from visiting our facilities and limit the ability of new occupants to move into our facilities due to heightened move-in criteria and screening. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic on occupancy remains uncertain, a decrease in occupancy could affect the net operating income of our tenants and the ability of our tenants to make contractual payments to us. 

Risks Related to Tenant Financial Condition: In addition to the risk of decreased revenue from tenant payments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Risks Related to Operations : Operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of public health regulations. Operators and tenants are also subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay, such as hazard pay, may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees. In addition, our operations or those of our tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our tenants. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our tenants cost of insurance is expected to increase, and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. Our exposure to COVID-19 related litigation risk may be increased if the tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, we may face increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures and restrictions on the movement of people. 

Risks Related to Property Acquisitions and Dispositions: As a result of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business and related industries, our investments in and acquisitions of senior housing properties, as well as our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results, may be limited. Such disruptions to acquisition, disposition and development activity may negatively impact our long-term competitive position. 

Risks Related to Liquidity: The COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures implemented by governments worldwide have had severe global macroeconomic impacts and have resulted in significant financial market volatility. An extended period of volatility or a downturn in the financial markets could result in increased cost of capital. If our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged period of decreased revenue and limited acquisition and disposition activity operations could adversely affect our financial condition and long-term growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets. 

Public health crises, severe cold and flu seasons, epidemics and pandemics, and other widespread illnesses could result in adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additional risks that may be associated with other future public health crises, severe cold and flu seasons, epidemics or pandemics, or other widespread illnesses include: 
 one or more of our tenants could experience deteriorating financial conditions and be unable or unwilling to pay rent on time and in full (which has, and could continue to result from, among other reasons (i) increased operating costs and staffing requirements related to compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC protocols, (ii) decreased occupancy rates, (iii) increased scrutiny by regulators, (iv) potential repayments of relief funds received by tenants, (v) nursing or other staffing 

22 

shortages; or (vi) decisions by elderly individuals to avoid or delay entrance into assisted living and other long-term care facilities); 

health orders, rent moratoriums, and other initiatives by federal, state, and local authorities could affect our operators and our ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent; 

the possibility we may have to restructure tenants obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us; 

decreased occupancy, including due to early resident move-outs, operators delaying new resident admissions and potential occupants postponing moves to our operators facilities; 

the possibility that hospitals may cancel or significantly reduce elective surgeries, thereby reducing the number of people in need of skilled nursing care; 

increased costs or delays that we have incurred, and may continue to incur, if we need to reposition or transition any of our currently-leased properties to another tenant or operator, which have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our revenues and results of operations; 

the expiration, or lack of enforcement, of liability immunity for health care providers in relation to a qualified pandemic under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (the PREP Act ); and 

complete or partial closures of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government actions or directives. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or other future health crises, may impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and those of our operators, depends on many factors which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration, spread and severity of any outbreak, the timing, distribution and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments, the actions taken to contain the outbreak or health crisis or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic or other health crisis and containment measures. 
 We depend on affiliates of Aspire and C.R Management for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by such entities to satisfy their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report, our 13 properties (excluding the three facilities that are managed by us) are operated by a total of 11 separate tenants and two by the Company, with each of our tenants being affiliated with one of six local or regionally-focused operators. We refer to our tenants who are affiliated with the same operator as a group of affiliated tenants. Each of our operators operate (through a group of affiliated tenants) between one and five of our facilities, with our material operators, Aspire and C.R Management, each operating (through a group of affiliated tenants) five and two facilities, respectively. We therefore depend on tenants who are affiliated with Aspire and C.R Management for a significant portion of our revenues. We give no assurance that the tenants affiliated with C.R Management and Aspire will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their obligations under the applicable leases and subleases, and any inability or unwillingness by such tenants to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 A prolonged economic slowdown could adversely impact the results of operations of our tenants, which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us. 
 We believe the risks associated with our investments will be more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession (such as the most recent recession) due to the adverse impact caused by various factors, including pandemics and other public health crises, inflation, deflation, increased unemployment, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a distressed real estate market, market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence. This difficult operating environment caused by an economic slowdown or recession could have an adverse impact on the ability of our tenants to maintain occupancy rates, as the Company has experienced with its Healthcare Services segment, which could harm their financial condition and our financial condition Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses by our tenants could adversely affect our income from investments in our portfolio. 
 23 

Increased competition, as well as increased operating costs, could result in lower revenues for some of our tenants (and our Healthcare Services segment) and may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. 
 The long-term care industry is highly competitive, and we expect that it will become more competitive in the future. The Company and our tenants are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. The Company and our tenants compete on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas. Operating expenses such as food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service continue to increase. We cannot be certain that all of our tenants will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet their full obligations to us. Our tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract patients or residents or expand their businesses which would in turn affect their ability to make their lease payments to us. 
 
 In addition, the market for qualified nurses, healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive, and the Company and our tenants may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our tenants could affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. This situation could be particularly acute in certain states and cities that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements. The Tara Facility has incurred additional expenses related to the high cost of staffing agencies. 
 
 Disasters and other adverse events may seriously harm our business. 
 Our facilities and our business may suffer harm as a result of natural or man-made disasters such as storms, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, terrorist attacks and other conditions. The impact, or impending threat, of such events may require that our tenants evacuate one or more facilities, which could be costly and would involve risks, including potentially fatal risks, for their patients. The impact of disasters and similar events is inherently uncertain. Such events could harm our tenants patients and employees, severely damage or destroy one or more of our facilities, harm our tenants business, reputation and financial performance, or otherwise cause our tenants businesses to suffer in ways that we are unable to predict. 
 Tenant financial or legal difficulties could limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new tenants. 
 If a lessee experiences financial or legal difficulties, it could fail to pay us rent when due, assert counterclaims, or seek bankruptcy protection. In the case of a master lease, this risk is magnified, as a default could reduce or eliminate rental revenue from several properties. Over the past three years, four of our operators have experienced or continue to experience financial or legal difficulties resulting in non-payment of rent or bankruptcy. See Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Leased and Subleased Facilities to Third-Party Operators for further discussion. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and depending on its scope and duration could continue to cause, financial and legal difficulties for certain of our lessees. If an operator is unable to comply with the terms of its leases, we could be asked to defer rent or forced to modify the leases in ways that are unfavorable to us. Alternatively, the failure of an operator to perform its obligations under a lease or other agreements with us could force us to declare a default and terminate the lease. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement operator or re-lease the property on substantially equivalent or better terms than the prior lease, if at all. If a lessee seeks bankruptcy protection, it could delay our efforts to collect past due amounts owed to us under the applicable lease and ultimately preclude collection of all or a portion of those amounts. 
 We have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our tenants. Although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our tenants, and our standard lease agreements generally require our tenants to indemnify us and carry insurance to protect us in certain cases, a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed the aggregate of our and our respective tenants insurance coverage, which would require us to make payments to cover any such judgment. 
 24 

Our tenants who engage in business with the federal government may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. See Government Regulation-Healthcare Regulation in Part I, Item 1., Business in this Annual Report. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits are brought against our tenants, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our tenants liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and on their ability to satisfy their obligations under our leases, which, could in turn, have a material adverse effect on us. 
 If we must replace any of our tenants, we might be unable to rent the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, in which case we may operate the facility ourselves and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term. If any of our triple-net leases are not renewed, we would attempt to rent those properties to another tenant. In addition, following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant. We also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases or other arrangements with new tenants on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate and bed taxes, and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. In addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 In the event of non-renewal or a tenant default, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. 
 
 Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure and security, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that tenant s particular operations. If a current tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant. Supply chain volatility and labor shortages may increase these construction costs. In addition, approvals of local authorities for any required modifications and/or renovations may be necessary, resulting in delays in transitioning a facility to a new tenant. These expenditures or renovations and delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Moreover, in connection with certain of our properties, we have entered into intercreditor agreements with the tenants lenders or tri-party agreements with our lenders. Our ability to exercise remedies under the applicable leases or to reposition the applicable properties may be significantly delayed or limited by the terms of the intercreditor agreement or tri-party agreement. Any such delay or limit on our rights and remedies could adversely affect our ability to mitigate our losses and could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 The amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by policies maintained by ourselves and our tenants may not adequately insure against losses. 
 We maintain or require in our leases that our tenants maintain all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. Although we regularly review the amount and scope of insurance maintained by our tenants and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry, we give no assurance that our tenants will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance. We also give no assurance that our tenants will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our leases, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite the policies maintained by our tenants. 
 25 

For various reasons, including to reduce and manage costs, many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy. Companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities generally estimate the future cost of general and professional liability through actuarial studies that rely primarily on historical data. However, due to the rise in the number and severity of professional claims against healthcare providers, these actuarial studies may underestimate the future cost of claims, and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims. As a result, the tenants of our properties who self-insure could incur large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. If tenants of our properties decide to implement a captive or self-insurance program, any large funded and unfunded general and professional liability expenses incurred could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur substantial liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Following the occurrence of such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We give no assurance that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. 
 
 Our tenants and our Healthcare Segment depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors, and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced. 
 The ability of our tenants to generate revenue and profit determines the underlying value of that property to us. Revenues of our tenants are generally derived from payments for patient care. Sources of such payments include the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health care service plans, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements, self-insured employers, as well as the patients themselves . 
 The health care industry continues to face increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs. Federal legislative and regulatory policies have been adopted and may continue to be proposed that would reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to nursing facilities. Moreover, state budget pressures continue to result in adoption of Medicaid provider payment reductions in some states. Increasingly, state Medicaid programs are providing coverage through managed care programs under contracts with private health plans, which is intended to decrease state Medicaid costs. In light of continuing federal and state Medicaid program reforms, budget cuts, and regulatory initiatives, no assurance can be given that the implementation of such regulations and reforms will not have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our tenants and/or borrowers which, in turn, could affect their ability to meet their contractual obligations to us. 
 Furthermore, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and signed into law that repealed the individual mandate in the ACA. Because the U.S. Supreme Court s 2012 decision finding the ACA constitutional was grounded, at least in part, on the inclusion of the individual mandate in the law, a federal trial court found the entire law unconstitutional upon the mandate s repeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis as to whether the rest of the ACA could survive. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case, and on June 17, 2021, dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the mandate or the remainder of the ACA. While there have been efforts to repeal the law and enact alternative reforms, the Biden Administration has indicated it will support and expand upon the ACA. There is no assurance that the implementation of ACA or any subsequent modifications or 
 26 

related legal challenges will not adversely impact the operations cash flows or financial conditions of our lessees, which subsequently could materially and adversely impact our revenue and operations. 
 Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including insurance companies and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our tenants and directly upon our Healthcare Services segment. 
 Our Healthcare Services segment and tenants rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including the Medicare (both traditional Medicare and managed Medicare/Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues, as does our Healthcare Services segment. Federal and state legislators and regulators have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers, and budget crises and financial shortfalls have caused states to implement or consider Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. Private third-party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We give no assurance that our Healthcare Services segment or tenants that currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement will be adequately reimbursed for the services they provide. Significant limits by governmental and private third-party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition, and operations of some of our tenants. These limits may be imposed by statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property, or private payor efforts. Additionally, these limits could adversely affect our tenants' ability to comply with the terms of our leases and have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We pursue property acquisitions and seek strategic opportunities in the ordinary course of our business, which may result in significant usage of management resources or costs, and we may not fully realize the potential benefits of such transactions or the acquisition may not prove to be successful. 
 
 We regularly review, evaluate, engage in discussions regarding, and pursue acquisitions of properties and seek other strategic opportunities in the ordinary course of business in order to maximize stockholder value. We may devote a significant amount of our management resources to, and incur significant costs in connection with, such transactions, which may not result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction and could negatively impact our operations. In addition, there is no assurance that we will fully realize the potential benefits of any past or future acquisition or strategic transaction. Also, we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our acquired healthcare properties, including contingent liabilities, or our newly acquired healthcare properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. Such costs may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 If we are unable to resolve our professional and general liability actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company is a defendant in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims that the services the Company provided during the time it operated SNFs resulted in injury or death to former patients. Although the Company settles cases from time to time if settlement is advantageous to the Company, the Company vigorously defends any matter in which it believes the claims lack merit and the Company has a reasonable chance to prevail at trial or in arbitration. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and there is risk in the Company s strategy of aggressively defending these cases. There is no assurance that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. 
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the Company is a defendant in 10 professional and general liability actions, one such action was commenced on behalf of a former patient of the Company and the remaining actions were commenced by former patients of the Company s current or prior tenants. These actions generally seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for former patients who were allegedly injured or died while patients of our facilities due to professional negligence or understaffing. One such action, on behalf of the Company s former patient, is covered by insurance, except that any award of punitive damages would be excluded from such coverage. 9 of such actions relate to events which occurred after the Company transitioned (the Transition the operations of the 
 27 

facilities in question to a third-party operator and which are subject to such operators indemnification obligations in favor of the Company. 
 The Company maintains insurance for professional and general liability claims for its Healthcare Services segment, which included in 2022 the LaGrange, Lumber City, Meadowood, Thomasville, Glenvue and Tara Facilities, however for claims prior to January 1, 2020, the Company is self-insured against professional and general liability claims since it discontinued its healthcare operations in connection with the Transition. The Company established a self-insurance reserve for these professional and general liability claims, included within Accrued expenses in the Company s audited consolidated balance sheets of 0.1 million and 0.2 million at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately 0.1 million and 0.1 million was reserved for settlement amounts in Accounts payable in the Company s audited consolidated balance sheets. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. in this Annual Report. Also see Critical Accounting Policies - Self Insurance Reserve in Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report. 
 The Company believes that most of the professional and general liability actions are defensible and intends to defend them through final judgment, unless settlement is more advantageous to the Company. Accordingly, the self-insurance reserve primarily reflects the Company s estimate of settlement amounts for the pending actions, as appropriate, and legal costs of settling or litigating the pending actions, as applicable. 
 Because the self-insurance reserve is based on estimates, the amount of the self-insurance reserve may not be sufficient to cover the settlement amounts actually incurred in settling the pending actions, or the legal costs actually incurred in settling or litigating the pending actions. The amount of the self-insurance reserve may increase, perhaps by a material amount, in any given period, particularly if the Company determines that it has probable exposure in one or more actions. If we are unable to resolve the pending actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a history of operating losses and may incur losses in the future. 
 
 The geographic concentration of our facilities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn or adverse regulatory changes in those areas. 
 Our properties are located in five states, with our largest presence in Ohio. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of state and local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules, regulations and reimbursement rates or criteria, changes in demographics, state and local funding, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand and reimbursement for skilled nursing services in these states could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our tenants revenue, costs and results of operations, affecting their ability to meet their obligations to us. 
 
 Risks Related to Laws and Regulations 
 
 Healthcare reform legislation impacts cannot accurately be predicted and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 We and the healthcare operators leasing our properties depend on the healthcare industry and are susceptible to risks associated with healthcare reform. Legislative proposals are introduced each year that would introduce major changes in the healthcare system, both nationally and at the state level. Certain measures could negatively affect our business or the businesses of our tenants if enacted. Efforts may also be made to reduce the age at which individuals become eligible for Medicare, which could have an adverse impact on our tenants because Medicare sometimes reimburses long term care providers at rates lower than those paid by commercial payors. We also believe that additional resources may be dedicated to regulatory enforcement, which could increase our tenants costs of doing business and negatively impact their ability to pay their rent obligations to us. Additional stimulus funding for state and local governments may have a positive impact on our tenants because it may alleviate some pressures on state and local governments to reduce overall Medicaid expenditures. 
 Our tenants are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry that include those relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, ownership of facilities, addition of facilities and equipment, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, quality of care, patient 
 28 

rights and insurance, fraudulent or abusive behavior, and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. If our tenants or operators fail to comply with the laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to their businesses and the operation of our properties, they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs, face bans on admissions of new patients or residents, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant operational changes. Changes in enforcement policies by federal and state governments have also resulted in a significant increase in inspection rates, citations of regulatory deficiencies and sanctions, including terminations from Medicare and Medicaid programs, bars on Medicare and Medicaid payments for new admissions, civil monetary penalties and criminal penalties. Our tenants and operators could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation, lawsuit or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, if our tenants residents do not have insurance, it could adversely impact the tenants ability to satisfy their obligation to us. 
 
 Failure by our tenants to comply with various local, state, and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make lease payments to us. 
 
 The failure of our tenants to comply with federal, state, or local regulations could result in penalties which could include loss or restriction of license, loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal, state and local health care programs, or closure of the facility. These regulations have increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss or imposition of restrictions on any required license, registration, certificate of need, provider agreement or certification would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operator. Additionally, failure by any of our operators to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm, and therefore could harm our business. 
 
 If we or our tenants fail to adhere to applicable privacy and data security laws, or experience a data security incident or breach, this could have a material adverse effect on us or on our tenants ability to meet their obligations to us. 
 
 We and our tenants are subject to HIPAA and various other state and federal laws that relate to privacy and data security, including the reporting of data breaches involving personal information as discussed in Government Regulation , in Part I, Item1., Business in this Annual Report. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a materially adverse effect on us and the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us. Furthermore, the adoption of new privacy, security and data breach notification laws at the federal and state level could require us or our tenants to incur significant compliance costs. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. 
 While we and our tenants maintain various security controls, there is a risk of data security incidents or breaches resulting from unintentional or deliberate acts by third parties or insiders attempting to obtain unauthorized access to information, destroy or manipulate data, or disrupt or sabotage information systems. The trend toward increased remote work and rapid implementation of telehealth within the health care industry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have created new or increased cyber risks. Cyber incidents range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems to sophisticated attacks by hacking groups and nation-state actors. Information technology systems are a vital part of the business of our Company and our tenants, and a security incident or breach could result in a material loss of business, business interruption, loss of patient or other critical data, regulatory enforcement, substantial legal liability and reputational harm. Despite the deployment of commercially reasonable efforts and sophisticated techniques to prevent cyber incidents, information systems remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used by hackers continue to evolve and are designed not to be detected. In fact, some unauthorized access may not be detected for an extended period of time. As a result, we or our tenants may suffer cybersecurity incidents where we or our tenants have implemented cybersecurity protections. A data security incident or breach occurring at or involving the Company could have a material adverse impact on our Company. Where the data security incident or breach occurs at or involves a tenant, this could jeopardize the tenant s ability to fulfill its obligations to us. 
 
 As an owner with respect to real property, we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities. 
 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we, as a current or previous owner of real property, may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal, remediation of, or related releases, of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and 
 29 

damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability regardless of the owner s knowledge of, or responsibility for, the presence or disposal of such substances. As a result, liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property. 
 The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefor could exceed the value of the property and the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect an operator s ability to attract additional patients or residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could negatively impact our revenues. See Environment Regulation in Part I, Item 1., Business in this Annual Report. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Resources and Indebtedness 
 Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid. 
 Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. In addition, all of our owned healthcare properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and may not be readily sold. Additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. For example, all of our healthcare properties are special purpose properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential, retail or office use. In addition, transfers of operations of SNFs, ALF s and other healthcare facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. Thus, if the operation of any of our healthcare properties becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of improvements or other factors such that a tenant becomes unable to meet its obligations to us, then the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less, particularly relative to the amount owed on any related mortgage loan, than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses. Furthermore, the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of a tenant who has defaulted on its lease could be delayed by the approval process of any federal, state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the tenant with a new tenant licensed to manage the facility. In addition, certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment. Should such events occur, our revenues would be adversely affected. 
 
 We have substantial indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 52.2 million in indebtedness, including current maturities of debt. We may also obtain additional short-term and long-term debt to meet future capital needs, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, which would increase our total debt. Our substantial amount of debt could have negative consequences to our business. For example, it could: 
 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business; 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to interest and principal payments on outstanding debt, thereby limiting the availability of cash flow for dividends and other general corporate purposes; 

require us to maintain certain debt coverage and other financial ratios at specified levels, thereby reducing our financial flexibility; 

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; 

expose us to increases in interest rates for our variable rate debt; 

limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all, for working capital, debt service requirements, expansion of our business or other general corporate purposes; 

limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity on the same or more favorable terms, or at all; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; 

30 

limit our ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; 

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and 

limit our ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. 

In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend in part on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants contained in those agreements or are unable to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, the lenders and other parties to those arrangements could accelerate the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness. 
 We may not have sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs. 
 For the year ended and as of December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of 6.9 million. At December 31, 2022, we had 0.8 million in cash, including a Medicaid overpayment of 0.2 million received in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, which was repaid in February 2023 and is recorded in Accrued Expenses in the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company has approximately 3.1 million of restricted cash and 52.2 million in indebtedness net of 1.1 million deferred financing and unamortized discounts, of which the Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately 1.8 million during the next twelve-month period. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, as a result of the suspension of the dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend period, the Company has 45.9 million of accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends. 
 Management anticipates access to, and receipt of, several sources of liquidity, including cash from operations and cash on hand. We have routine ongoing discussions with existing and potential new lenders to refinance current debt on a longer-term basis and, in recent periods, have refinanced short-term acquisition-related debt with traditional long-term mortgage notes, some of which have been executed under government guaranteed lending programs. 
 In order to satisfy the Company s capital needs, the Company is undertaking measures to grow its operations, streamline its cost infrastructure and otherwise increase liquidity by: (i) refinancing or repaying debt to reduce interest costs and mandatory principal repayments, with such repayment to be funded through potentially expanding borrowing arrangements with certain lenders; (ii) increasing future lease revenue through acquisitions and investments in existing properties; (iii) modifying the terms of existing leases; (iv) replacing certain tenants who default on their lease payment terms; and (v) reducing other and general and administrative expenses. 
 The Company anticipates that these actions, if successful, will provide the opportunity to maintain its liquidity, thereby permitting the Company to better meet its operating and financing obligations. However, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful. 
 We rely on external sources of capital to fund our capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing debt commitments. 
 We rely on external sources of capital, including, from time to time, private or public offerings of debt or equity, the assumption of secured indebtedness, or mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, then we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including: (i) the performance of the national and global economies generally; (ii) competition in the healthcare industry; (iii) issues facing the healthcare industry, including regulations and government reimbursement policies; (iv) our tenants operating costs; (v) the market s perception of our growth potential; (vi) the market value of our properties; (vii) our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends on our common stock and preferred stock, if any; and (viii) the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We may not be in a position to take advantage of future investment opportunities if we are unable to access capital markets on a timely basis or are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms. 
 In particular, we are subject to risks associated with debt financing, which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repay maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance 
 31 

or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay our maturing indebtedness. Furthermore, if we have to pay higher interest rates in connection with a refinancing, the interest expenses relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase, which could reduce our profitability. Moreover, additional debt financing increases our leverage. The degree of leverage could have important consequences to our shareholders, including affecting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy in general. 
 Our ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent, in part, on the market price of our capital stock and the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, including the amount of the undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 As with other publicly-traded companies, the availability of equity capital depends, in part, on the market price of our capital stock, which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time, and could negatively impact the market price of our stock, including: 
 the extent of investor interest; 

our financial performance and that of our tenants; 

general stock and bond market conditions; and 

other factors such as governmental regulatory action. 

Further, our ability to raise capital through equity sales has been adversely affected by the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock and the amount of the undeclared preferred stock dividend in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, which was 45.9 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Covenants in the agreements evidencing our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations. 
 The terms of our credit agreements and other agreements evidencing our indebtedness require us to comply with a number of financial and other covenants which may limit management s discretion by restricting our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, and create liens. Any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness and conduct our operations is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. Any such breach could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
 We periodically, but not less than annually, evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, operator performance and legal structure. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, then we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs. 
 Economic conditions and turbulence in the credit markets may create challenges in securing indebtedness or refinancing our existing indebtedness. 
 Depressed economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, turmoil in the mortgage market and depressed real estate markets have in the past contributed, and will in the future contribute, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets and the economy as a whole. Significant market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to secure indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness. 
 32 

Risks Related to Investment in Our Securities and Organizational Documents 
 The price of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock has fluctuated, and a number of factors may cause the price of our common stock or Series A Preferred Stock to decline. 
 The market price of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock has fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly in the future, depending upon many factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 

changes in our financial condition, performance and prospects; 

changes in general economic and market conditions and other external factors; 

the market price of securities issued by other companies in our industry; 

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships or other transactions; 

press releases or negative publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in healthcare; 

government action or regulation, including changes in federal, state and local healthcare regulations to which our tenants are subject; 

changes in financial estimates, our ability to meet those estimates, or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors; and 

future sales of the Company's equity or debt securities. 

In addition, to the above factors, the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock may also fluctuate based upon additional factors including: 
 prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock; 

trading prices of preferred equity securities issued by other companies in our industry; 

the annual yield from distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments; and 

the amount of undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, which was 45.9 million at December 31, 2022. 

Furthermore, the stock market in recent years has experienced sweeping price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These market fluctuations may also cause the price of our stock to decline. 
 In the event of fluctuations in the price of our stock, shareholders may be unable to resell shares of our stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares. Additionally, due to fluctuations in the price of our stock, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on past results as an indication of future performance. 
 Our common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation. 
 Our common stock ranks junior to our Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This means that, unless accumulated accrued dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for all past dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid, or set aside for payment on, our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock the applicable liquidation preference plus all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends. 
 33 

We suspended the quarterly dividend payment with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and in June 2018, we determined to continue such suspension indefinitely. As a result of such suspension, the Company has 45.9 million of undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears as of December 31, 2022. See Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report. As a result, the value of your investment in our common stock may suffer if sufficient funds are not available to first satisfy our obligations to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in the event of our liquidation. 
 There are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future. 
 We are a holding company, and we have no significant operations. We rely primarily on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us so we may, among other things, pay dividends on our capital stock, if and to the extent declared by the Company's Board of Directors (the Board ). The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other distributions to us depends on their earnings and may be restricted in the future by the terms of certain agreements governing their indebtedness. If our subsidiaries are in default under such agreements, then they may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us. 
 In addition, we may only pay dividends on our capital stock if we have funds legally available to pay dividends and such payment is not restricted or prohibited by law, the terms of any shares with higher priority with respect to dividends or any documents governing our indebtedness. We are restricted by Georgia law from paying dividends on our capital stock if we are not able to pay our debts as they become due in the normal course of business or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy preferential rights upon dissolution. In addition, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payments, for all past dividend periods. In addition, future debt, contractual covenants or arrangements that we or our subsidiaries enter into may restrict or prevent future dividend payments. 
 As such, we are currently unable, on a temporary or permanent basis, to pay dividends on our stock, including our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock. The payment of any future dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend, among other things, on the earnings and results of operations of our subsidiaries, their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to us under agreements governing their indebtedness, our financial condition and capital requirements, any debt service requirements and any other factors the Board deems relevant. 
 The Board suspended dividend payments indefinitely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. Such dividends are currently in arrears since the fourth quarter 2017. See Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report. As a result of this dividend suspension, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all past dividend periods. 
 The ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended and currently in effect (the Charter ), may prevent or restrict you from acquiring or transferring shares of the common stock. 
 As a result of the Merger, the Charter contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of the common stock. These ownership and transfer restrictions include that, subject to the exceptions, waivers and the constructive ownership rules described in the Charter, no person (including any group as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act may beneficially own, or be deemed to constructively own by virtue of the ownership attribution provisions of the Code, in excess of 9.9 (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding common stock. The Charter also prohibits, among other things, any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of common stock to the extent that such ownership would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT by reason of being closely held under the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or that would cause the Company to otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT. Furthermore, any transfer, acquisition or other event or transaction 
 34 

that would result in common stock being beneficially owned by less than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution) will be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such common stock. These ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control involving the Company that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 Provisions in Georgia law, our Charter and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control or management that shareholders may consider desirable. 
 Various provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the GBCC and the Charter and Bylaws may inhibit changes in control not approved by the Board and may have the effect of depriving our investors of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of the common stock and other securities in the event of an attempted hostile takeover. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the market price of the common stock and other securities. These provisions include: 
 the ownership and transfer restrictions contained in the Charter with respect to the common stock; 

a requirement that special meetings of shareholders be called by the Board, the Chairman, the President, or the holders of shares with voting power of at least 25 ; 

advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; 

a requirement that directors may only be removed for cause and then only by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes entitled to be cast in the election of such directors; 

a prohibition of shareholder action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent; 

availability of blank check preferred stock; and 

a charter constituency clause authorizing (but not requiring) our directors to consider, in discharging their duties as directors, the effects of the Company s actions on other interests and persons in addition to our shareholders. 

In addition, the Company has elected in the Bylaws to be subject to the fair price and business combination provisions of the GBCC. The business combination provisions generally restrict us from engaging in certain business combination transactions with any interested shareholder (as defined in the GBCC) for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless certain designated conditions are met. The fair price provisions generally restricts us from entering into certain business combinations with an interested shareholder unless the transaction is unanimously approved by the continuing directors who must constitute at least three members of the Board at the time of such approval, or the transaction is recommended by at least two-thirds of the continuing directors and approved by a majority of the shareholders excluding the interested shareholder. 
 The Board can use these and other provisions to prevent, delay or discourage a change in control of the Company or a change in our management. Any such delay or prevention of a change in control or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a takeover transaction pursuant to which our shareholders could receive a substantial premium over the current market price of the common stock and other securities, which in turn may limit the price investors might be willing to pay for such securities. 
 
 If we fail to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the NYSE American and the NYSE American determines to delist the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, then the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of such securities, impair the value of your investment, adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds and subject us to additional trading restrictions and regulations . 
 If the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted from the NYSE American, such securities may trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought 
 35 

and sold, transactions could be delayed, and any security analysts coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in such securities, further limiting the liquidity of the common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from the NYSE American and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. Any such limitations on our ability to raise debt and equity capital could prevent us from making future investments and satisfying maturing debt commitments. 
 In addition, if the Company fails for 180 or more consecutive days to maintain a listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on a national exchange, then: (i) the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock will be increased from 10.875 per annum to 12.875 per annum on the 181st day; and (ii) the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Board in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, the Charter. Such increased dividend rate and voting rights will continue for so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is not listed on a national exchange. Additionally as the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four consecutive dividend periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend period to has increased to 12.875 ; commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment date following such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. See Note 10- Common and Preferred Stock to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 The costs of being publicly owned may strain our resources and impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. We are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources and have required us, and may in the future require us, to hire additional accounting and financial resources with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. In addition, failure to maintain such internal controls could result in us being unable to provide timely and reliable financial information which could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or cause us to be late in the filing of required reports or financial results. Any of the foregoing events could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 If we lose our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 We are dependent on our management team, and our future success depends largely upon the management experience, skill, and contacts of our management and the loss of any of our key management team could harm our business. If we lose the services of any or all of our management team, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Our directors and officers substantially control all major decisions. 
 
 36 

Our directors and officers beneficially own a significant number of shares of our outstanding common stock. Therefore, our directors and officers will be able to influence major corporate actions required to be voted on by shareholders, such as the election of directors, the amendment of our charter documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers, reorganizations, sales of substantially all of our assets and liquidation. Furthermore, our directors will be able to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including decisions to issue additional capital stock, implement stock repurchase programs and incur indebtedness. This control may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Corporate Office

Item 3. Lega l Proceedings 
 The Company is a defendant in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims that the services the Company provided during the time it operated SNFs resulted in injury or death to patients. Although the Company settles cases from time to time when settlement can be achieved on a reasonable basis, the Company vigorously defends any matter in which it believes the claims lack merit and the Company has a reasonable chance to prevail at trial or in arbitration. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. There is no assurance that the outcomes of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. Although arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business, certain of these matters are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Professional and General Liability Claims to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 ., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 The Company believes that most of the professional and general liability actions are defensible and intends to defend them through final judgment unless settlement is more advantageous to the Company. See Risks Related to Our Business and Industry- If we are unable to resolve our professional and general liability actions on terms acceptable to us, then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in Part I, Item 1.A, Risk Factors. in this Annual Report. 
 Certain other legal matters are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies Other Legal Matters to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report.

PART II 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related St ockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Market for Registrant s Common Equity 
 The common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE American under the symbol RHE. Based on information supplied from our transfer agent, there were approximately 5,766 shareholders of record of the common stock as of March 3, 2023. 
 We are a holding company and we have no significant operations. We rely primarily on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us so we may, among other things, pay dividends on the common stock, and the Series A Preferred Stock, if and to the extent declared by the Board. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other distributions to us depends on their earnings and may be restricted by the terms of certain agreements governing their indebtedness. If our subsidiaries are in default under such agreements, then they may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us. 
 In addition, we may only pay dividends on the common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock if we have funds legally available to pay dividends and such payment is not restricted or prohibited by law, the terms of any shares with higher priority with respect to dividends or any documents governing our indebtedness. We are restricted by Georgia law from paying dividends on the common stock and the Series A Preferred Stock if we are not able to pay our debts as they become due in the normal course of business or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy preferential rights of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. In addition, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock unless full cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payments, for all past dividend periods. In addition, future debt, contractual covenants or arrangements we or our subsidiaries enter into may restrict or prevent future dividend payments. 
 The Board suspended dividend payments with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and determined to continue such suspension indefinitely in June 2018. Accordingly, the Company has not paid dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock since the third quarter of 2017. See Part II, Item 7., Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report. As a result of this dividend suspension, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment, for all past dividend periods. Additionally, as the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four consecutive dividend periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend periods has increased to 12.875 ; commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment date following such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. See Note 10- Common and Preferred Stock to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2022, there were no open-market repurchases of the common stock or the Series A Preferred Stock. 
 For further information, see Note 10 - Common and Preferred Stock to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Item 6. [Reserved]

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 We plan to grow our Real Estate segment while diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in healthcare real estate, including investments in joint ventures with larger health care investors. 
 
 Industry Trends and Uncertainties 
 Our operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. Together with the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in interest rates, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, high inflation and increased volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limited the availability of capital. In 2022, several of our operators notified us that they could not continue to maintain the lease payment given the state of the facilities operations. In addition, one operator was notified by the State of Alabama to transition the facility to a new operators or the state was going to shut down the facility. 
 
 COVID-19 Pandemic . Many of our operators have reported incurring significant cost increases as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these increases primarily stem from elevated labor costs, including increased use of overtime and bonus pay, as well as a significant increase in both the cost and usage of personal protective equipment, testing equipment, processes and supplies. In terms of occupancy levels, many of our operators have reported experiencing declines, in part due to the elimination or suspension of elective hospital procedures, fewer discharges from hospitals to SNFs, and higher hospital readmittances from SNFs. The COVID-19 pandemic may also lead to temporary closures of nursing facilities operated by our tenants, impairing our tenants ability to make their rental payments to us pursuant to their respective lease agreements. 
 
 Portfolio Stabilization Measures . In the past our operators did not provide lease guarantees from affiliated entities. Given this, certain operators have terminated their leases in light of operational difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests in real estate, when business conditions require, the Company undertakes portfolio stabilization measures. The table below summarizes the lease terminations since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company s resulting portfolio stabilization measures:

 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021 : 
 Patient care revenues Patient care revenues for our Healthcare Services segment, as a result of the Company taking over operations at the LaGrange and Lumber City locations in May of 2022, the Thomasville location in July of 2022, 
 44 

and the Glenvue location in August of 2022, increased to 22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from approximately 9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Rental revenues. Total rental revenue decreased by approximately 3.3 million, or 20.5 , to 12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease reflects approximately 3.1 million decrease in straight-line rent due to the C.R Management and Beacon Health Management Lease Terminations recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022. For further information see Note 6 - Leases , to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Annual Report. 
 Other revenues Other revenues decreased by approximately 0.07 million, or 71.5 , to 0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with approximately 0.09 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Patient care expense Patient care expense was 20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 9.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The current period expense, which required an increased level of staffing, is due to the additional facilities we operated when compared to the prior year. 
 Facility rent expense Facility rent decreased by approximately 1.6 million, or 24.6 , to 4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with approximately 6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is due primarily to an amendment to the Foster Lease as well as forgiveness for unpaid rent. See Note 6 - Leases , to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately 0.2 million or 7.2 , to 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to the reduction in depreciation from fully depreciated equipment and computer related assets in the current year.

Other operating expenses Other operating expenses increased by approximately 0.9 million or 84 , to 2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to professional and legal services related to operator transition transactions and additional expenses incurred in the current year from our expanded Healthcare Services segment. 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net decreased by approximately 0.1 million or 5.2 , to 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease reflects the lower amount of debt outstanding. See Note 8 Notes Payable and Other Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. of this Annual Report 
 
 Loss on Lease Termination- The loss on lease termination for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 is comprised of the write-off of straight line rent and a right of use asset. 
 
 Other expense, net Other expense, net decreased by approximately 4.1 million, generating income of 2.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with an expense of 1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. These expenses in both years are related to professional and legal services to evaluate and assist with possible opportunities to improve the Company s capital structure. The expenses were offset by a 2.4 million gain related to the write-down of certain accounts payable balances for unclaimed property. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company intends to pursue measures to grow its operations, streamline its cost infrastructure and otherwise increase liquidity, including: (i) refinancing or repaying debt to reduce interest costs and mandatory principal repayments, with such repayment to be funded through potentially expanding borrowing arrangements with certain lenders; (ii) increasing future lease revenue through acquisitions and investments in existing properties; (iii) modifying 
 46 

the terms of existing leases; (iv) replacing certain tenants who default on their lease payment terms; and (v) reducing other and general and administrative expenses. 
 Management anticipates access to several sources of liquidity, including cash on hand, collection of patient accounts receivable, and debt refinancing during the twelve months from the date of this filing. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 0.8 million in unrestricted cash, including a Medicaid overpayment of 0.2 million, which was included in Accrued Expenses in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and repaid by the time of this filing. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 the Company had 7.6 million of accounts receivable, mainly consisting of patient account receivables, which the Company plans to collect over the next twelve months. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated negative cash flow from continuing operations of 3.5 million, mostly due to the increase in patient accounts receivable. The Company anticipates positive cash flow from operations in the future as the patient accounts receivable is collected, subject to the continued uncertainty in the industry, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Subsequent to year end, the Company collected 1.9 million from the Employee Retention Tax Credit and continues to focus on collecting the patient receivables generated from operating five skilled nursing facilities in Georgia in 2022. 
 The Company is current with all of its debt and other financial obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company benefited from various, stimulus measures not made available during the year ended December 31, 2021, made available to it through the CARES Act enacted by Congress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which allowed for, among other things: (i) a deferral of debt service payments on U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA loans to maturity, (ii) an allowance for debt service payments to be made out of replacement reserve accounts for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD loans and (iii) debt service payments to be made by the SBA on all SBA loans. For further information see Note 8 Notes Payable and Other Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 In early 2020, the Company began on-going efforts to investigate alternatives to retire or refinance our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, exchange offers, tender offers, or otherwise. Our ability to retire or refinance our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. There can be no assurance that any such alternative will be pursued or accomplished, and we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in any of these activities on desirable terms. Costs associated with these efforts have been expensed as incurred in Other expense, net and were 1.3 million and approximately 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Series A Preferred Dividend Suspension 
 We suspended the quarterly dividend payment with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and on June 8, 2018, the Board suspended quarterly dividend payments indefinitely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2022, as a result of the suspension of the dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend period, the Company has approximately 45.9 million of undeclared Series A Preferred Stock dividends in arrears. The dividend suspension has provided the Company with additional funds to meet its ongoing liquidity needs. As the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four dividends periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend periods has increased to 12.875 , which is equivalent to approximately 3.20 per share each year, commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment 
 47 

date following such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. 
 Debt 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 52.2 million in indebtedness, net of 1.1 million deferred financing and unamortized discounts. The Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately 1.8 million during the next twelve-month period, which include approximately 1.3 million of routine debt service amortization, approximately 0.4 million payments on other non-routine debt and a 0.1 million payment of bond debt. 
 Debt Refinance . On October 21, 2022, the Company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, consummated a HUD refinancing of its senior mortgages on three SNFs in Ohio. Funding was provided by Newpoint Real Estate Capital LLC Newpoint pursuant to three HUD guaranteed secured Healthcare Facility Notes (the HUD Notes ). Proceeds from the HUD Notes were used to pay off existing HUD guaranteed secured mortgages and pay transaction costs. Newpoint is the servicer on other loans extended to the Company. 
 The aggregate principal amount of the three HUD Notes is 7.8 million, and the interest rate on the three HUD Notes is 3.97 fixed for the full term of each HUD Note. The Northwood HUD Note has a principal amount of 5.0 million and matures on November 1, 2052. The Greenfield HUD Note has a principal amount of 2.0 million and matures on November 1, 2052. The Pavilion HUD Note has a principal amount of 0.8 million and matures on December 1, 2039. Payments of principal and interest on the HUD Notes commenced on October 1, 2022. Each HUD Note is secured by a Healthcare Deed to Secure Debt, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents covering the facilities. Newpoint may declare the loans, accrued interest and any other amounts immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default. 
 On September 30, 2021, the Company and the Exchange Bank of Alabama executed a 5.1 million Promissory Note with a 3.95 annual fixed interest rate and maturity date of October 10, 2026 (the Coosa Credit Facility ). The Coosa Credit Facility refinanced 5.1 million prime + 1.5 variable interest rate debt owed to Metro City Bank with a maturity date of January 31, 2036, (the Coosa MCB Loan ). The Coosa Credit Facility is secured by the assets of the Company s subsidiary Coosa Nursing ADK, LLC Coosa which owns the 124-bed SNF located in Glencoe, Alabama (the Coosa Facility and the assets of the Company s subsidiary Meadowood Property Holdings, LLC Meadowood which owns the 161-bed assisted living facility located in Glencoe, Alabama (the Meadowood Facility ). The Company incurred approximately 0.1 million in new deferred financing fees and expensed approximately 0.1 million deferred financing fees associated with the Coosa MCB Loan. 
 Consequently, the Company recorded a net gain of approximately 0.1 million on extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2021, consisting of the 0.2 million gain on forgiveness of the PPP Loan partially offset by 0.1 million of expensed deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of the Coosa MCB Loan. 
 Debt Modification . In conjunction with the September 30, 2021, Coosa Facility refinance, the Company and the Exchange Bank of Alabama signed an agreement on October 1, 2021, (the Meadowood Credit Facility ), that extended the maturity date on the 3.5 million Meadowood Credit Facility, as amended, in senior debt other mortgage indebtedness secured by the assets of Coosa and the assets of Meadowood, from May 1, 2022, to October 1, 2026. Additionally on December 30, 2022, the Company extended the maturity date on approximately 0.5 million other debt from August 25, 2023, to August 25, 2025 (known as the KeyBank Exit Notes ). 
 
 In February 2022, the Company commenced an offer to exchange any and all of its outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for newly issued shares of the Company's 12.5 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. On July 25, 2022, the Company terminated such exchange offer, as a result of the failure to obtain the requisite approval from the holders of common stock.

For further information see Note 8 Notes Payable and Other Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report . 
 Changes in Operational Liquidity 
 
 Beginning in 2021, several of the Company s operators have defaulted on their contractual obligations and elected to transition the facilities back to the Company. Given the complexities in identifying and negotiating with new operators, the Company was forced to become the licensed operator of the facilities, most importantly the eight leased facilities under the Foster Lease . Operating the facilities requires substantial working capital until the facilities can begin receiving the government reimbursements. 
 
 Powder Springs Lease. In December 2020, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with two affiliates of Wellington. Following the Wellington Lease Termination, effective January 1, 2021, Regional leased the Powder Springs Facility to PS Operator LLC PS Operator ), an affiliate of Empire Care Center, pursuant to a sublease (the PS Sublease ). The PS sublease contained a variable lease component. For more information, see Note 6- Leases to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized and collected 1.4 million of variable rent for the Powder Springs Facility replacing approximately 2.0 million of cash rent previously anticipated from the Wellington Tenant. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized and collected .9 million in rent. 
 
 Healthcare Services segment. As part of the Portfolio Stabilization initiative, the company took back five facilities in 2022. In addition to becoming the licensed operator, the Company is obligated to fund the working capital needs of each facility until patient reimbursement collections begin. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Healthcare Services lost 1.9 million and 1.8 million, respectively. In addition, the Account Receivable for the segment increased from 0.9 million in 2021 to 6.5 million in 2022. As described in more detail as referenced in Note 6 - Leases, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report, the Company terminated the master lease. As of December 31 2022, the company operated 2 facilities.

The subsidiary level requirements are as follows: (i) financial covenants measured against subsidiaries of the Company; and (ii) financial covenants measured against third-party operator performance. Some covenants are based on annual financial metric measurements whereas others are based on monthly and quarterly financial metric measurements (the Financial Covenants ). The Company routinely tracks and monitors its compliance with its covenant requirements.

 Evaluation of the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 Under the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether or not the entity s current financial condition, including its sources of liquidity at the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued, will enable the entity to meet its obligations as they come due within one year of the date of the issuance of the Company s consolidated financial statements and to make a determination as to whether or not it is probable, under the application of this accounting guidance, that the entity will be able to continue as a going concern. The Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a

going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
 In applying applicable accounting guidance, management considered the Company s current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows, the Company s obligations due over the next twelve months as well as the Company s recurring business operating expenses. The Company is able to conclude that it is probable that the Company will be able to meet its obligations arising within one year of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements within the parameters set forth in the accounting guidance. 
 Receivables 
 Our operations could be adversely affected if we experience significant delays in receipt of rental income from our operators and our patient care revenues. Our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon the relative amounts of current assets (principally cash and accounts receivable) and current liabilities (principally accounts payable and accrued expenses). In that regard, accounts receivable can have a significant impact on our liquidity. 
 As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company reserved for approximately 1.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables. We continually evaluate the adequacy of our bad debt reserves based on aging of older balances, payment terms and historical collection trends. Accounts receivable, net totaled 6.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared with 2.1 million at December 31, 2021.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Guarantee 
 On November 30, 2018, the Company subleased five of the Company s facilities located in Ohio (the Aspire Facilities to affiliates of Aspire, pursuant to those subleases (the Aspire Subleases ), whereby the Aspire affiliates took possession of, and commenced operating, the Aspire Facilities as subtenant. The Aspire Subleases became effective on December 1, 2018 and are structured as triple net leases. The Aspire Facilities are comprised of: (i) a 94-bed skilled nursing facility located in Covington, Ohio (the Covington Facility ); (ii) an 80-bed assisted living facility located in Springfield, Ohio (the Eaglewood ALF Facility ); (iii) a 99-bed skilled nursing facility located in Springfield, Ohio (the Eaglewood Care Center Facility ); (iv) a 50-bed skilled nursing facility located in Greenfield, Ohio (the H C of Greenfield Facility ); and (v) a 50-bed skilled nursing facility located in Sidney, Ohio (the Pavilion Care Facility ). Pursuant to the Aspire Subleases, the Company agreed to indemnify Aspire against any and all liabilities imposed on them as arising from the former operator, capped at 8.0 million. The Company has assessed the fair value of the indemnity agreements as not material to the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2022.

 Professional and General Liability 
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the Company is a defendant in a total of 10 professional and general liability actions. The Company has one legacy action from prior to the Transition and is a named party in 9 actions related directly to patient care that our current or prior tenants provided to their patients. For further information, see below and Note 15 Subsequent Events to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the Company is a defendant in one professional and general liability action commenced on behalf of one of our former patients who received care at one of our facilities prior to the Transition. The plaintiff in this action alleges negligence due to failure to provide adequate and competent staff resulting in injuries, pain and suffering, mental anguish and malnutrition and seeks unspecified actual and compensatory damages, and unspecified punitive damages. This action is covered by insurance, except that any punitive damages awarded would be excluded from coverage. 
 As of the date of filing this Annual Report, the Company is also a defendant in 9 professional and general liability actions which set forth claims relating to time periods after the Transition, on behalf of former patients of our current or prior tenants. These actions generally seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for former patients who were allegedly injured or died due to professional negligence or understaffing at the applicable facility operated by our tenants. These actions on behalf of former patients of our current or prior tenants all relate to events which occurred after the Company transitioned the operations of the facilities in question to a third-party operator (and of which four such actions relate to events which occurred after the Company sold such facilities) and are subject to such operators indemnification obligations in favor of the Company. 
 The Company maintains insurance for professional and general liability claims for its Healthcare Services segment however, for claims prior to January 1, 2020, the Company is self-insured against professional and general liability 
 54 

claims since it discontinued its healthcare operations in connection with the Transition. The Company established a self-insurance reserve for these professional and general liability claims, included within Accrued expenses in the Company s audited consolidated balance sheets of 0.1 million and 0.2 million at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Additionally at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately 0.1 million and 0.1 million was reserved for settlement amounts in Accounts payable in the Company s audited consolidated balance sheets. 
 Accordingly, the self-insurance reserve accrual primarily reflects the Company s estimate of settlement amounts for the pending actions, as appropriate and legal costs of settling or litigating the pending actions, as applicable. These amounts are expected to be paid over time as the legal proceedings progress. The duration of such legal proceedings could be greater than one year subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022; however management cannot reliably estimate the exact timing of payments. 
 See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-K and Rule 8-03 of Article 8 of Regulation S-X. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we review our judgments and estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, doubtful accounts, income taxes, stock compensation, intangible assets, extinguishment of debt, self-insurance reserve and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates. These estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change. 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , in this Annual Report. 
 
 Revenue Recognition and Allowances 
 Patient Care Revenue . The Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 requires a company to recognize revenue when the company transfers control of promised goods and services to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to receive in exchange for such goods and services. Revenue from our new Healthcare Services business segment is derived from services rendered to patients in the Tara Facility. The Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (ii) state governments under their respective Medicaid and similar programs; (iii) commercial insurers; and (iv) individual patients and clients. The vast majority (greater than 90 of the revenue the Company has recognized is from government sources. The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and other price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from residents or third-party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements, if any, under reimbursement programs. Performance obligations, such as providing room and board, wound care, intravenous drug therapy, physical therapy, and quality of life activities amongst others, are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Estimated uncollectable amounts due from patients are generally considered implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net patient care revenues. 
 Triple-Net Leased Properties. Triple-Net Leased Properties. The Company s triple-net leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in rent. The Company recognizes rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability is probable. FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 
 55 

2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as codified in ASC 606, does not apply to rental revenues, which are the Company s primary source of revenue. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in straight-line rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. In the event the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future collection of rent from one or more tenant(s) of the Company s facilities, rental income for the affected facilities is recognized only upon cash collection, and any accumulated straight-line rent receivable is expensed in the period in which the Company deems rent collection to no longer be probable. Accordingly, rental revenues were recorded on a cash basis for one facility in Alabama for the month of December 2021 and two facilities in Georgia for the fourth quarter of 2020, (until operator or Company management transition on January 1, 2021, for both properties. For additional information with respect to such facilities, see Note 6 - Leases to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Management Fee Revenues and Other Revenues. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as codified in ASC 606, which requires a company to recognize revenue when the company transfers control of promised goods and services to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to receive in exchange for such goods and services. The Company recognizes management fee revenues as services are provided. The Company has one contract to manage three facilities (the Management Contract ), with payment for each month of service generally received in full on a monthly basis. The maximum penalty for service contract nonperformance under the Management Contract is 50,000 per year, payable after the end of the year. Further, the Company recognizes interest income from loans and investments, using the effective interest method when collectability is probable. The Company applies the effective interest method on a loan-by-loan basis. 
 
 Allowances. The Company assesses the collectability of its rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants. The Company bases its assessment of the collectability of rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. If the Company s evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that the Company will be unable to receive the rent payments or payments on a working capital loan, then the Company provides a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset or working capital loan for the portion that we estimate may not be recovered. Payments received on impaired loans are applied against the allowance. If the Company changes its assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of future rent payments required by a lease or required from a working capital loan to a tenant, then the Company may adjust its reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue or interest revenue from working capital loans to tenants recognized in the period the Company makes such change in its assumptions or estimates. The Company has reserved for approximately 1.5 of our patient care receivables based on the history provided by Vero Health for private payors and continues to assess the adequacy of such reserve. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company reserved for approximately 1.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables. Accounts receivable, net totaled 6.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared with 2.1 million at December 31, 2021. 
 Leasing. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU ASU 2016-02, Leases, as codified in ASC 842, using the non-comparative transition option pursuant to ASU 2018-11. The Company recognized both right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases in which we lease land, real property or other equipment, electing the practical expedient to maintain the prior operating lease classification. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company assesses any new contracts or modification of contracts in accordance with ASC 842 to determine the existence of a lease and its classification. We are reporting revenues and expenses for real estate taxes and insurance where the lessee has not made those payments directly to a third party in accordance with their respective leases with us. Additionally, we now expense certain leasing costs, other than leasing commissions, as they are incurred. Current GAAP provides for the deferral and amortization of such costs over the applicable lease term. Adoption of ASU 2016-02 has not had a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements, other than the initial balance sheet impact of recognizing the right-of-use assets and the right-of-use lease liabilities. Upon adoption, we recognized operating lease assets of 39.8 million on our consolidated balance sheet for the period ended March 31, 2019, which represents the present value of minimum lease payments associated with such leases. Also, upon adoption, we recognized operating lease liabilities of 41.5 million on our consolidated balance sheet for the period ended March 31, 2019. The present value of minimum lease payments was calculated on each lease using a 
 56 

discount rate that approximated our incremental borrowing rate and the current lease term and upon adoption we utilized a discount rate of 7.98 for the Company s leases. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Leases to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Asset Impairment 
 We review the carrying value of long-lived assets that are held and used in our operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined based upon expected undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, utilizing management s best estimate, assumptions, and projections at the time. If the carrying value is determined to be unrecoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset. We estimate the fair value of assets based on the estimated future discounted cash flows of the asset. Management has evaluated its long-lived assets and identified no material asset impairment during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is subject to annual testing for impairment. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a facility below its carrying amount. We perform annual testing for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (see Note 5 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report). 
 Stock Based Compensation 
 The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation , which requires the use of the fair-value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements under which employees, non-employees, and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (options, warrants or restricted shares). All awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over their vesting terms. 
 Self-Insurance Reserve 
 
 The Company maintains insurance for professional and general liability claims for its Healthcare Services segment, which includes the Tara Facility or any other facility, such as the Meadowood Facility which the Company is likely to operate, however for claims prior to January 1, 2020, the Company is self-insured against professional and general liability claims since it discontinued its healthcare operations in connection with the Transition. The Company evaluates quarterly the adequacy of its self-insurance reserve based on a number of factors, including: (i) the number of actions pending and the relief sought; (ii) analyses provided by defense counsel, medical experts or other information which comes to light during discovery; (iii) the legal fees and other expenses anticipated to be incurred in defending the actions; (iv) the status and likely success of any mediation or settlement discussions, including estimated settlement amounts and legal fees and other expenses anticipated to be incurred in such settlement, as applicable; and (v) the venues in which the actions have been filed or will be adjudicated. The Company believes that most of the professional and general liability actions are defensible and intends to defend them through final judgment unless settlement is more advantageous to the Company. Accordingly, the self-insurance reserve reflects the Company s estimate of settlement amounts for the pending actions, if applicable, and legal costs of settling or litigating the pending actions, as applicable. Because the self-insurance reserve is based on estimates, the amount of the self-insurance reserve may not be sufficient to cover the settlement amounts actually incurred in settling the pending actions, or the legal costs actually incurred in settling or litigating the pending actions. See Note 7 Accrued Expenses and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. 
 Income Taxes 
 As required by ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , we established deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates in effect 
 57 

when such temporary differences are expected to reverse. When necessary, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2022, the Company has a valuation allowance of approximately 20.2 million. In future periods, we will continue to assess the need for and adequacy of the remaining valuation allowance. ASC 740 provides information and procedures for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns. 
 Among other changes, the Tax Reform Act reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, net operating loss NOL carry forwards generated in tax years 2018 and forward have an indefinite life. For this reason, the Company has taken the position that the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangibles can be used to support an equal amount of the deferred tax asset related to the 2018 NOL carry forward generated. 
 In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the annual income tax rate, or the need for and magnitude of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on, among other things, knowledge of operations, markets, historical trends and likely future changes and, when appropriate, the opinions of advisors with knowledge and expertise in certain fields. Due to certain risks associated with our estimates and assumptions, actual results could differ. Judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Company classifies unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax balances. 
 The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous state and local jurisdictions. In general, the Company s tax returns filed for the 2019 through 2022 tax years are still subject to potential examination by taxing authorities. To the Company s knowledge, the Company is not currently under examination by any major income tax jurisdiction.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Regional Health Properties, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regional Health Properties, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter cherry in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Patient Care Revenue Recognition 
 
 Description of Matter 
 The Company had 22 million in patient care revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. As disclosed in the Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides patient care services to customers and receives payments for those services from Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurers, and individual patients. Net revenues are recorded at the transaction price, which the Company determines based on contractually agreed-upon amounts or rates, adjusted for estimates of variable consideration, such as implicit price concessions. Management estimates variable 
 61 

consideration using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information, which includes contractual agreements, discount policies, and historical reimbursement experience. The Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price. 
 
 Management makes significant judgment in the estimation of variable consideration. Such assumptions include the application of historical collection rates, by payor, and consideration of other changes in the current business operations and external environment, to the current period revenues. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates. Changes in these estimates can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 Based on our knowledge of the Company, we determined the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over patient care revenue. Our audit procedures included the following: 
 Obtained an understanding of the internal controls and processes in place over the Company s patient care revenue recognition process. 

Analyzed the significant assumptions and estimates made by management as discussed above. 

Assessed the recorded revenue by selecting a sample of transactions, analyzing the related contract, testing management s identification of distinct performance obligations, and comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

of the revenue the Company has recognized is from government sources. The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and other price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the services provided. These amounts are due from residents or third-party payors and include variable consideration for retroactive adjustments from estimated reimbursements, if any, under reimbursement programs. Performance obligations, such as providing room and board, wound care, intravenous drug therapy, physical therapy, and quality of life activities amongst others, are determined based on the nature of the services provided are determined based on the nature of the services provided. Estimated uncollectable amounts due from patients are generally considered implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net patient care revenues. Triple-Net Leased Properties. The Company s triple-net leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in rent. The Company recognizes rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability is probable. ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as codified in ASC 606, does not apply to rental revenues, which is a portion of the Company s revenue. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in straight-line rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. In the event the Company cannot reasonably estimate the future collection of rent from one or more tenant(s) of the Company s facilities, rental income for the affected facilities is recognized only upon cash collection, and any accumulated straight-line rent receivable is expensed in the period in which the Company deems rent collection to no longer be probable. For additional information with respect to such facilities, see Note 2 Liquidity and Note 6 Leases . Management Fee Revenues and Other Revenues . On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as codified in ASC 606, which requires a company to recognize revenue when the company transfers control of promised goods and services to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to receive in exchange for such goods and services. The Company recognizes management fee revenues as services are provided. The Company has one contract to manage three facilities (the Management Contract ), with payment for each month of service generally received in full on a monthly basis. The maximum penalty for service contract nonperformance under the Management Contract is per year, payable after the end of the year. Further, the Company recognizes interest income from loans and investments, using the effective interest method when collectability is probable. The Company applies the effective interest method on a loan-by-loan basis. Allowances. The Company assesses the collectability of its rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants. The Company bases its assessment of the collectability of rent receivables and working capital loans to tenants on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. If the Company s evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that the Company will be unable to receive the rent payments or payments on a working capital loan, then the Company provides a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset or working capital loan for the portion that we estimate may not be recovered. Payments received on impaired loans are applied against the allowance. If the Company changes its assumptions or estimates regarding the collectability of future rent payments required by a lease or required from a working capital loan to a tenant, then the Company may adjust its reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue or interest revenue from working capital loans to tenants recognized in the period the Company makes such change in its assumptions or estimates. See Note 6 Leases . The Company has reserved for approximately of our patient care receivables based on the historic industry standards and continues to assess the adequacy of such reserve. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company reserved for approximately million and million, respectively, of uncollected receivables. Accounts receivable, net totaled million at December 31, 2022 compared with million at December 31, 2021.

 . For the Company s CON/bed licenses that are not separable from the buildings, the estimated useful life is based on the building life when acquired with a remaining average estimated useful life of approximately . The Company evaluates the recoverability of the finite lived intangibles whenever an impairment indicator is present. The circumstances and events regarding the possible presence of an impairment indicator are based on inputs such as, market conditions, operator performance, and legal matters. If there is an indication of possible impairment we conduct a review that is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and estimated hold period. This estimate considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends including the terminal value of the property. If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying amount of the CON, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the CON. The Company s indefinite lived intangibles consist primarily of values assigned to CON/bed licenses that are separable from the buildings. The Company does not amortize goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles. The Company's goodwill is related to certain property acquisitions but is evaluated for impairment on the operator level. On an annual basis, the Company evaluates the recoverability of the indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill by performing an impairment test. The Company performs its annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the goodwill might be impaired. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the test results indicated no impairment necessary.

to beginning in 2018. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, net operating loss NOL carry forwards generated in tax years 2018 and forward have an indefinite life. For this reason, the Company has taken the position that the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangibles can be used to support an equal amount of the deferred tax asset related to the 2018 NOL carry forward generated. Judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The Company classifies unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax balances. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The guidance removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for equity method investments, performing intra period allocation, and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The ASU also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group, among others. The Company s adoption of this new guidance had no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous state and local jurisdictions. In general, the Company s tax returns filed for the 2019 through 2022 tax years are still subject to potential examination by taxing authorities. To the Company s knowledge, the Company is not currently under examination by any major income tax jurisdiction. 

In addition, the Company maintains certain other insurance programs, including commercial general liability, property, casualty, directors and officers liability, crime, and employment practices liability.

million in unrestricted cash, including a Medicaid overpayment of million received in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company repaid on March 10, 2023 and is recorded in Accrued Expenses in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 the Company had million of accounts receivable, mainly consisting of patient account receivables, which the Company plans to collect over the next twelve months. In early 2020, the Company began on-going efforts to investigate alternatives to retire or refinance our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock through privately negotiated transactions, open market repurchases, redemptions, exchange offers, tender offers, or otherwise. Our ability to retire or refinance our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. There can be no assurance that any such alternative will be pursued or accomplished, and we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in any of these activities on desirable terms. Costs associated with these efforts have been expensed as incurred in Other expense, net and were approximately million and approximately million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Series A Preferred Dividend Suspension We suspended the quarterly dividend payment with respect to our Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter of 2017, and on June 8, 2018, the Board suspended quarterly dividend payments indefinitely with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2022, as a result of the suspension of the dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock commencing with the fourth quarter 2017 dividend period, the Company has approximately million of undeclared preferred stock dividends in arrears. The dividend suspension has provided the Company with additional funds to meet its ongoing liquidity needs. As the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock in full for more than four dividends periods, the annual dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock for the fifth and future missed dividend periods has increased to , which is equivalent to approximately per share each year, commencing on the first day after the missed fourth quarterly payment (October 1, 2018) and continuing until the second consecutive dividend payment date following such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in full in cash. Debt As of December 31, 2022, the Company had million in indebtedness, net of million deferred financing and unamortized discounts. The Company anticipates net principal repayments of approximately million during the next twelve-month period, which include approximately million of routine debt service amortization, approximately million payments on other non-routine debt and a million payment of bond debt. For further information, see Note 8 Notes Payable and Other Debt . Debt Refinance . On October 21, 2022, the Company, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, consummated a HUD refinancing of its senior mortgages on SNFs in Ohio. Funding was provided by Newpoint Real Estate Capital LLC Newpoint pursuant to three HUD guaranteed secured Healthcare Facility Notes (the HUD Notes ). Proceeds from the HUD Notes were used to pay off existing HUD guaranteed secured mortgages and pay transaction costs. Newpoint is the servicer on other loans extended to the Company. Consequently, the Company recorded a net loss of approximately million on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022, consisting of a million prepayment penalty and million of expensed deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of the Eaglewood Care Center, The Pavilion Care Center, and Hearth Care of Greenfield loans. The aggregate principal amount of the three HUD Notes is million, and the interest rate on the three HUD Notes is fixed for the full term of each HUD Note. The Northwood HUD Note has a principal amount of million and matures on . The Greenfield HUD Note has a principal amount of million and matures on . The Pavilion HUD Note has a principal amount of million and matures on . Payments of principal and interest on the HUD Notes commenced on October 1, 2022. Each HUD Note is secured by a Healthcare Deed to Secure Debt, Security Agreement and Assignment of Rents covering the facilities. Newpoint may declare the loans, accrued interest and any other amounts immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default. On September 30, 2021, the Company and the Exchange Bank of Alabama executed a million Promissory Note with a annual fixed interest rate and maturity date of (the Coosa Credit Facility ). The Coosa Credit Facility refinanced million prime + variable interest rate debt owed to Metro City Bank with a maturity date of , (the Coosa MCB Loan ). The Coosa Credit Facility is secured by the assets of the Company s subsidiary Coosa Nursing ADK, LLC Coosa which owns the -bed SNF located in Glencoe, Alabama (the Coosa Facility and the assets of the Company s subsidiary Meadowood Property Holdings, LLC Meadowood which owns the -bed assisted living facility located in Glencoe, Alabama (the Meadowood Facility ). The Company incurred approximately million in new deferred financing fees and expensed approximately million deferred financing fees associated with the Coosa MCB Loan. Consequently, the Company recorded a net gain of approximately million on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of the million gain on forgiveness of the PPP Loan partially offset by million of expensed deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of the Coosa MCB Loan. Debt Modification . In conjunction with the September 30, 2021, Coosa Facility refinance, the Company and the Exchange Bank of Alabama signed an agreement on October 1, 2021, (the Meadowood Credit Facility ), that extended the maturity date on the million Meadowood Credit Facility, as amended, in senior debt other mortgage indebtedness secured by the assets of Coosa and the assets of Meadowood, from , to . Additionally on August 17, 2021, the Company extended the maturity date on approximately million other debt from , to (known as the KeyBank Exit Notes ). For further information, see Note 8 Notes Payable and Other Debt . Debt Covenant Compliance At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the various financial and administrative covenants related to all of the Company s credit facilities. Changes in Operational Liquidity Beginning in 2021, several of the Company s operators have defaulted on their contractual obligations and elected to transition the facilities back to the Company. Given the complexities in identifying and negotiating with new operators, the Company was forced to become the licensed operator of the facilities, most importantly four of the eight leased facilities under the Foster Lease . Operating the facilities requires substantial working capital until the facilities can begin receiving the government reimbursements. Powder Springs Lease. In December 2020, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with two affiliates of Wellington. Following the Wellington Lease Termination, effective January 1, 2021, Regional leased the Powder Springs Facility to PS Operator LLC PS Operator ), an affiliate of Empire Care Center, pursuant to a sublease (the PS Sublease ). The PS sublease contained a variable lease component. For more information, please reference Note 6- Leases. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized and collected million of variable rent for the Powder Springs Facility replacing approximately million of cash rent previously anticipated from the Wellington Tenant. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized and collected .9 million in rent. Healthcare Services segment. As part of the Portfolio Stabilization initiative, the company took back facilities in 2022. In addition to becoming the licensed operator, the Company is obligated to fund the working capital needs of each facility until patient reimbursement collections begin. For the year ended 2022 and 2021, the Healthcare Services lost .5 million and million, respectively. In addition, the Account Receivable for the segment increased from million in 2021 to million in 2022. As described in more detail as referenced in Note 6 - Leases, the Company terminated the master lease. As of December 31 2022, the Company operated facilities. Evaluation of the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern Under the accounting guidance related to the presentation of financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, whether or not the entity s current financial condition, including its sources of liquidity at the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued, will enable the entity to meet its obligations as they come due within one year of the date of the issuance of the Company s consolidated financial statements and to make a determination as to whether or not it is probable, under the application of this accounting guidance, that the entity will be able to continue as a going concern. The Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In applying applicable accounting guidance, management considered the Company s current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows, the Company s obligations due over the next twelve months as well as the Company s recurring business operating expenses. The Company is able to conclude that it is probable that the Company will be able to meet its obligations arising within one year of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements within the parameters set forth in the accounting guidance.

professional and general liability actions , of which were dismissed in February 2023. The Company has legacy action from prior to the Transition, and is a named party in actions related directly to patient care that our current or prior tenants provided to their patients, subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company was named in two additional actions related directly to patient care that one of our tenants provided to their patient. For further information, see below and Note 15 Subsequent Events . Claims on behalf of the Company s Former Patients Prior to the Transition As of December 31, 2022, the Company is a defendant in professional and general liability action commenced on behalf of one of our former patients who received care at one of our facilities prior to the Transition. The plaintiff in this action alleges negligence due to failure to provide adequate and competent staff resulting in injuries, pain and suffering, mental anguish and malnutrition and seeks unspecified actual and compensatory damages, and unspecified punitive damages. This action is covered by insurance, except that any punitive damages awarded would be excluded from coverage. Claims on behalf of the Company s Prior or Current Tenant s Former Patients after the Transition As of December 31, 2022, the Company is a defendant in an aggregate of 9 professional and general liability actions which set forth claims relating to time periods after the Transition, on behalf of former patients of our current or prior tenants, of which were dismissed in January 2023, see Note 15 Subsequent Events . These actions generally seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for former patients who were allegedly injured or died due to professional negligence or understaffing at the applicable facility operated by our tenants. These actions on behalf of former patients of our current or prior tenants all relate to events which occurred after the Company transitioned the operations of the facilities in question to a third-party operator (and of which such actions relate to events which occurred after the Company sold such facilities) and are subject to such operators indemnification obligations in favor of the Company. There is no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the following professional and general liability action (included in the 9 actions mentioned above) related to our current or former tenant s former patients were filed against the Company. On June 28, 2022, Ms. Betty Coleman s husband (and executor of her estate) filed suit against Tara Operator, LLC (amongst others) alleging she received negligent care and treatment while a resident of Tara s skilled nursing facility where she was a resident from Tara at Thunderbolt Health and Rehabilitation (11/18/19-6/30/20). Although Tara Operator was served via its registered agent, due to a misunderstanding, Tara Operator did not answer the complaint timely and automatically went into default. On September 19, 2022, Tara Operator filed its proposed answer to the Complaint and its motion to set aside the default judgment. A hearing was held on that motion on October 21, 2023 at which Tara Operator argued that under Georgia s Default Statute and legal precedent, the Court had the discretion to set aside the default due to the anticipated injustice as well as inconsistent rulings should the default remain.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had consolidated federal NOL carry forwards of million. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, approximately million of NOL s generated in 2018 and after do not expire and are currently offset by a full valuation allowance. The NOLs generated before December 31, 2018, which amount to million begin to expire in 2025 through 2037 and currently are offset by a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had consolidated state NOL carry forwards of million. These NOLs begin to expire in 2023 through 2042 and currently are offset by a full valuation allowance. Given the Company s historical net operating losses, a full valuation allowance has been established on the Company s net deferred tax assets. The Company has generated additional deferred tax liabilities related to its tax amortization of certain acquired indefinite lived intangible assets because these assets are not amortized for book purposes. The tax amortization in current and future years gives rise to a deferred tax liability which will only reverse at the time of ultimate sale or book impairment. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, NOL carry forwards generated in tax years 2018 and forward have an indefinite life. For this reason, the Company has taken the position that the deferred tax liability related to the indefinite lived intangibles can be used to support an equal amount of the deferred tax asset related to the NOL carry forwards generated in tax years 2018 and forward. 

 of . The Company accepted a lump sum payment of as payoff for the remaining promissory note balance. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, enacted December 27, 2020, made a number of changes to employer retention tax credits previously made available under the CARES Act, including modifying and extending the Employee Retention Credit ERC for the six calendar months ending June 30, 2021. As a result of such legislation, the Company qualified for ERC for the first, second and third calendar quarters of 2021 due to the decrease in its gross receipts and has applied for ERC of million through amended quarterly payroll tax filings for the applicable quarters. Through the date of this filing, the Company has received all of the ERC which we applied for. We continue to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the ERC and PPP programs and developing interpretations and enforcement of the ERC and PPP program rules and the regulations. Dismissed Claims on behalf of the Company s Prior or Current Tenant s Former Patients after the Transition In February 2023, the Company was dismissed from the case involving Ronald and Sarah Ross against our prior operator Symmetry Healthcare Management. Claims on behalf of the Company s Prior or Current Tenant s Former Patients after the Transition Subsequent to year ended December 31, 2022, the Company was named in two new cases. The resident s daughter filed suit on behalf of Mr. Shellman filed suit on February 14, 2023 asserting claims of professional and ordinary negligence as well the alleged breach of various state and federal regulations. The lawsuit relates to Mr. Shellman s residence at Glenvue nursing facility which was operated by C.R. of Glenvue, LLC which is also named as a defendant. Plaintiff s counsel has agreed to extend the deadline for Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC to respond to the lawsuit up to and including May 15, 2023 to enable him to review the response filed by C.R. of Glenvue, LLC and determine whether or not Plaintiff will agree to the dismissal of Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC. If plaintiff does not agree, we intend to serve Plaintiff with a notice that Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC constitutes an excluded party pursuant to O.C.G.A. 31-7-3.3. Should Plaintiff still not agree to the dismissal of Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC, we will file a motion for summary judgment seeking judgment in its favor. The Court may require Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC to participate in discovery prior to ruling on this motion. In the event that occurs, Glenvue H R Property Holdings, LLC can seek the recovery of its attorneys fees and expenses pursuant to the above-referenced excluded party statute. The family of Mable Polite filed suit on March 15, 2023 asserting claims of professional and ordinary negligence as well the alleged breach of various state and federal regulations. The lawsuit relates to Ms. Polite s residence at the Thunderbolt nursing facility from March 19, 2020 to March 20, 2021. Plaintiff has also asserted claims against 3223 Falligant Avenue Associates, LP and other Wellington related entities. 3223 Falligant Avenue was the operator and licensee of the facility for the first part of Ms. Polite s residence prior to Tara Operator becoming the operator. Based upon the date the suit was filed, there is an argument that certain claimed acts of negligence are barred by the limitations period. Ms. Polite s daughter signed an arbitration agreement on her admission to Thunderbolt but we are not in possession of a power of attorney or other documentation authorizing her to execute this agreement. Nonetheless, Tara Operator will file its answer to the Complaint (due April 14) via special appearance to reserve the right to seek arbitration should a power of attorney be located.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period (the Evaluation Date covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report ). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this evaluation, management used the framework and criteria set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company s internal control system, including: (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication and (v) monitoring. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Pursuant to the Fox Agreement, for so long as Mr. Fox serves on the Board as a nominee of the Board, Park City shall take such action as may be required so that all of the capital stock of the Company which is entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the Voting Securities and is beneficially owned by Park City, or any person who, within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, is controlling, controlled by or under common control with Park City (the Park City Group ), is voted in favor of each of the Board s nominees to the Board at any and all meetings of our shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof or in any other circumstance in connection with which a vote, consent or other approval of holders of Voting Securities is sought with respect to the election of any nominee to the Board.

Audit Committee. The Audit Committee was established in accordance with Section 3(e)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee has the responsibility of reviewing our financial statements, evaluating internal accounting controls, reviewing reports of regulatory authorities and determining that all audits and examinations required by law are performed. The Audit Committee also approves the appointment of the independent auditors for the next fiscal year, approves the services to be provided by the independent auditors and the fees for such services, reviews and approves the auditor s audit plans, reviews and reports upon various matters affecting the independence of the independent auditors and reviews with the independent auditors the results of the audit and management s responses. The Board has determined that Mr. Taylor qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, and that he is independent for purposes of the NYSE American rules with respect to audit committee members. 
 
 Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing our compensation plans. The Compensation Committee s duties include the development with management of benefit plans for our employees and the formulation of bonus plans and incentive compensation packages. The Compensation Committee approves the compensation of each senior executive and each member of the Board. In approving the compensation of each senior executive (other than the Chief Executive Officer), the Compensation Committee may consider recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee is also charged with the oversight of compensation plans and practices for all employees of the Company. The Compensation Committee relies upon data made available for the purpose of providing information on organizations of similar or larger scale engaged in similar activities. The purpose of the Compensation Committee s activity is to assure that our resources are used appropriately to recruit and maintain competent and talented executives and employees able to operate and grow the Company successfully. 
 
 Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending to the Board qualified nominees for election as directors and qualified directors for committee membership, establishing evaluation procedures and conducting an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, developing corporate governance principles, recommending those principles to the Board and considering other matters pertaining to the size and composition of the Board. 
 
 Director Attendance at Board, Committee and Annual Shareholder Meetings 
 
 During 2022, the Board held five meetings, the Audit Committee held four meetings, the Compensation Committee held three meetings and the Nominating Committee held no meetings. Each incumbent director attended at least 
 108 

75 of the aggregate number of meetings held by the Board and by each of the committees on which he served during 2022. In addition, three of the four directors serving at that time attended the Company s 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the 2022 Annual Meeting ). Directors are expected to make reasonable efforts to attend the Company s annual meeting of shareholders. 
 Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of our common stock (the Reporting Persons to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Reporting Persons are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company and written representations from the executive officers and directors, the Company believes that the Reporting Persons complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements since January 1, 2022. 
 
 Board Structure 
 
 Our Charter and our Bylaws provide the Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. The Board does not have a policy as to whether the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined, or whether the Chairman of the Board should be a management or a non-management director. Currently, Mr. Morrison serves as the Chairman of the Board. 
 
 Mr. Fox serves as the Lead Independent Director of the Board (the Lead Independent Director ). As the primary interface between management and the Board, the Lead Independent Director serves as a key contact for the independent directors, thereby enhancing the Board s independence from management. In addition, the Lead Development Director provides a valuable counterweight to a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer role, when we have such a dual role as we have had from time to time. The Lead Independent Director s responsibilities include as applicable, among other things: 

Consulting with the Chairman of the Board (or the Chief Executive Officer, if there is no Chairman of the Board) regarding the agenda for Board meetings; 

Scheduling and preparing agendas for meetings of non-management directors; 

Presiding over meetings of non-management directors and executive sessions of meetings of the Board from which employee directors are excluded; 

Acting as principal liaison between non-management directors and the Chairman of the Board (or the Chief Executive Officer, if there is no Chairman of the Board) on sensitive issues; and 

Raising issues with management on behalf of the non-management directors when appropriate. 

The Board employs a number of corporate governance measures to provide an appropriate balance between the respective needs for the operational and strategic leadership provided by management directors, on one hand, and the oversight and objectivity of independent directors, on the other. These corporate governance measures include having a Lead Independent Director with the responsibilities described above, having all of our standing Board committees consist entirely of independent directors, and having each independent director serve on Board committees. Further: (i) all directors play an active role in overseeing the Company s business both at the Board and committee levels; (ii) directors have full and free access to members of management; and (iii) each of the Board committees has the authority to retain independent financial, legal or other experts as it deems necessary. Also, the Lead Independent Director holds separate executive sessions of non-management directors and independent directors as he deems necessary. 

Director Nomination Process 
 109 

With respect to the director nomination process, the Nominating Committee s responsibilities include reviewing the size and overall composition of the Board and recommending changes to the Board; identifying and recommending to the Board qualified individuals to become Board members; making recommendations to the Board with respect to retirement arrangements or policies for Board members; monitoring and reviewing any issues relating to the independence of directors; considering director candidates recommended by shareholders; assisting the Board in developing processes and procedures for evaluating Board nominees recommended by shareholders; and recommending to the Board individuals qualified to fill vacancies. 
 
 The Nominating Committee has not established specific minimum age, education, years of business experience or specific types of skills for potential director candidates but, in general, expects qualified candidates will have ample experience and a proven record of business success and leadership. Director candidates will be evaluated based on their financial literacy, business acumen and experience, independence for purposes of compliance with SEC rules and the NYSE American listing standards and their willingness, ability and availability for service, as well as other criteria established by the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee believes that continuity in leadership maximizes the Board s ability to exercise meaningful oversight. Because qualified incumbent directors are generally uniquely positioned to provide shareholders the benefit of continuity of leadership and seasoned judgment gained through experience as a director, the Nominating Committee will generally consider as potential candidates those incumbent directors interested in standing for re-election who they believe have satisfied director performance expectations, including regular attendance at, preparation for and meaningful participation in meetings of the Board and its committees. 
 
 The Nominating Committee will consider the recommendations of shareholders regarding potential director candidates. Any shareholder who wishes to have the Nominating Committee consider a candidate for election by the Board is required to give written notice of his or her intention to make such a nomination. Our Bylaws set forth the procedures required to be followed for a shareholder to nominate a potential director candidate. A proposed nomination that does not comply with these procedures will not be considered by the Nominating Committee. There are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating Committee considers or evaluates director candidates it identifies and director candidates who are recommended by shareholders. 
 
 Board Diversity 
 
 The Nominating Committee has not adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. In determining whether to recommend a director nominee, the members of the Nominating Committee will consider and discuss diversity, among other factors, with a view toward the role and needs of the Board as a whole. When identifying and recommending director nominees, the members of the Nominating Committee generally will view diversity expansively to include, without limitation, concepts such as race, gender, national origin, differences of viewpoint and perspective, professional experience, education, skill and other qualities or attributes that together contribute to the functioning of the Board. The Nominating Committee believes that the inclusion of diversity as one of many factors considered in selecting director nominees is consistent with the goal of creating a Board that best serves the needs of the Company and its shareholders. 
 
 Risk Oversight 
 
 The Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance shareholder value. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of the full Board in setting our business strategy is a key part of the Board s risk oversight and method for determining what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for us. Risk is assessed throughout the business, focusing on three primary areas of risk: financial risk, legal/compliance risk and operational/strategic risk. 
 
 While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibility for risk management. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk, 
 110 

including internal controls, and receives an annual risk assessment report from an outside consultant. The Nominating Committee s risk oversight responsibilities include recommending qualified nominees to be elected to the Board by our shareholders, reviewing and assessing periodically our policies and practices on corporate governance, and overseeing an annual evaluation of the Board. In addition, in setting compensation, the Compensation Committee strives to create a combination of short-term and longer-term incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with our business strategy. 
 
 Code of Ethics 
 
 We have adopted a written code of conduct, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is applicable to all our directors, officers and employees (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal caccounting officer or controller, and any person performing similar functions). Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available in the corporate governance subsection of the Investor Relations page of our website at www.regionalhealthproperties.com and also may be obtained, without charge, by contacting the Corporate Secretary, Regional Health Properties, Inc., 454 Satellite Boulevard NW, Suite 100, Suwanee, Georgia 30024. 
 
 Insider Trading Policy and Hedging 
 
 We have adopted an Insider Trading Policy which, among other things, prohibits our officers, directors and employees from trading our securities on a short-term basis, purchasing our securities on margin, engaging in short sales with respect to our securities, and buying or selling puts or calls with respect to our securities. We have not otherwise adopted any practices or policies regarding the ability of our officers, directors and employees to purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds), or otherwise engage in transactions, that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in the market value of our equity securities. 
 
 Communication with the Board and its Committees 
 
 The Board welcomes communications from shareholders and interested parties. Shareholders and interested parties may send communications to the Board, any of its committees or one or more individual directors, in care of the Corporate Secretary, Regional Health Properties, Inc., 454 Satellite Boulevard NW, Suite 100, Suwanee, Georgia 30024. Any correspondence addressed to the Board, any of its committees or to any one of our directors in care of our offices will be forwarded to the addressee without review by management.

Compensation Arrangements With Executive Officer 
 
 Mr. Morrison . Mr. Morrison, a director of the Company since October 2014, commenced serving as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President (and principal executive officer) on March 25, 2019 and Corporate Secretary on December 30, 2022, and served as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President (and principal executive officer) from October 18, 2017 to March 24, 2019. 
 
 On November 17, 2017, the Board and the Compensation Committee of the Board agreed to provide Mr. Morrison, as compensation for his service as a non-employee Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President, a cash payment in the amount of 15,000 per month, without withholdings, payable on a date to be determined by Mr. Morrison, as well as reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Mr. Morrison in connection with the performance of his duties as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim President. 
 
 On March 25, 2019, upon the Board s appointment of Mr. Morrison as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President, the Board and the Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Morrison s then-current compensation 
 113 

plan would remain place, with withholdings as an employee, until the Company negotiated and executed an employment agreement with Mr. Morrison. 
 
 On June 3, 2019, the Board approved a one-time bonus equal to three months of his current salary in the amount of 45,000 paid upon the closing of the sale of four healthcare properties to MED Healthcare Partners, LLC and upon repayment of the amounts owed to Pinecone Reality Partners II, LLC. 
 
 On July 1, 2021, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Morrison (the Morrison Employment Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other things: (i) the Company agreed to pay Mr. Morrison 220,000 per year, subject to increase by the Compensation Committee; (ii) Mr. Morrison is eligible to earn an annual bonus based on achievement of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee of up to 125 of his base salary; and (iii) the Company provides Mr. Morrison with such other benefits as other senior executives of the Company receive. Pursuant to the Morrison Employment Agreement, the Company agreed to employ Mr. Morrison for an initial term of three years. 
 
 Pursuant to the Morrison Employment Agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Morrison, subject to the 2020 Plan (as defined herein): (i) on July 1, 2021, a restricted stock award of 24,000 shares of common stock, which vests in three equal installments on January 1, 2022, January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024; (ii) on January 1, 2022, a restricted stock award of 24,000 shares of common stock, which vests in two equal installments on January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024; and (iii) on January 1, 2023, an option to purchase 24,000 shares of common stock, which vests immediately on the grant date. Pursuant to the Morrison Employment Agreement, the Company agreed to grant Mr. Morrison, subject to the 2020 Plan, on January 1, 2024, an option to purchase 24,000 shares of common stock, which will vest immediately on the grant date. The exercise price per share for the common stock subject to each option shall equal the Fair Market Value (as defined in the 2020 Plan) of a share of common stock on the respective dates of grant, unless the 2020 Plan requires a higher exercise price. 
 
 Pursuant to the Morrison Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Morrison s employment for any reason, the Company will pay Mr. Morrison: (i) unpaid salary earned through his termination date; (ii) any vacation time earned but not used as of his termination date in accordance with the Company s policies as then in effect; (iii) reimbursement, in accordance with the Company s policies and procedures, for business expenses incurred but not yet paid as of his termination date; (iv) except in the case of termination for cause, any annual bonus for any completed fiscal year to the extent not yet paid and earned; and (v) all other payments, benefits or fringe benefits to which he is entitled under the terms of the applicable arrangements and/or under applicable law (all of the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), the Accrued Obligations ).

 If Mr. Morrison is terminated without cause, then (i) Mr. Morrison will be entitled to (a) the Accrued Obligations and (b) a severance payment equal to six months salary plus a bonus of 100 of Mr. Morrison s salary for any completed fiscal year to the extent earned but not paid, (ii) to the extent Mr. Morrison participates in Company health programs, the Company will pay Mr. Morrison an amount in cash, on a monthly basis, equal to the Company s portion of the premiums for Mr. Morrison s health plan benefits for Mr. Morrison and any eligible dependents for a period of 12 months from his termination date, and (iii) equity awards shall automatically accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable as of his termination date. If Mr. Morrison is terminated without cause within one year following a change in control, the severance will be increased from six months salary to twelve months salary.

Compensation Arrangements With Former Executive Officer 
 
 Benjamin A. Waites . Mr. Waites relinquished his duties and responsibilities for the Company effective March 21, 2022, after serving as the Company s Chief Financial Officer since September 8, 2020. Pursuant to a Separation and Release of Claims Agreement executed June 13, 2022 (the Waites Separation Agreement ), the Company agreed to pay Mr. Waites: (i) salary and benefits through March 31, 2022, including the payout of any earned but unused paid time off in accordance with the Company s usual policy and procedures; (ii) three months of base salary in accordance with the Company s regular payroll practices; and (iii) a final additional payment of 24,000 within 30 days following the last base salary payment, subject to Mr. Waites compliance with the provisions of the Separation Agreement. Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Waites agreed: (i) for a period of three months, to cooperate with the Company regarding matters arising out or, of related to, Mr. Waites service to the Company; and (ii) to customary confidentiality and non-disparagement covenants. Except as set forth in the Separation Agreement, Mr. Waites is not entitled to any further compensation or benefits.

Unearned awards were forfeited upon Mr. Waites separation . 
 
 2020 Equity Incentive Plan 
 
 The Board believes that stock-based incentive awards can play an important role in our success by encouraging and enabling our employees, directors and consultants upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts we largely depend for the successful conduct of our business to acquire a proprietary interest in us. The Board believes that providing such persons with a direct stake in us assures a closer identification of the interests of such individuals with ours and our shareholders, thereby stimulating their efforts on our behalf and strengthening their desire to remain with us. 
 
 On November 4, 2020, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Regional Health Properties, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ). On December 16, 2020, at the Company s 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company s shareholders approved the 2020 Plan. The 2020 Plan is designed to enhance the flexibility to grant equity awards to our employees, directors and consultants and to ensure that we can continue to grant equity awards to eligible recipients at levels determined to be appropriate by the Compensation Committee. 
 
 Summary of the 2020 Plan 
 
 The following description of certain features of the 2020 Plan is intended to be a summary only. The summary does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the 2020 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2020 Plan, which is filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part. 
 
 Administration . The 2020 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has full power, subject to the provisions of the 2020 Plan, to: (i) select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted; (ii) make any combination of awards to participants; (iii) determine the type of awards; and (iv) determine the specific terms and conditions of each award. 
 
 Eligibility; Plan Limits . All employees and non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan as well as consultants who are natural persons and are designated as eligible by the Compensation Committee. As of October 8, 2020, approximately 22 individuals would have been eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan had it been effective on such date, including two executive officers, 14 employees who are not executive officers, three non-employee directors and three consultants. There are certain limits on the number of awards that may be granted under the 2020 Plan. For example, awards with respect to no more than 24,000 shares of common stock may be granted to any individual in any one calendar year, and no more than 250,000 shares of common stock may be granted in the form of incentive stock options. 
 
 115 

Director Compensation Limit . The 2020 Plan provides that the value of all awards under the 2020 Plan and all other cash compensation paid by us to any non-employee director in any calendar year shall not exceed 75,000. 
 
 Stock Options . The 2020 Plan permits the granting of: (i) options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, and (ii) options that do not so qualify. Options granted under the 2020 Plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on incentive stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options and to all other eligible participants in the 2020 Plan. The option exercise price of each option will be determined by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price may not be less than 100 of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Fair market value for this purpose shall be the closing sales price of the common stock as quoted on the NYSE American, or if the closing sales price is not quoted on such date of determination, the closing sales price on the last preceding date for which such quotation exists. The exercise price of an option may not be reduced after the date of the option grant without shareholder approval, other than to appropriately reflect changes in our capital structure. 
 
 The term of each option will be fixed by the Compensation Committee and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised. In general, unless otherwise permitted by the Compensation Committee, no option granted under the 2020 Plan is transferable by the optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and options may be exercised during the optionee s lifetime only by the optionee. 
 
 Upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full: (i) in cash or by certified check; (ii) by delivery of shares of common stock having a value equal to the exercise price; (iii) by broker-assisted exercise; (iv) with respect to stock options that are not incentive stock options, by a net exercise arrangement, pursuant to which the number of shares issued upon exercise is reduced by a number of shares with a fair market value equal to the exercise price; or (iv) by any other means approved by the Compensation Committee consistent with applicable law. 
 
 To qualify as incentive options, options must meet additional federal tax requirements, including a 100,000 limit on the value of shares subject to incentive options that first become exercisable by a participant in any one calendar year. 
 
 Restricted Common Stock . The Compensation Committee may award shares of common stock to participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain Company and individual performance goals and/or continued employment or other service with the Company through a specified restricted period. 
 
 Restricted Stock Units . The Compensation Committee may award restricted stock units to participants. Restricted stock units are ultimately payable in the form of shares of common stock, subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment or other service with the Company through a specified vesting period. 
 
 Deferred Stock Units . The Compensation Committee may award deferred stock units to participants. Deferred stock units are ultimately payable in the form of shares of common stock, generally at a later date elected by the participant. 
 
 Stock Appreciation Rights . The Compensation Committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. Stock appreciation rights entitle the recipient to cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof equal to the value of the appreciation in the stock price over the base price. The base price of a stock appreciation right that is granted in tandem with a stock option will be equal to the exercise price of such stock option and the base price of a stock appreciation right that is not granted in tandem with a stock option may not be less than 100 of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. 
 
 Performance Units . The Compensation Committee may grant performance units, which entitle a participant to cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two upon the achievement of certain performance criteria. 
 
 116 

Other Stock-Based Awards . The Compensation Committee may grant other awards denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based upon or related to common stock or other equity interests of the Company (or a Company subsidiary or operating partnership, if applicable). 
 
 Certain Corporate Events . The Compensation Committee has broad discretion to take action under the 2020 Plan, as well as to make adjustments to the number and kind of shares issuable under the 2020 Plan and the terms, conditions and exercise price (if any) of existing and future awards, to prevent the dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting the common stock, such as stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and other corporate transactions. 
 
 In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions between the Company and our shareholders known as equity restructurings, the Compensation Committee will make equitable adjustments to the 2020 Plan and outstanding awards. 
 
 In the event of a change-in-control (as defined in the 2020 Plan), and except as may be otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, to the extent that the surviving entity declines to assume or replace outstanding awards, then all such outstanding awards will become fully vested and exercisable in connection with the transaction, all forfeiture and other restrictions with respect to such awards will lapse, and all performance goals with respect to such awards will be deemed met to the extent provided in the participant s award agreement or any other written agreement entered into between us and the participant. Upon or in anticipation of a change-in-control in which outstanding awards will not be replaced or assumed by the surviving entity, the Compensation Committee may cause any outstanding awards to terminate at a specified time in the future, including, but not limited to, the date of such change-in-control, and will and give the participant the right to exercise such awards during a period of time determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. 
 
 Tax Withholding . Participants in the 2020 Plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that we are required by law to withhold upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or vesting of other awards. The Compensation Committee may require awards to be subject to mandatory share withholding up to the required withholding amount. The Compensation Committee may also require the tax withholding obligation to be satisfied by a sell to cover arrangement. 
 
 Amendments and Termination . The Board or the Compensation Committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the 2020 Plan; provided, however, no such action of the Board or the Committee may be taken without shareholder approval if such action would otherwise require shareholder approval under applicable law, including the rules of the NYSE American. Additionally, no amendment, suspension or termination of the 2020 Plan may impair any rights or obligations under any outstanding award without the participant s consent. Under the rules of the NYSE American, any amendments that materially increase the number of shares to be issued under the 2020 Plan, materially increase the benefits to the participants in the 2020 Plan, materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan, or expand the types of options or awards provided under the 2020 Plan, will be subject to approval by our shareholders. 
 
 Effective Date of Plan . The 2020 Plan was approved by our Board on November 4, 2020 and became effective on December 16, 2020, the date on which it was approved by our shareholders. 
 
 Tax Aspects Under the Code 
 
 The following is a summary of the principal federal income tax consequences of certain transactions under the 2020 Plan. It does not describe all federal tax consequences under the 2020 Plan, nor does it describe state or local tax consequences. 
 
 Incentive Options . No taxable income is generally realized by the optionee upon the grant or exercise of an incentive option. If shares of common stock issued to an optionee pursuant to the exercise of an incentive option are sold or transferred after two years from the date of grant and after one year from the date of exercise, then: (i) upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price (the amount paid for the shares) will be taxed to the optionee as a long-term capital gain, and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss; and (ii) we will not be 
 117 

entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. The exercise of an incentive option will give rise to an item of tax preference that may result in alternative minimum tax liability for the optionee. 
 
 If shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of an incentive option are disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-year and one-year holding periods described above (a disqualifying disposition ), generally: (i) the optionee will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the shares of common stock at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on a sale of such shares of common stock) over the exercise price thereof; and (ii) we will be entitled to deduct such amount. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the incentive option is paid by tendering shares of common stock. 
 
 If an incentive option is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies for the tax treatment described above, then the option is treated as a non-qualified option. Generally, an incentive option will not be eligible for the tax treatment described above if it is exercised more than three months following termination of employment (or one year in the case of termination of employment by reason of disability). In the case of termination of employment by reason of death, the three-month rule does not apply. 
 
 Non-Qualified Options . No income is realized by the optionee at the time a non-qualified option is granted. Generally: (i) at exercise, ordinary income is realized by the optionee in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of exercise, and we receive a tax deduction for the same amount; and (ii) at disposition, appreciation or depreciation after the date of exercise is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending on how long the shares of common stock have been held. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the non-qualified option is paid by tendering shares of common stock. Upon exercise, the optionee will also be subject to social security taxes on the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the option. 
 
 Other Awards . We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with other awards under the 2020 Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by the participant at the time the participant recognizes such income. Participants typically are subject to income tax and recognize such tax at the time that an award is exercised, vests or becomes non-forfeitable, unless the award provides for a further deferral. 
 
 Parachute Payments . The vesting of any portion of an award that is accelerated due to the occurrence of a change in control may cause a portion of the payments with respect to such accelerated awards to be treated as parachute payments as defined in the Code. Any such parachute payments may be non-deductible by us, in whole or in part, and may subject the recipient to a non-deductible 20 federal excise tax on all or a portion of such payment (in addition to other taxes ordinarily payable).

 For a description of arrangements with Mr. Fox (a director of the Company), see Arrangements with Directors Regarding Election/Appointment in Part III, Item 10 . Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance in this Annual Report. 
 Approval of Related Party Transactions 
 The foregoing transaction was approved by the independent members of the Board without the related party having input with respect to the discussion of such approval. In addition, the Board believes that the foregoing transaction was necessary for the Company s business and is on terms no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from independent third parties. The Company s policy requiring that independent directors approve any related party transaction is not evidenced by writing but has been the Company s consistent practice. 
 122 

Director Independence 
 The NYSE American listing standards require that at least 50 of the members of a listed company s board of directors qualify as independent, as defined under NYSE American rules and as affirmatively determined by the Board. After review of all the relevant transactions and relationships between each director (and his family members) and the Company, senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board affirmatively determined that at all times during the year ended December 31, 2022, and through the date of filing this Annual Report, each of Messrs. Fox, Grossman, Martin, Taylor and Tenwick was independent within the meaning of applicable NYSE American rules. 
 For purposes of determining the independence of Mr. Fox, the Board considered the Fox Agreement. See Arrangements with Directors Regarding Election/Appointment in Part III, Item 10 . - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance in this Annual Report. 
 
 For purposes of determining the independence of Mr. Grossman and Mr. Martin, the Board considered the relationships described under Related Party Transactions above.

 WI T NE S S E T H: 
 
 WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant are parties to that certain lease dated September 22, 2104 (the Lease ), whereby Tenant leased certain improved property located at 513 Pine View Avenue, Glencoe, Alabama 35905; and 
 
 WHEREAS, Landlord and Tenant desire to amend the Lease as hereinafter set forth. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100 Dollars 10.00) and other good and valuable consideration, paid by each party to the other, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and the mutual covenants and benefits flowing between the parties, Landlord and Tenant, intending to be legally bound, do hereby covenant and agree as follows: 
 
 1. Capitalized Terms. 	Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized words and phrases used herein shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Lease. 

2. Amendment. 	Section 3 of the Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is inserted in lieu thereof: 

3. Security Deposit. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord and maintain during the Term the cash sum of Seventy-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars 75,000.00) as a security deposit (the Security Deposit which Landlord shall hold as security for the full and faithful performance by Tenant of every term, provision, obligation and covenant under this Lease and subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease. The Security Deposit shall be paid to Landlord in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 12,500.00 on November 21, 2014 and (ii) 12,500.00 on the first day of each month thereafter commencing on December 1, 2014 until paid in full. The Security Deposit may be deposited by Landlord into an interest-bearing account, which interest shall accrue for the sole benefit of Landlord and not Tenant. The Security Deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of Rent (or of any other sum payable by Tenant under this Lease) or a measure of Landlord's damages in case of a default by Tenant. The Security Deposit shall not be considered a trust fund, and Tenant expressly acknowledges and agrees that Landlord is not acting as a trustee or in any fiduciary capacity in controlling or using the Security Deposit. Landlord shall have no obligation to maintain the Security Deposit separate and apart from Landlord's general and/or other funds. If Tenant defaults in respect of any of the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease (or if there is a default under any agreement or instrument with 

HNZW/484137 _l .doc/3583-1 
 
 which this Lease is cross-defaulted), Landlord may, but shall not be required to, in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights and remedies available to Landlord, apply all or any part of the Security Deposit to the payment of any sum in default, or any other sum that Landlord may expend or be required to expend by reason of Tenant's default, including but not limited to, any damages or deficiency in reletting the Premises. Whenever, and as often as, Landlord has applied any portion of the Security Deposit to cure Tenant's default hereunder or under any agreement with which this Lease is cross defaulted, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after Notice from Landlord, deposit additional money with Landlord sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to the full amount then required to be deposited with Landlord, and Tenant's failure to do so shall constitute an Event of Default without any further Notice. If Landlord transfers or assigns its interest under this Lease, Landlord shall assign the Security Deposit to the new landlord and thereafter Landlord shall have no further liability for the return of the Security Deposit, and Tenant agrees to look solely to the new landlord for the return of the Security Deposit. Tenant agrees that it will not assign or encumber or attempt to assign or encumber the Security Deposit and that Landlord, its successors and assigns may return the Security Deposit to the last tenant in possession of the Premises at the last address for which Notice has given by such tenant and that Landlord thereafter shall be relieved of any liability therefor, regardless of one or more assignments of this Lease or any such actual or attempted assignment or encumbrances of the Security Deposit 
 
 3. Agreement in Effect. Except as herein specifically provided, all other terms and provisions of the Lease shall remain in full force and effect, and are hereby ratified and reaffirmed by the parties.
