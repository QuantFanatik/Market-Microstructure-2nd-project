Business
Overview 

Ozop
Energy Systems 

OES
was formed to be a distributor of renewable energy products and is actively engaged in the renewable, electric vehicle EV ),
energy storage and energy resiliency sectors. OES management has decades of experience in the renewable, storage and resilient energy
businesses and associated markets, which include but are not limited to project finance, project development, equipment finance, construction,
utility protocol, regulatory policy and technology assessment. 

We
are engaged in multiple business lines that include Project Development as well as Equipment Distribution. Our solar and energy storage
projects involve large-scale battery and solar photovoltaics (PV) installations. The utility-scale storage business is based on an arbitrage
business model in which we install multiple 1+ megawatt batteries, charge them with off-peak grid electricity under contract with the
utility, then sell the power back during peak load hours at a premium, as dictated by prevailing electricity tariffs. 

6 

Equipment
Distributor: OES has entered the component supply/distribution side of the renewable, resiliency and energy storage industries
distributing the core components associated with residential and commercial solar PV systems as well as onsite battery storage and power
generation. In April 2021, the Company signed a five- year lease (beginning June 1, 2021) of approximately 8,100 SF in California, for
office and warehouse space to support the sales and distribution of our west coast operations. The components we are distributing include
PV panels, solar inverters, solar mounting systems, stationary batteries, onsite generators and other associated electrical equipment
and components that are all manufactured by multiple companies, both domestic and international. These core products are sourced from
management-developed relationships and are distributed through our existing network and our in-house sales team. 

Solar
PV: Our PV business model involves the design and construction of electrical generating PV systems that can sell power to the
utilities or be used for off grid use as part of our developing Neo-Grids solution. The Neo-Grids proprietary program, patents pending,
was developed for the off-grid distribution of electricity to remove or reduce the dependency on utilities that currently burdens the
EV Charging sectors. It will also reduce or eliminate the lengthy permitting processes and streamline the installations of those EV chargers. 

Modular
Energy Distribution System: The Neo-Grid TM System patent pending, consists of the design, engineering, installation,
and operational methodologies as well as the financial arbitrage of how we produce, capture and distribute electrical energy for the
EV markets. OES has acquired through a license the rights to a proprietary system, the Neo-Grids TM System (patent pending),
for the capture and distribution of electrical energy for the EV market. The Neo-Grids TM System will serve both the
private auto and the commercial sectors. The exponential growth of the EV industry has been accelerated by the recent major commitments
of most of the major car manufacturers. Our Neo-Grids TM System leverages this accelerated growth by offering (1) charging
locations that can be rapidly installed in restricted areas or load limits and (2) EV charger electricity that is produced from renewable
sources having little to no carbon footprint. 

OES
has developed a business plan for the Neo Grid TM distribution system, a solution to alleviate the stress on the existing grid-tied
infrastructure. The Company has completed its Neo Grid TM research and development as well as the first stage that includes
the specifications and engineered technical drawings. This completion of the first stage of allows us to move forward with stage two,
as well as to begin to construct the first prototype or proof of concept, PoC ). Our PoC design is partially reliant on
auto manufacturers establishing standardizations of the actual charging/discharging protocols of the batteries such as on-board inverters
as well as bi-directional capabilities in electric vehicles, which have only recently been established. As the market growth rate of
EV s continues to rise, the stress on the existing grid-tied infrastructure shows the need for the continued development of our
Neo-Grid TM System as a viable solution. 

Ozop
Plus 

On
August 19, 2021, the Company formed Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. Ozop Capital ), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. On October 29, 2021, EV Insurance Company, Inc. EVCO was formed as a captive insurer that
reinsures in the State of Delaware. EVCO (DBA OZOP Plus is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ozop Capital. EVCO has agreements
with others whereby the battery premium associated with any EV VSC will be ceded to EVCO. Ozop Plus markets vehicle service contracts VSC s for electric vehicles (EV s) that offer consumers to be able to purchase additional months and miles
above the manufacturer s warranty and to also bring added value to EV owners by utilizing our partnerships and strengths in the
energy market to offer unique and innovative services. Among EV owners concerns are the EV battery repair and replacement costs,
range anxiety, environmental responsibilities, roadside assistance, and the accelerated wear on additional components that EV vehicles
experience. Management believes that the Ozop Plus marketed VSC s will give peace of mind to the EV buyer. 

Ozop
Engineering and Design 

OED
was formed to become a premier engineering and lighting control design firm. OED offers product and design support for lighting and solar
projects with a focus on fast lead times and technical support. OED and our partners are able to offer the resources needed for lighting,
solar and electrical design projects. OED provides its customers systems to coordinate the understanding of electrical usage with
the relationship between lighting design and lighting controls, by developing more efficient ecofriendly designs by working with architects,
engineers, facility managers, electrical contractors and engineers. 

7 

Sales
and marketing 

The
Company markets its products through its websites as well as attending industry specific trade shows. Additionally, Ozop Plus markets
the EV VSC in conjunction with Royal Administration Services, Inc. Royal through Royal s agents and the Company
also will begin marketing the product through various third-party websites and portals for additional direct to consumer marketing to
EV owners. In April 2023, OED began marketing its maintenance and support contract program, named Ozop Secure to existing customers
as well as through other distributors. 

Competition 

We
compete with many companies in the various application segments including larger, more established companies with substantial capabilities,
personnel and financial resources. Many of our competitors have a larger presence in global markets. 

Employees 

As
of the date of this filing, the Company employs 9 full time employees. Ozop also has contracts with various independent contractors and
consultants to fulfill additional needs, including accounting, investor relations, business development, permitting, and other corporate
functions, and may increase staff further as we expand activities and bring new projects online.

THE
COMPANY 

Ozop
Energy Solutions, Inc. (the Company, we, us or our was originally incorporated
as Newmarkt Corp. on July 17, 2015, under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

On
December 11, 2020, the Company formed Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. OES ), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. OES was formed to be a manufacturer and distributor of renewable energy products. 

On
October 29, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Ozop Surgical Name Change Subsidiary, Inc., a Nevada corporation Merger Sub ). The Merger Sub was formed under the Nevada Revised Statutes for the sole purpose and effect of changing the
Company s name to Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. That same day the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the Merger Agreement with the Merger Sub and filed Articles of Merger (the Articles of Merger with the
Nevada Secretary of State, merging the Merger Sub into the Company, which were stamped effective as of November 3, 2020. As permitted
by the Section 92.A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose and effect of the filing of Articles of Merger was to change
the name of the Company from Ozop Surgical Corp. to Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. 

On
August 19, 2021, the Company formed Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. Ozop Capital ), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, and was formed as a holding company. On October 29, 2021, EV Insurance Company, Inc. EVCO was formed as a captive insurer that reinsures in the State of Delaware. EVCO (DBA OZOP Plus is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Ozop Capital. 

OES
is actively engaged in the renewable, electric vehicle EV ), energy storage and energy resiliency sectors. We are engaged
in multiple business lines that include project development as well as equipment distribution. Our solar and energy storage projects
involve large-scale battery and solar photovoltaics (PV) installations. Our utility-scale storage business model is based on an arbitrage
business model in which we install multiple 1+ megawatt batteries, charge them with off-peak grid electricity under contract with the
utility, then sell the power back during peak load hours at a premium, as dictated by prevailing electricity tariffs. 

10 

Equipment
Distributor: OES has entered the component supply/distribution side of the renewable, resiliency and energy storage industries
distributing the core components associated with residential and commercial solar PV systems as well as onsite battery storage and power
generation. In April 2021, the Company signed a five- year lease (beginning June 1, 2021) of approximately 8,100 SF in California, for
office and warehouse space to support the sales and distribution of our west coast operations. The components we are distributing include
PV panels, solar inverters, solar mounting systems, stationary batteries, onsite generators and other associated electrical equipment
and components that are all manufactured by multiple companies, both domestic and international. These core products are sourced from
management-developed relationships and are distributed through our existing network and our in-house sales team. 

Solar
PV: Our PV business model involves the design and construction of electrical generating PV systems that can sell power to the
utilities or be used for off grid use as part of our developing Neo-Grids solution. The Neo-Grid TM System, patent pending,
was developed for the off-grid distribution of electricity to remove or reduce the dependency on utilities that currently burdens the
EV Charging sectors. It will also reduce or eliminate the lengthy permitting processes and streamline the installations of those EV chargers. 

Modular
Energy Distribution System: The Neo-Grid TM System patent pending, consists of the design, engineering, installation,
and operational methodologies as well as the financial arbitrage of how we produce, capture and distribute electrical energy for the
EV markets. OES has acquired through a license the rights to a proprietary system, the Neo-Grids TM System (patent pending),
for the capture and distribution of electrical energy for the EV market. The Neo-Grids TM System will serve both the
private auto and the commercial sectors. The exponential growth of the EV industry has been accelerated by the recent major commitments
of most of the major car manufacturers. Our Neo-Grids TM System leverages this accelerated growth by offering (1) charging
locations that can be rapidly installed in restricted areas or load limits and (2) EV charger electricity that is produced from renewable
sources having little to no carbon footprint. 

OES
has developed a business plan for the Neo Grid TM distribution system, a solution to alleviate the stress on the existing grid-tied
infrastructure. The Company has completed its Neo Grid TM research and development as well as the first stage that includes
the specifications and engineered technical drawings. This completion of the first stage of allows us to move forward with stage two,
as well as to begin to construct the first prototype or proof of concept, PoC ). Our PoC design is partially reliant on
auto manufacturers establishing standardizations of the actual charging/discharging protocols of the batteries such as on-board inverters
as well as bi-directional capabilities in electric vehicles, which have only recently been established. As the market growth rate of
EV s continues to rise, the stress on the existing grid-tied infrastructure shows the need for the continued development of our
Neo-Grid TM System as a viable solution. 

OES
management has decades of experience in the renewable, storage and resilient energy businesses and associated markets, which include
but are not limited to project finance, project development, equipment finance, construction, utility protocol, regulatory policy and
technology assessment. 

Ozop
Plus markets vehicle service contracts VSC s for electric vehicles (EV s) that offer consumers to be able
to purchase additional months and miles above the manufacturer s warranty and to also bring added value to EV owners by utilizing
our partnerships and strengths in the energy market to offer unique and innovative services. Among EV owners concerns are the
EV battery repair and replacement costs, range anxiety, environmental responsibilities, roadside assistance, and the accelerated wear
on additional components that EV vehicles experience. Management believes that the Ozop Plus marketed VSC s will give peace
of mind to the EV buyer. 

In
 May 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with GS Administrators, Inc., a member of Houston-based GSFSGroup. Under the agreement,
 the Company will market GSFSGroup s EV VSC s in all states (except, California, Florida, Massachusetts and Washington)
 to Ozop s network of new and used franchised dealerships and other eligible entities. In addition to acting as an agent for
 the marketing, Ozop also has the right to white label the product under its Ozop Plus brand. Ozop s role won t
 be limited to marketing the product. GSFSGroup plans to tap into Ozop s experience relative to battery collection and disposal
 and has agreed to insurance risk sharing in connection with the insurance policies that back the VSC s. GSFSGroup is working
 on getting the approvals needed for the above four (4) states. 

11 

On
 June 22, 2022, the Company entered into an Agent Agreement with Royal Administration Services, Inc. Royal ). Under
 the agreement, the Company will market Royal s EV VSC s and has the right to white label it under Ozop Plus. Royal has
 agreed to allow Ozop Plus on all VSC s, marketed by Royal and the Company, to assume all the risk related to the electric battery
 at an agreed upon premium. The battery premium is dependent on the consumer s selection of the duration of the VSC, the miles
 selected for coverage and the type of vehicle that the consumer has purchased, with a key component being the kWh size of the battery.
 These VSC s have a maximum of 10 years and 150,000 miles and cover new and used cars from model year 2017 and newer. Royal s
 VSCs are now effective in 46 states and the others have various waiting times or approvals needed. 

On
 October 13, 2022, EVCO entered a Reinsurance Contract (the Contract with American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida
 ABIC or the Ceding Company ). Royal is the Administrator of the Contract. Pursuant to the terms of the
 Contract, ABIC will cede 100 of the battery coverage portion of all electric vehicle service contracts to EVCO. On the same date
 ABIC and EVCO also entered into a Trust Agreement, whereas EVCO as the reinsurer agrees to deposit an amount equal to unearned premium
 reserves, plus losses reported but unpaid, plus the estimated amount of losses incurred but not reported to the trust account. Permissible
 investments (with a maturity of no more than five (5) years) of the assets of the Trust account include:

As
it did for most of the solar industry; OES s importing of solar panels issues that began in the 4 th quarter of 2021,
continued during 2022. Covid issues continued to be disruptive to a continual source of product from foreign manufacturers as well as
ocean freight backlogs and covid issues that plagued the port of arrivals related to the unloading of containers and the eventual customs
clearance of the imported goods. An announcement by the U.S. Department in March 2022 stated it would investigate allegations that solar
panel manufacturers in Southeast Asia are using Chinese-made parts and evading U.S. tariffs has raised alarms concerning both trade and
environmental policy The department announced March 28 that it would investigate claims by California-based solar panel manufacturer
that solar energy equipment manufacturers in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have close business ties to companies in China
that produce the raw materials and some components of solar panel assemblies. On June 6, 2022, President Biden waived tariffs on solar
panels from four Southeast Asian nations for two years and invoked the Defense Production Act to spur domestic solar panel manufacturing
at home. The tariff exemption will serve as a bridge while U.S. manufacturing ramps up. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had inventory of approximately 3,601,000 of which approximately 3,092,000 are solar panels. As of
the date of this report the Company also has outstanding purchase orders with its panel supplier of 14,393,000 and has paid deposits
of approximately 3,908,000 towards these open purchase orders. In order to meet our current customers anticipated needs for 2023, the
Company would need to purchase approximately an additional 5,000,000 to be received in Q4/2023. Based on the above, management anticipates
revenues may approach 20 million for 2023 for solar products. 

Cost
of sales 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized 15,281,791 and 9,763,943, respectively, of cost of sales.

Based
on the above cost of sales, gross margin was 8.1 and 7.85 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Gross margin
for OES was consistent on a year-to-year comparison. While the Company expects margins to remain similar for 2023, the expected increase
in revenues should create additional gross profit dollars in 2023 compared to 2022.

Insurance
expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was the result of
including in the current period insurance expense of approximately 232,664 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 205,970
for the year ended December 31, 2021, for OES. OED s insurance expense was 44,471 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of 211,300,799 and a working capital deficit of 7,552,616 (including derivative liabilities of 4,314,270). As of December 31, 2022,
the Company was in default of 1,470,000 plus accrued interest on debt instruments due to non-payment upon maturity dates. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the
issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

Currently,
our current capital and our other existing resources will be sufficient to provide the working capital needed for our current business,
however, additional capital will be required to meet our debt obligations, and to further expand our business. We may be unable to obtain
the additional capital required. If we are unable to generate capital or raise additional funds when required, it will have a negative
impact on our business development and financial results. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern as well as our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations.
This going concern could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities. Management s
plans in regard to these factors are discussed below and also in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements filed herein. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we primarily funded our business operations with the existing cash on hand as of January 1, 2022, and
 2,510,000 of proceeds received pursuant to the issuance of a promissory note and 1,141,514 received from sales of common stock. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash of 1,369,210 as compared to 6,632,194 as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had current
liabilities of 15,809,229 (including 4,314,270 of non-cash derivative liabilities), compared to current assets of 8,256,613, which
resulted in a working capital deficit of 7,552,616. The current liabilities are comprised of accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible
debt, derivative liabilities, customer deposits, lease obligations, notes payable and liabilities of discontinued operations. 

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the
United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives
aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s operations is
unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration
of the COVID-19 outbreak , new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional
preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued
business disruption, and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but it may have
a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management expects that its business will be
impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company s business and the duration
for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.

Operating
Activities 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 8,599,296 compared to 6,354,717 for the year ended December
31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net income
of 6,151,885, adjusted by non- cash interest expense of 5,938,622, stock-based compensation of 136,249 and the non-cash expenses of
amortization and depreciation of 191,818. This was offset by the gain on the fair value changes in derivatives related to warrants and
convertible notes of 19,202,431. Net changes of 1,551,000 in operating assets and liabilities increased the cash used in operating
activities. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the net loss of 195,069,214,
adjusted by loss on debt extinguishment of 95,449,996, non- cash interest expense of 51,487,601 (including 38,907,939 for the initial
fair value of the 375,000,000 warrants issued), losses on the fair value changes in derivatives related to warrants and convertible notes
of 17,349,075, debt restructuring costs of 16,450,000, stock-based compensation of 9,322,751 and the non-cash expenses of interest
and amortization and depreciation of 103,000. Net changes of 779,989 in operating assets and liabilities increased the cash used in
operating activities, primarily because of the start-up of the Company s California operations in the support of inventory and
accounts receivable. 

Investing
Activities 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was 65,202, compared to net cash provided by investing activities
of 116,836 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Financing
Activities 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities was 3,401,514, compared to 11,475,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received 2,510,000 of proceeds from the issuance of 3,020,000
promissory note and 1,141,514, net of issuance costs, from the sales of common stock to GHS. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we made payments of 250,000 for notes payable. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, we received 15,000,000 of proceeds from the issuances of 16,610,000 face value of promissory notes
and 13,100,000 (net of costs) from the Series D SPA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired 47,500 shares of
Series C Preferred Stock and 18,667 shares of Series D Preferred Stock from Chis for 11,250,000, redeemed 5,000 shares of the Series
E Preferred Stock for 5,000,000, and repaid 375,000 of notes payable. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
significant accounting policies are described in more details in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgement and estimates used in the preparation
of our financial statements: 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Inventory 

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist of
finished goods. In evaluating the net realizable value of inventory, management also considers,
if applicable, other factors, including known trends, market conditions, currency exchange rates and other such issues. 

18 

Convertible
Instruments 

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and
Hedging Activities. 

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and
risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host
contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at
fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same
terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. 

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value
of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at
the commitment date of this note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in this note. Debt discounts under these arrangements
are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption. 

The
Company accounts for the conversion of convertible debt when a conversion option has been bifurcated using the general extinguishment
standards. The debt and equity linked derivatives are removed at their carrying amounts and the shares issued are measured at their then-current
fair value, with any difference recorded as a gain or loss on extinguishment of the two separate accounting liabilities. 

Revenue
Recognition 

Effective
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue
from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1)
identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price;
(4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation
is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 Revenue Recognition.
Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance
of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable;
and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. There was no impact on the Company s financial statements as a result
of adopting Topic 606 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share 

The
Company computes net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock
method, and convertible notes and stock warrants, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for
the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options, warrants and conversion
of convertible notes. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 

OFF
BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

and credit risk support or other benefits.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

A
review and evaluation was performed by the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO ), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2022, disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported as required in the application of SEC rules and forms. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a set of processes designed by,
or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of our assets; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that
any system of internal control, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the system will be met. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Our
CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as described in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). As a result of this
evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022, as described below. 

We
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the
following material weaknesses: 

Insufficient
Resources: We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. 

20 

Inadequate
Segregation of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. 

Lack
of Audit Committee: We do not have a functioning audit committee, resulting in lack of independent oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 

We
are committed to improving the internal controls and will (1) consider using third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing
and to assist us with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant
accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing additional
outside directors and audit committee members in the future. 

We
have discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of these material
weaknesses, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements
could occur that would not be prevented or detected. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

The
names and ages of our directors and executive officers are set forth below. Also included is their principal occupation(s). Our By-Laws
provide for up to four directors. All directors are elected annually by the stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of the
stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

Brian
P. Conway, the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer brings 20 years of proven success in marketing and business
development for both private and publicly traded companies. Starting off in database management and sales for Venture Direct on Madison
Avenue, he crossed over to Wall Street as a co-founder of Waypoint Capital Partners. During this time, he was responsible for national
sales, marketing, business and product development, national account customers, and new business relations with international and US
companies while creating awareness for public companies with many of the nation s top public relations firms. From October 1, 2014,
through August 31, 2019, Mr. Conway was the CEO, CFO and Director of Ngen Technologies, Inc. (f/k/a/ Liberated Solutions, Inc.). His
relationships and experience with investment bankers, non-dilutive financing, and public relations should be instrumental in moving the
Company forward. 

Family
Relationships 

None 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

No
director, executive officer, significant employee, or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed
in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years. 

Corporate
Governance 

Our
Board has not established any committees, including an audit committee, a compensation committee or a nominating committee, or any committee
performing a similar function. The functions of those committees are being undertaken by our Board. Because we do not have any independent
directors, our Board believes that the establishment of committees of our Board would not provide any benefits to our Company and could
be considered more form than substance. 

Given
our relative size and lack of directors and officers insurance coverage, we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders
will make such a recommendation in the near future. While there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed, in the event
such a proposal is made, all current members of our Board will participate in the consideration of director nominees. 

As
with most small, early-stage companies until such time as our Company further develops our business, achieves a greater revenue base,
and has sufficient working capital to purchase directors and officers insurance, we do not have any immediate prospects
to attract independent directors. When we are able to expand our Board to include one or more independent directors, we intend to establish
an audit committee of our Board of Directors. It is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as
an audit committee financial expert. Our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our Board
members be independent, and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of
our Board of Directors include independent directors, nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or
other committee of our Board. 

22 

Code
of Ethics 

We
adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Management to promote honest and ethical conduct and to deter wrongdoing. This Code applies
to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and other employees performing similar functions. The obligations of the Code
of Ethics supplement, but do not replace, any other code of conduct or ethics policy applicable to our employees generally. 

Under
the Code of Ethics, all members of the senior financial management shall: 

Act
 honestly and ethically in the performance of their duties at our company, 

Avoid
 actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, 

Provide
 full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submits to, the SEC and
 in other public communications by our company, 

Comply
 with rules and regulations of federal, state and local governments and other private and public regulatory agencies that effect the
 conduct of our business and our financial reporting, 

Act
 in good faith, responsibly, with due care, competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or allowing the member s
 independent judgment to be subordinated 

Respect
 the confidentiality of information in the course of work, except when authorized or legally obtained to disclosure such information, 

Share
 knowledge and maintain skills relevant to carrying out the member s duties within our company, 

Proactively
 promote ethical behavior as a responsible partner among peers and colleagues in the work environment and community, 

Achieve
 responsible use of and control over all assets and resources of our company entrusted to the member, and 

Promptly
 bring to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer any information concerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operating
 of internal controls which could adversely affect to record, process, summarize and report financial data or (b) any fraud, whether
 or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in our financial reporting or internal controls. 

Director
Independence 

None
of the members of our Board of Directors qualifies as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of
the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not,
and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged
in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our Board has not made a subjective determination as to each director that
no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out
the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our Board of Directors
made these determinations, our Board would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each
director s business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

In
performing the functions of the audit committee, our board oversees our accounting and financial reporting process. In this function,
our board performs several functions. Our board, among other duties, evaluates and assesses the qualifications of the Company s
independent auditors; determines whether to retain or terminate the existing independent auditors; meets with the independent auditors
and financial management of the Company to review the scope of the proposed audit and audit procedures on an annual basis; reviews and
approves the retention of independent auditors for any non-audit services; reviews the independence of the independent auditors; reviews

Each

will consider nominees recommended by shareholders if submitted in writing to our secretary. Our board believes that any candidate for
director, whether recommended by shareholders or by the board, should be considered on the basis of all factors relevant to our needs
and the credentials of the candidate at the time the candidate is proposed. Such factors include relevant business and industry experience
and demonstrated character and judgment.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had an accumulated deficit of 211,300,799 and a working capital deficit of 7,552,616 (including derivative liabilities of
 4,314,270). As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in default of 1,470,000 plus accrued interest on debt instruments due to non-payment
upon maturity dates. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

(the Merger Agreement with the Merger Sub and filed Articles of Merger (the Articles of Merger with the
Nevada Secretary of State, merging the Merger Sub into the Company, which were stamped effective as of November 3, 2020. As permitted
by the Section 92.A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose and effect of the filing of Articles of Merger was to change
the name of the Company from Ozop Surgical Corp to Ozop Energy Solutions, Inc. 

On
December 11, 2020, the Company formed Ozop Energy Systems, Inc. OES ), a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary

On
August 19, 2021, the Company formed Ozop Capital Partners, Inc. Ozop Capital ), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. Brian Conway was appointed as the sole officer and director of Ozop Capital and has voting control of Ozop
Capital. 

On
October 29, 2021, EV Insurance Company, Inc. EVCO was formed as a captive insurance company in the State of Delaware.
EVCO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ozop Capital. On January 7, 2022, EVCO filed with New Castle County, Delaware DBA OZOP Plus. 

On
February 25, 2022, the Company formed Ozop Engineering and Design, Inc. OED a Nevada corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. OED was formed to become a premier engineering and lighting control design firm. OED offers product and design support
for lighting and solar projects with a focus on fast lead times and technical support. OED and our partners are able to offer the resources
needed for lighting, solar and electrical design projects. OED will provide customers systems to coordinate the understanding of electrical
usage with the relationship between lighting design and lighting controls, by developing more efficient ecofriendly designs. We work
with architects, engineers, facility managers, electrical contractors and engineers. 

and a working capital deficit of (including derivative liabilities of ). As of December 31, 2022,
the Company was in default of plus accrued interest on debt instruments due to non-payment upon maturity dates. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of the
issuance of these financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United
States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed
at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company s operations is unknown and will
depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19
outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective
actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, and reduced
operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but it may have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Management expects that its business will be impacted to some degree, but the
significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company s business and the duration for which it may have an impact
cannot be determined at this time. 

Management s
Plans 

As
a public company, Management believes it will be able to access the public equities market for fund raising for product development,
sales and marketing and inventory requirements as we expand our distribution in the U.S. market. 

On
October 14, 2021, the Company received a Notice of effectiveness related to the Company s Form S-3 Registration Statement (the
 Registration Statement ). Pursuant to the Registration Statement the Company may offer and sell from time to time in one
or more offerings of up to thirty million dollars in aggregate offering price. We may offer these securities in amounts,

OES
is actively engaged in the renewable, electric vehicle EV ), energy storage and energy resiliency sectors. We are engaged
in multiple business lines that include project development as well as equipment distribution. Our solar and energy storage projects
involve large-scale battery and solar photovoltaics (PV) installations. Our utility-scale storage business model is based on an arbitrage
business model in which we install multiple 1+ megawatt batteries, charge them with off-peak grid electricity under contract with the
utility, then sell the power back during peak load hours at a premium, as dictated by prevailing electricity tariffs. 

Equipment
Distributor: OES has entered the component supply/distribution side of the renewable, resiliency and energy storage industries
distributing the core components associated with residential and commercial solar PV systems as well as onsite battery storage and power
generation. In April 2021, the Company signed a five - year lease (beginning June 1, 2021) of approximately 8,100 SF in California, for
office and warehouse space to support the sales and distribution of our west coast operations. The components we are distributing include
PV panels, solar inverters, solar mounting systems, stationary batteries, onsite generators and other associated electrical equipment
and components that are all manufactured by multiple companies, both domestic and international. These core products are sourced from
management-developed relationships and are distributed through our existing network and our in-house sales team. 

Solar
PV: Our PV business model involves the design and construction of electrical generating PV systems that can sell power to the
utilities or be used for off grid use as part of our developing Neo-Grids solution. The Neo-Grids proprietary program, patent pending,
was developed for the off-grid distribution of electricity to remove or reduce the dependency on utilities that currently burdens the
EV Charging sectors. It will also reduce or eliminate the lengthy permitting processes and streamline the installations of those EV chargers. 

Modular
Energy Distribution System: The Neo-Grids, patent pending, is comprised of the design engineering, installation, and operational
methodologies as well as the financial arbitrage of how we produce, capture and distribute electrical energy for the EV markets. :
OES has acquired the license rights to a proprietary system, the Neo-Grids TM System (patent pending), for the capture
and distribution of electrical energy for the EV market. The Neo-Grids TM System will serve both the private
auto and the commercial sectors. The exponential growth of the EV industry has been accelerated by the recent major commitments of most
of the major car manufacturers. Our Neo-Grids TM System leverages this
accelerated growth by offering (1) charging locations that can be installed with reduced delays, restricted areas or load limits and
(2) EV charger electricity that is produced from renewable sources claiming little to no carbon footprint. 

OES
has developed a business plan for the Neo Grids distribution, a solution to the stress forthcoming to the existing grid infrastructure.
The Company has completed its Neo Grid research and development as well as the first set of engineered technical drawings. This
first stage of engineered technical drawings allows us to move forward with stage two, as well as to begin to construct the first prototype
or proof of concept, PoC ). Our PoC design is partially reliant on auto manufacturers establishing standardizations of
the actual charging/discharging protocols of the batteries such as on-board inverters as well as bi-directional capabilities in electric
vehicles, which have only recently been established. As the market growth rate of EV s continues to rise, the stress on the existing
grid-tied infrastructure shows the need for the continued development of our Neo-Grid solution. 

OES
management has decades of experience in the renewable, storage and resilient energy businesses and associated markets, which include
but are not limited to project finance, project development, equipment finance, construction, utility protocol, regulatory policy and
technology assessment. 

Ozop
Plus markets vehicle service contracts VSC s for electric vehicles (EV s) that offer consumers to be able
to purchase additional months and miles above the manufacturer s warranty and to also bring added value to EV owners by utilizing
our partnerships and strengths in the energy market to offer unique and innovative services. Among EV owners concerns are the
EV battery repair and replacement costs, range anxiety, environmental responsibilities, roadside assistance, and the accelerated wear
on additional components that EV vehicles experience. Management believes that the Ozop Plus marketed VSC s will give peace
of mind to the EV buyer. 

In
 May 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with GS Administrators, Inc., a member of Houston-based GSFSGroup. Under the agreement,
 the Company will market GSFSGroup s EV VSC s in all states (except, California, Florida, Massachusetts and Washington)
 to Ozop s network of new and used franchised dealerships and other eligible entities. In addition to acting as an agent for
 the marketing, Ozop also has the right to white label the product under its Ozop Plus brand. Ozop s role won t
 be limited to marketing the product. GSFSGroup plans to tap into Ozop s experience relative to battery collection and disposal
 and has agreed to insurance risk sharing in connection with the insurance policies that back the VSC s. GSFSGroup is working
 on getting the approvals needed for the above four (4) states. 

On
 June 22, 2022, the Company entered into an Agent Agreement with Royal Administration Services, Inc. Royal ). Under
 the agreement, the Company will market Royal s EV VSC s and has the right to white label it under Ozop Plus. Royal has
 agreed to allow Ozop Plus on all VSC s, marketed by Royal and the Company, to assume all the risk related to the electric battery
 at an agreed upon premium. The battery premium is dependent on the consumer s selection of the duration of the VSC, the miles
 selected for coverage and the type of vehicle that the consumer has purchased, with a key component being the kWh size of the battery.
 These VSC s have a maximum of 10 years and 150,000 miles and cover new and used cars from model year 2017 and newer. Royal s
 VSCs are now effective in 46 states and the others have various waiting times or approvals needed. 

On
 October 13, 2022, EVCO entered into a Reinsurance Contract (the Contract with American Bankers Insurance Company of
 Florida ABIC or the Ceding Company ). Royal is the Administrator of the Contract. Pursuant to the terms
 of the Contract, ABIC will cede 100 of the battery coverage portion of all electric vehicle service contracts to EVCO. On the same
 date ABIC and EVCO also entered into a Trust Agreement, whereas EVCO as the reinsurer agrees to deposit an amount equal to unearned
 premium reserves, plus losses reported but unpaid, plus the estimated amount of losses incurred but not reported to the trust account.

prior to delivery. We also buy product from other distributors if we are not able to purchase direct from the manufacturer. While management
believes all of its relationships with its vendors are good, if we are unable to continue to use and/or find alternative suppliers, when
we cannot buy direct, it may have a material negative effect on our business.
