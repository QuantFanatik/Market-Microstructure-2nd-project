Description
of Business 

Lvpai
Group Limited Lvpai , the Company , we , us has been dormant since November 2011.
On March 16, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Case Number: A-20-809716-B, Custodian Ventures LLC Custodian was appointed custodian of the Company. 

On
March 17, 2020, Custodian appointed David Lazar as the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial
Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

David

at Zenith Partners International since 2013, where he specializes in research and development, sales, and marketing. From 2014 through
2015, David was the Chief Executive Officer of Dico, Inc., which was then sold to Peekay Boutiques. Since February of 2018, Mr. Lazar
has been the managing member of Custodian Ventures LLC, where he specializes in assisting distressed public companies. Since March 2018,
David has acted as the managing member of Activist Investing LLC, which specializes in active investing in distressed public companies.
David has a diverse knowledge of financial, legal, and operations management; public company management, accounting, audit preparation,
due diligence reviews, and SEC regulations. 

On
January 25, 2021, as a result of a private transaction, 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share (the
 Shares of the Company were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Yang Fuzhu (the Purchaser ). Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible to 200 shares of common stock As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately 86.95 
holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis of the Company, and became
the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was 250,000. The source of the cash consideration for the Shares
was personal funds of the Purchaser. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar released the Company from 65,503 in debt owed to
him. 

1 

On
January 25, 2021, David Lazar, serving as a director and an officer, ceased to be the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director. At the effective date of the transfer, Yang Fuzhu consented to act
as the new President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

On
August 12, 2022, as a result of two private transactions, (i) 4,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share
(the Shares of the Company, were transferred from Yang Fuzhu to Chen Yuanhang and (ii) 1,000,000 Shares were transferred
to Frank Chen (together, the Purchasers ). As a result, the Purchasers became holders of an aggregate of approximately 43.48 
of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company and Yang Fuzhu retained 43.48 of the voting rights of
the Company and is no longer the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was 172,500. The source of the cash
consideration for the Shares was personal funds of the Purchasers. 

On
August 12, 2022, the existing director and officer resigned immediately. Accordingly, Yang Fuzhu, serving as a director and an officer,
ceased to be the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer and Secretary. At the effective
date of the transfer, Chen Yuanhang consented to act as the new Chief Executive Officer, President, and a Director of the Company, and
Zhang Wenmin consented to act as the new Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 

Conversion 

Effective
on December 15, 2022, the Company has approved a 1 for 50 conversion to convert 2,000,000 preferred stock to 100,000,000 common
shares, there was 8,000,000 preferred stock outstanding as of December 15, 2022. As a result of the conversion, the Company has
100,103,103 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The par value remains unchanged at 0.001 per share, which resulted in a
reclassification of capital from par value to additional paid-in capital in excess of par value. All share and per share amount in
the accompanying financial statement for the prior period have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the conversion. 

Competition
and Market Conditions 

We
will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected
to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and
wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial
and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business
or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic,
many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore
currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until
such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect
there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased
raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control. 

Regulation 

As
of the date of this Report, we are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC by Section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). 

Depending
on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other
laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state level regulation of privacy.
Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect
on our future operating results. 

2 

Employees 

As
of the date of this Report, we do not have employees. However, an entity controlled by our Chief Executive Officer provides part-time
consulting services to us without compensation. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition 

Risks
associated with doing business in China 

Certain judgments obtained against us by our
officers and directors may not be enforceable 

We are a Nevada corporation
but most of our assets are and will be located outside of the United States. Almost all our operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition,
all our officers and directors are the nationals and residents of a country other than the United States. Almost all of their assets are
located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon
them. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities
laws against us and our officers and directors, since he or she is not a resident in the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty
as to whether the courts of the PRC or other jurisdictions would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. 

Regulations Relating to M A
Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors,
which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

On August 8,
2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, adopted the Regulations on Mergers
of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June
22, 2009. Foreign investors shall comply with the M A Rules when they purchase equity interests of a domestic company or subscribe
the increased capital of a domestic company, thus changing the nature of the domestic company into a foreign-invested enterprise; or when
the foreign investors establish a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC, purchase the assets of a domestic company and operate the assets;
or when the foreign investors purchase the asset of a domestic company, establish a foreign-invested enterprise by injecting such assets
and operate the assets. The M A Rules purport, among other things, to require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for overseas
listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval
of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. 

The M A
Rules discussed in the risk factor and related regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures
and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. For example,
the M A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control
of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have
impact on the national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds
a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand, (iv) or in circumstances where overseas companies established or controlled by PRC enterprises
or residents acquire affiliated domestic companies. Mergers, acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to
take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must also be notified in advance to the MOFCOM when the threshold
under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings issued by the State Council in August 2008
is triggered. 

In addition,
the security review rules issued by the MOFCOM that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign
investors that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors
may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns are subject to strict review
by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction
through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. Furthermore, according to the security review, foreign investments that would result
in acquiring the actual control of assets in certain key sectors, such as critical agricultural products, energy and resources, equipment
manufacturing, infrastructure, transport, cultural products and services, information technology, Internet products and services, financial
services and technology sectors, are required to obtain approval from designated governmental authorities in advance. 

3 

In the future,
we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and
other relevant rules to complete such transactions, if required, could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including
obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear
whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry that raises national defense and security or national security 
concerns. However, the MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in
an industry subject to the security review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, including those by way of entering into
contractual control arrangements with target entities, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Our ability to expand our business or
maintain or expand our market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, according
to the M A Rules, if a PRC entity or individual plans to merge or acquire its related PRC entity through an overseas company legitimately
incorporated or controlled by such entity or individual, such a merger and acquisition will be subject to examination and approval by
the MOFCOM. There is a possibility that the PRC regulators may promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain the approval
of the MOFCOM or other PRC governmental authorities for our completed or ongoing mergers and acquisitions. There is no assurance that,
if we plan to make an acquisition, we can obtain such approval from the MOFCOM or any other relevant PRC governmental authorities for
our mergers and acquisitions, and if we fail to obtain those approvals, we may be required to suspend our acquisition and be subject to
penalties. Any uncertainties regarding such approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and corporate structure. 

We may not be able to complete an initial business
combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and
review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS ), or ultimately
prohibited. 

Certain federally
licensed businesses in the United States, such as broadcasters and airlines, may be subject to rules or regulations that limit foreign
ownership. In addition, CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the
United States by foreign persons in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States.
Our sponsors, Mr. Chen Yuanhang and Mr. Yang Fuzhu, PRC residents, and will own approximately 99.90 of our outstanding shares. Because
we may be considered a foreign person under such rules and regulations, any proposed business combination between us and
a U.S. business engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security could be subject to such foreign ownership restrictions
and/or CFIUS review. 

The scope of
CFIUS was expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 FIRRMA to include certain non-passive,
non-controlling investments in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business.
FIRRMA and subsequent implementing regulations that are now in force also subject certain categories of investments to mandatory filings.
If our potential initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may be
unable to consummate a business combination with such business. 

In addition,
if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS s jurisdiction, we may be required to make a mandatory filing, decide to
submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or proceed with the initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and then bear the risk of
CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business
combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business combination or order us to
divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded without first obtaining CFIUS clearance. The foreign
ownership limitations, and the potential impact of CFIUS, may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with us or prevent us from pursuing
certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders. As a result,
the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected
in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues.

Trading
in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect
or investigate completely our auditors for two consecutive years. 

In
recent years, U.S. regulatory authorities have continued to express their concerns about challenges in their oversight of financial statement
audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. As part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on
access to audit and other information, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020.
The HFCAA includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to
inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor s local jurisdiction.
The HFCAA also requires that, to the extent that the PCAOB has been unable to inspect an issuer s auditor for three consecutive
years since 2021, the SEC shall prohibit its securities registered in the United States from being traded on any national securities
exchange or over-the-counter markets in the United States. 

On
March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements
of the HFCAA. The interim final rule applies to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report
issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. Consistent with the HFCAA, the interim final rule requires
the submission of documentation to the SEC establishing that such a registrant is not owned or controlled by a government entity in that
foreign jurisdiction and also requires disclosure in a foreign issuer s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and
government influence on, such registrants. On May 13, 2021, the PCAOB issued proposed PCAOB Rule 6100, Board Determinations Under the
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act for public comment. The proposed rule provides a framework for making determinations as to
whether PCAOB is unable to inspect an audit firm in a foreign jurisdiction, including the timing, factors, bases, publication and revocation
or modification of such determinations, and such determinations will be made on a jurisdiction-wide basis in a consistent manner applicable
to all firms headquartered in the jurisdiction. In November 2021, the SEC approved PCAOB Rule 6100. On December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted
amendments to final rules implementing the disclosure and submission requirements of the HFCAA. 

On
June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act or AHFCAA, and on February 4, 2022,
the U.S. House of Representatives passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic
Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022, or the COMPETES Act. If either bill is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC
to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections
or complete investigations for two consecutive years instead of three. As a result, our securities may be prohibited from trading on
Nasdaq or over-the-counter markets if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for three consecutive years as specified in the HFCAA
or two years if the AHFCAA or the COMPETES Act becomes law, and would reduce the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading
or delisted. 

On
December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The
rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public
accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a
position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. 

On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB announced the PCAOB Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act determinations (the PCAOB determinations relating to the PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland
China of the PRC or Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more
authorities in the PRC or Hong Kong. 

5 

On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a SOP with the CSRC and the MOF of the PRC regarding cooperation in the oversight of PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong which establishes a method for the PCAOB to conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong, as contemplated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the agreement, (a) the PCAOB has sole
discretion to select the firms, audit engagements and potential violations it inspects and investigates without consultation with, or
input from, PRC authorities; (b) procedures are in place for PCAOB inspectors and investigators to view complete audit work papers with
all information included and for the PCAOB to retain information as needed; (c) the PCAOB has direct access to interview and take testimony
from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB inspects or investigates; and (d) the PCAOB shall have the unfettered ability
to transfer information to the SEC in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the SEC can use the information for all regulatory
purposes, including administrative or civil enforcement actions. The PCAOB was required to reassess its determinations as to whether
it is able to carry out inspections and investigations completely and without obstruction by the end of 2022. On December 15, 2022, the
PCAOB determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong Kong and vacated its previous determinations. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to
facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination. 

Congress
passed fiscal year 2023 Omnibus spending legislation in December 2022, which contained provisions to accelerate the HFCAA timeline for
implementation of trading prohibitions from three years to two years. As a result, the SEC is required to prohibit an issuer s
securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections or complete investigations for
two consecutive years. 

Our
current auditor, MICHAEL GILLESPIE ASSOCIATES, PLLC, an independent registered public accounting firm that is headquartered in
the Vancouver, is a firm registered with the PCAOB and is required by the laws of the U.S. to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB
to assess its compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. MICHAEL GILLESPIE ASSOCIATES, PLLC has been subject
to PCAOB inspections, and is not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong that are subject
to PCAOB s determination on December 16, 2021 of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, or if there is any
regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit MICHAEL GILLESPIE ASSOCIATES, PLLC to provide audit documentations
located in China or Hong Kong to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, or the PCAOB expands the scope of the Determination so that
we are subject to the HFCAA, as the same may be amended, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not
issued by auditors that are completely inspected or investigated by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections or investigations of audit
work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors audits and their quality control procedures,
could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate. 

China s
political climate and economic conditions, as well as changes in government policies, laws and regulations which may be quick with little
advance notice, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
principal executive offices are located in China and our sole executive officer and director is a resident of and is physically located
in and has significant ties to China. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject, to a significant
extent, to economic, political and legal developments in China. For example, as a result of recent proposed changes in the cybersecurity
regulations in China that would require certain Chinese technology firms to undergo a cybersecurity review before being allowed to list
on foreign exchanges, this may have the effect of further narrowing the list of potential businesses in China s consumer, technology
and mobility sectors that we intend to focus on for our business combination or the ability of the combined entity to list in the United
States. 

China s
economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level
of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant
growth in the past two to three decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Demand
for target services and products depends, in large part, on economic conditions in China. Any slowdown in China s economic growth
may cause our potential customers to delay or cancel their plans to purchase our services and products, which in turn could reduce our
net revenues. 

Although
China s economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy since the late 1970s, the PRC government
continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises
significant control over China s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling the incurrence and payment of foreign
currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
Changes in any of these policies, laws and regulations may be quick with little advance notice and could adversely affect the economy
in China and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock. 

6 

The
PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage foreign investment and sustainable economic growth and to guide the allocation
of financial and other resources. However, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not repeal or alter these measures or introduce
new measures that will have a negative effect on us, or more specifically, we cannot assure you that the PRC government will not initiate
possible governmental actions or scrutiny to us, which could substantially affect our operation and the value of our common stock may
depreciate quickly. China s social and political conditions may change and become unstable. Any sudden changes to China s
political system or the occurrence of widespread social unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Any
failure or perceived failure by our PRC subsidiaries to comply with the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms Economy Sector
and other PRC anti-monopoly laws and regulations may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation or claims
against us and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The
PRC anti-monopoly enforcement agencies have strengthened enforcement under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law in the recent years. On December
28, 2018, the SAMR issued the Notice on Anti-monopoly Enforcement Authorization, pursuant to which its province-level branches are authorized
to conduct anti-monopoly enforcement within their respective jurisdictions. On September 11, 2020, the Anti-Monopoly Commission of the
State Council issued Anti-monopoly Compliance Guideline for Operators, which requires operators to establish anti-monopoly compliance
management systems under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law to manage anti-monopoly compliance risks. On February 7, 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Commission
of the State Council published Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector that specified circumstances under which
an activity of an internet platform will be identified as monopolistic act as well as concentration filing procedures for business operators.
According to the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law, if a business operator carries out a concentration in violation of the law, the relevant authority
shall order the business operator to terminate the concentration, dispose of the shares or assets or transfer the business within a specified
time limit, or take other measures to restore the pre-concentration status, and impose a fine of up to RMB500,000. On March 12, 2021,
the SAMR published several administrative penalty cases in connection with concentration of business operators that violated PRC Anti-Monopoly
Law in the internet sector. 

On
October 23, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress issued a discussion draft of the amended Anti-Monopoly
Law, which proposes to increase the fines for illegal concentration of business operators to no more than ten percent of its last
year s sales revenue if the concentration of business operator has or may have an effect of excluding or limiting competition;
or a fine of up to RMB5 million if the concentration of business operator does not have an effect of excluding or limiting competition. 
The draft also proposes for the relevant authority to investigate transaction where there is evidence that the concentration has or may
have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition, even if such concentration does not reach the filing threshold. On December
24, 2021, nine government agencies, including the NDRC, jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Healthy and Sustainable Development
of Platform Economy, which provides that, among others, monopolistic agreements, abuse of dominant market position and illegal concentration
of business operators in the field of platform economy will be strictly investigated and punished in accordance with the relevant laws. 

At
the present time, we have a relatively small scale supply chain platform operations based on our market share in our product markets
and other factors. We are not an operator with a dominant market position, and our operating activity cannot constitute an anti-monopoly
behavior that abuses our dominant market position. We have not entered into monopoly agreements prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law with
competing business operators. As of the date of the prospectus, we have not received a notification from the anti-monopoly regulatory
authority requiring us to file the concentration of undertakings or received any related administrative penalties. We believe that we
are in compliance with the currently effective PRC anti-monopoly laws in all material aspects. Nevertheless, if the PRC regulatory authorities
identify any of our activities as monopolistic under the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law or the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform
Economy Sector, we may be subject to investigations and administrative penalties, and therefore materially and adversely affect our financial
conditions, operations and business prospects. If we are required to take any rectifying or remedial measures or are subject to any penalties,
our reputation and business operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

7 

Recent
regulatory developments in China, including greater oversight and control by the CAC over data security, may subject us to additional
regulatory review, and any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over foreign investment in China-based
issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the
value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

On
December 28, 2021, the CAC, NDRC, and several other agencies jointly issued the final version of the Revised Measures for Cybersecurity
Review, or the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022 and replaced the previously issued Revised Measures
for Cybersecurity Review. Under the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, an online platform operator in possession of personal
data of more than one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review if it intends to list its securities on a foreign stock exchange.
The operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services, and the online platform operators (together
with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the Operators carrying out data processing activities that
affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, and any online platform operator who controls more than
one million users personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to
be listed in a foreign country. Pursuant to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, we don t believe we will be subject to the cybersecurity
review by the CAC, given that (i) our online platform business just start up, we possess personal information of a very small number
of users (less than 100 users) in our business operations as of the date of this report, significantly less than the one million user
threshold set for a data processing operator applying for listing on a foreign exchange that is required to pass such cybersecurity review;
and (ii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus shall not be classified as core or important
data by the authorities. We don t believe that we are an Operator within the meaning of the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, nor
do we control more than one million users personal information, and as such, we should not be required to apply for a cybersecurity
review under the Revised Cybersecurity Measures. 

However,
there remains uncertainty as to how the Revised Cybersecurity Measures may be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory
agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new rules and regulations related to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures. For example, there is
still no clear definition of online platform operator . Whether the data processing activities carried out by traditional
enterprises (such as food, medicine, automobile and other production enterprises) are subject to such review and the scope of the review
remain to be further clarified by the regulatory authorities in the subsequent implementation process. If any new laws, regulations,
implementation measures or interpretation are adopted, we may need to take further actions and invest resources to comply with such new
rules and to minimize any potential negative effects on us. In addition, if the number of our online platform users increases to a level
close to one million, we would expect to prepare for the required cybersecurity review procedure and approval from the PRC government. 

Governmental
control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. 

The
PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency
out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our income will currently only
be derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability
of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign
currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit
distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval
from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where
RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated
in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current
account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency
demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our security-holders. 

8 

Failure
to comply with the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules relating to the overseas direct investment or the engagement in the issuance or
trading of securities overseas by our PRC resident stockholders may subject such stockholders to fines or other liabilities. 

Our
ability to conduct foreign exchange activities in the PRC may be subject to the interpretation and enforcement of the Implementation
Rules of the Administrative Measures for Individual Foreign Exchange promulgated by SAFE in January 2007 (as amended and supplemented,
the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules ). Under the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules, any PRC individual seeking to make
a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate
registrations in accordance with SAFE provisions. PRC individuals who fail to make such registrations may be subject to warnings, fines
or other liabilities. 

SAFE
promulgated the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through
Special Purpose Vehicles, or Notice 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch
in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.
In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes
material events relating to material change of capitalization or structure of the PRC resident itself (such as capital increase, capital
reduction, share transfer or exchange, merger or spin off). 

We
may not be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. For example, because the investment in
or trading of our shares will happen in an overseas public or secondary market where shares are often held with brokers in brokerage
accounts, it is unlikely that we will know the identity of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Furthermore, we have no
control over any of our future beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary
approval and registration procedures required by the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules. 

To
our knowledge, our beneficial owners, who are PRC residents, have not completed the Notice 37 registration. And we cannot guarantee that
all or any of the shareholders will complete the Notice 37 registration prior to the closing of this Offering. Failure by any such shareholders
or beneficial owners to comply with Notice 37 could restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries 
ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.
In addition, the PRC resident shareholders who fail to complete Notice 37 registration may subject to fines less than RMB50,000. 

As
these foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and implementation has
been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments
and transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. 

It
is uncertain how the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules will be interpreted or enforced and whether such interpretation or enforcement
will affect our ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether the failure
by any of our PRC resident stockholders to make the required registration will subject our PRC subsidiaries to fines or legal sanctions
on their operations, delay or restriction on repatriation of proceeds of our securities offerings into the PRC, restriction on remittance
of dividends or other punitive actions that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 

Under
the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a Resident Enterprise of China. Such classification will likely
result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders. 

China
passed an Enterprise Income Tax Law (the EIT Law ), as most recently amended and effective on December 29, 2018, and the
related Implementation Regulations, as amended and effective on April 23 2019. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of
China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can
be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define
de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting,
and properties of the enterprise. 

9 

On
April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation of China issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese
Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or
the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation to offshore entities controlled by a Chinese enterprise
or group. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group
will be classified as a non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise if (i) its senior management in charge of daily
operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or
persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate stamps, board and stockholder minutes are
kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management are often resident in China. A resident
enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25 on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate
of 10 when paying dividends to its non-PRC stockholders. 

We
currently have no operations, and investors therefore have no basis on which to evaluate the Company s future prospects. 

We
currently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business to commence operations and
generate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability
to achieve our business objective of locating and completing a business combination with a target business. We have no current arrangements
or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete a business combination
in a reasonable timeframe, on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to complete a business combination as planned, we will never generate
any operating revenues. 

We
may face difficulties or delays in our search for a business combination, and we may not have access to sufficient capital to consummate
a business combination. 

We
may face difficulty identifying a viable business opportunity or negotiating or paying for any resulting business combination. Economic
factors that are beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic downturn, as well as increased competition
for acquisitions of operating entities that we expect to encounter as a result thereof, may hinder our efforts to locate and/or obtain
a business that is suitable for our business goals at a price we can afford and on terms that will enable us to sufficiently grow our
business to generate value to our shareholders. We have limited capital, and we may not be able to take advantage of any available business
opportunities on favorable terms or at all due to the limited availability of capital. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient
capital to provide us with the necessary funds to successfully develop and implement our plan of operation or acquire a business we deem
to be appropriate or necessary to accomplish our objectives, in which case we may be forced to terminate our business plan and your investment
in the Company could become worthless. 

If
we are not successful in acquiring a new business and generating material revenues, investors will likely lose their investment. 

If
we are not successful in developing a viable business plan and acquiring a new business through which to implement it, our investors 
entire investment in the Company could become worthless. Even if we are successful in combining with or acquiring the assets of an operating
entity, we can provide no assurances that the Company will be able to generate significant revenue therefrom in the short-term or at
all or that investors will derive a profit from their investment. If we are not successful, our investors will likely lose their entire
investment. 

If
we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable. 

Businesses,
including development stage companies such as ours and/or any operating business or businesses we may acquire, often grow rapidly, and
tend to have difficulty managing their growth. If we are able to acquire an operating business, we will likely need to expand our management
team and other key personnel by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees and/or consultants capable of providing
the necessary support. 

We
cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges
could cause us to lose money, and your investment could be lost. 

10 

Because
we have limited capital, we may need to raise additional capital in the future by issuing debt or equity securities, the terms of which
may dilute our current investors and/or reduce or limit their liquidation or other rights. 

We
may require additional capital to acquire a business. We may not be able to obtain additional capital when required. Future business
development activities, as well as administrative expenses such as salaries, insurance, general overhead, legal and compliance expenses,
and accounting expenses will require a substantial amount of additional capital. 

The
terms of securities we issue in future capital raising transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include liquidation
preferences, superior voting rights or the issuance of other derivative securities, which could have a further dilutive effect on or
subordinate the rights of our current investors. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity securities will likely dilute
the ownership percentage of our shareholders. Additionally, any debt securities we issue would likely create a liquidation preference
superior that of our current investors and, if convertible into shares of Common Stock, would also pose the risk of dilution. 

We
may be unable to obtain necessary financing if and when required. 

Our
ability to obtain financing, if and when necessary, may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets (both in general and in the
particular industry or industries in which we may choose to operate), our limited operating history and current lack of operations, the
national and global economies, and the condition of the market for microcap securities. Further, economic downturns such as the current
global depression caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase our requirements for capital, particularly if such economic downturn persists
for an extended period of time or after we have acquired an operating entity, and may limit or hinder our ability to obtain the funding
we require. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with any revenues we may generate from
future operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to discontinue our development or implementation
of a business plan, cancel our search for business opportunities, cease our operations, divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain
financing on unattractive terms. If any of the foregoing should happen, our shareholders could lose some or all of their investment. 

Because
we are still developing our business plan, we do not have any agreement for a business combination. 

We
have no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a business combination with any specific entity.
We may not be successful in identifying and evaluating a suitable acquisition candidate or in consummating a business combination. We
are neutral as to what industry or segment for any target company. We have not established specific metrics and criteria we will look
for in a target company, and if and when we do we may face difficulty reaching a mutual agreement with any such entity, including in
light of market trends and forces beyond our control. Given our early-stage status, there is considerable uncertainty and therefore inherent
risk to investors that we will not succeed in developing and implementing a viable business plan. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition, future plans and results of operations. 

The
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected, and other events (such as a significant outbreak of variations thereof
or other infectious diseases could adversely affect), the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential
target business with which we consummate an initial business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we
may be unable to complete an initial business combination if concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability
to have meetings with potential investors or the target company s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to
negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for an initial business combination
will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning
the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. 

If
the disruptions posed by COVID-19 continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate an initial business combination,
or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely
affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing
which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity
in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. 

11 

Because
we are dependent upon Chen Yuanhang, our Chief Executive Officer and director to manage and oversee our Company, the loss of him could
adversely affect our plan and results of operations. 

We
currently have director and officer, Chen Yuanhang, who manages the Company and is presently evaluating a viable plan for our future
operations. We will rely solely on his judgment in connection with selecting a target company and the terms and structure of any resulting
business combination. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, which
could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position. 

Further,
because Mr. Yuanhang serves as Chief Executive Officer and sole director and also holds a controlling interest in the Company s
Common Stock, our other shareholders will have limited ability to influence the Company s direction or management. 

In
addition, although not likely, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of a combination with
their business. The departure of a target s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and prospects of our post-combination
business. The role of a target s key personnel upon the completion of the transaction cannot be ascertained at this time. Although
we contemplate that certain or all members of a target s management team may remain associated with the target following a change
of control thereof, there can be no assurance that all of such target s management team will decide to remain in place. The loss
of key personnel, either before or after a business combination and including management of either us or a combined entity could negatively
impact the operations and profitability of our business. 

Risks
Related to a Potential Business Acquisition 

We
may encounter difficulty locating and consummating a business combination, including as a result of the competitive disadvantages we
have. 

We
expect to face intense competition in our search for a revenue-producing business to combine with or acquire. Given the current economic
climate, venture capital firms, larger companies, blank check companies such as special purpose acquisition companies and other investors
are purchasing operating entities or the assets thereof in high volumes and at relatively discounted prices. These parties may have greater
capital or human resources than we do and/or more experience in a particular industry within which we choose to search. Most of these
competitors have a certain amount of liquid cash available to take advantage of favorable market conditions for prospective business
purchaser such as those caused by the recent pandemic. Any delay or inability to locate, negotiate and enter into a business combination
as a result of the relative illiquidity of our current asset or other disadvantages we have relative to our competitors could cause us
to lose valuable business opportunities to our competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
may expend significant time and capital on a prospective business combination that is not ultimately consummated. 

The
investigation of each specific target business and any subsequent negotiation and drafting of related agreements, SEC disclosure and
other documents will require substantial amounts of management s time and attention and material additional costs in connection
with outsourced services from accountants, attorneys, and other professionals. We will likely expend significant time and resources searching
for, conducting due diligence on, and negotiating transaction terms in connection with a proposed business combination that may not ultimately
come to fruition. In such event, all of the time and capital resources expended by the Company in such a pursuit may be lost and unrecoverable
by the Company or its shareholders. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable business
may arise that force us to terminate discussions with a target company, such as the target s failure or inability to provide adequate
documentation to assist in our investigation, a party s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction
as required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive
bid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the
transaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for a new business and investors should be aware of them before investing
in an enterprise such as ours. 

12 

Conflicts
of interest may arise between us and our shareholders, directors, or management, which may have a negative impact on our ability to consummate
a business combination or favorable terms or generate revenue. 

Our
Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Yuanhang, is not required to commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest
in allocating his time between managing the Company and other businesses in which he is or may be involved. We do not intend to have
any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. Mr. Yuanhang is not obligated to contribute any specific number of
hours to our affairs, and he may engage in other business endeavors while he provides consulting services to the Company. If any of his
other business affairs require him to devote substantial amounts of time to such matters, it could materially limit his ability to devote
his time and attention to our business which could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination or generate
revenue. 

It
is possible that we obtain an operating company in which a director or officer of the Company has an ownership interest in or that he
or she is an officer, director, or employee of. If we do obtain any business affiliated with an officer or director, such business combination
may be on terms other than what would be arrived at in an arms-length transaction. If any conflict of interest arises, it could adversely
affect a business combination or subsequent operations of the Company, in which case our shareholders may see diminished value relative
to what would have been available through a transaction with an independent third party. 

We
may engage in a business combination that causes tax consequences to us and our shareholders. 

Federal
and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be a significant factor in considering any business combination that we may undertake.
Under current federal law, such transactions may be subject to significant taxation to the buyer and its shareholders under applicable
federal and state tax laws. While we intend to structure any business combination so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences
to the extent practicable in accordance with our business objectives, there can be no assurance that any business combination we undertake
will meet the statutory or regulatory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or similar favorable treatment or that the parties to
such a transaction will obtain the tax treatment intended or expected upon a transfer of equity interests or assets. A non-qualifying
reorganization, combination or similar transaction could result in the imposition of significant taxation, both at the federal and state
levels, which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the transaction, including our shareholders. 

It
is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded any opportunity to evaluate or approve a business combination. 

It
is unlikely that our shareholders will be afforded the opportunity to evaluate and approve a proposed business combination. In most cases,
business combinations do not require shareholder approval under applicable law, and our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not afford
our shareholders with the right to approve such a transaction. Further, Mr. Yuanhang, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director,
owns the vast majority of our outstanding Common Stock. Accordingly, our shareholders will be relying almost exclusively on the judgement
of our board of directors Board and Chief Executive Officer and any persons on whom they may rely with respect to a potential
business combination. In order to develop and implement our business plan, may in the future hire lawyers, accountants, technical experts,
appraisers, or other consultants to assist with determining the Company s direction and consummating any transactions contemplated
thereby. We may rely on such persons in making difficult decisions in connection with the Company s future business and prospects.
The selection of any such persons will be made by our Board, and any expenses incurred or decisions made based on any of the foregoing
could prove to be adverse to the Company in hindsight, the result of which could be diminished value to our shareholders. 

13 

Because
our search for a business combination is not presently limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific target businesses, prospective
investors will be unable to evaluate the merits or risks of any particular target business operations until such time as they
are identified and disclosed. 

We
are still determining the Company s business plan, and we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating entity
in any number of industries or sectors. Because we have not yet entered into any letter of intent or agreement to acquire a particular
business, prospective investors currently have no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business s
operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, prospects or other metrics or qualities they deem appropriate
in considering to invest in the Company. Further, if we complete a business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent
in the operations of the business we acquire. For example, if we acquire a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established
operating history, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a new business or a development stage entity.
Although our management intends to evaluate and weigh the merits and risks inherent in a particular target business and make a decision
based on the Company and its shareholders interests, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all the
significant risks inherent in a target business, that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence or that we will ultimately
acquire a viable business and generate material revenue therefrom. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and
leave us with no ability to reduce the likelihood that those risks will adversely impact a target business or mitigate any harm to the
Company caused thereby. Should we select a course of action, or fail to select a course of action, that ultimately exposes us to unknown
or unidentified risks, our business will be harmed and you could lose some or all of your investment. 

Past
performance by our management and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us. 

While
our Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in advising businesses, his past performance, the performance of other entities or persons
with which he is involved, or the performance of any other personnel we may retain in the future will not necessarily be an indication
of either (i) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) the future operating results
of the Company including with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of
him or any other of our personnel or their affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance or that an investment
in us will be profitable. In addition, an investment in the Company is not an investment in any entities affiliated with our management
or other personnel. While management intends to endeavor to locate a viable business opportunity and generate shareholder value, there
can be no assurance that we will succeed in this endeavor. 

We
may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors that are outside of our management s area of expertise. 

We
will consider a business combination outside of our management s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented
to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for the Company. Although management intends to endeavor
to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain
or assess all the significant risks, or that we will accurately determine the actual value of a prospective operating entity to acquire.
In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management s expertise, our management s ability
to evaluate and make decisions on behalf of the Company may be limited, or we may make material expenditures on additional personnel
or consultants to assist management in the Company s operations. Investors should be aware that the information contained herein
regarding the areas of our management s expertise will not necessarily be relevant to an understanding of the business that we
ultimately elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risks
or strategic opportunities that may arise. Accordingly, any shareholders in the Company following a business combination could suffer
a reduction in the value of their shares, and any resulting loss will likely not be recoverable. 

14 

We
may attempt to complete a business combination with a private target company about which little information is available, and such target
entity may not generate revenue as expected or otherwise by compatible with us as expected. 

In
pursuing our search for a business to acquire, we will likely seek to complete a business combination with a privately held company.
Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and the only information available to us prior to making a decision
may be from documents and information provided directly to us by the target company in connection with the transaction. Such documents
or information or the conclusions we draw therefrom could prove to be inaccurate or misleading. As such, we may be required to make our
decision on whether to pursue a potential business combination based on limited, incomplete, or faulty information, which may result
in our subsequent operations generating less revenue than expected, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of
operations. 

Our
ability to assess the management of a prospective target business may be limited and, as a result, we may acquire a target business whose
management does not have the skills, qualifications, or abilities to enable a seamless transition, which could, in turn, negatively impact
our results of operations. 

When
evaluating the desirability of a potential business combination, our ability to assess the target business s management may be
limited due to a lack of time, resources, or information. Our management s assessment of the capabilities of the target s
management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities expected. Further,
in most cases the target s management may be expected to want to manage us and replace our Chief Executive Officer. Should the
target s management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage a public company or assist with their
former entity s merger or combination into ours, the operations and profitability of the post-acquisition business may be negatively
impacted and our shareholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. 

Any
business we acquire will likely lack diversity of operations or geographical reach, and in such case we will be subject to risks associated
with dependence on a single industry or region. 

Our
search for a business will likely be focused on entities with a single or limited business activity and/or that operate in a limited
geographic area. While larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversifying their operations among different industries
and regions, smaller companies such as ours and the entities we anticipate reviewing for a potential business combination generally lack
diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of their business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely
by risks affecting the industry or the region in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified. In addition to
general economic risks, we could be exposed to natural disasters, civil unrest, technological advances, and other uncontrollable developments
that will threaten our viability if and to the extent our future operations are limited to a single industry or region. If we do not
diversify our operations, our financial condition and results of operations will be at risk. 

15 

Changes
in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability
to negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations. 

We
are subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state, and local governments. In addition to SEC regulations, any business we
acquire in the future may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and
expend material amounts on compliance. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming
and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from
time to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments,
and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result
in material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Due
to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile. 

There
is currently a limited market for our Common Stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our Common Stock will develop,
even if we are successful in consummating a business combination. Recently, the price of our Common Stock has been volatile for no reason.
Further, even if an active market for our Common Stock develops, it will likely be subject to by significant price volatility when compared
to more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our Common Stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for
the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our Common Stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise
described in this Report, including: 

General
 speculative fever; 

A
 prospective business combination and the terms and conditions thereof; 

The
 operating performance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom; 

The
 performance of our competitors in the marketplace, both pre- and post-combination; 

The
 public s reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information; 

Changes
 in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies
 in the industry of a business that we acquire; 

Variations
 in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting
 decline in the economy; 

The
 public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future; 

The
 number of shares of our Common Stock that are publicly traded in the future; 

Actions
 of our existing shareholders, including sales of Common Stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant
 investors; and 

The
 employment or termination of key personnel. 

16 

Many
of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of whether we can consummate
a business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods
of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities
class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s time and attention, which would otherwise
be used to benefit our business. 

Because
trading in our Common Stock is so limited, investors who purchase our Common Stock may depress the market if they sell Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks
traded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. Our Common Stock itself infrequently
trades. 

The
market price of our Common Stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are sold at once or in large blocks. 

Presently
the market for our Common Stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders
may sell their shares of our Common Stock which may depress the market price. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the
public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, which could
reduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders. 

Future
issuance of our Common Stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition
and any resulting financing. 

We
may issue additional shares of our Common Stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our Common Stock could substantially
dilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of Common Stock in the public market, either
in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in a business combination which received our Common Stock as
consideration or by investors who has previously acquired such Common Stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common
Stock. 

Due
to recent changes to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our Common Stock may become subject to limitations or reductions
on stock price, liquidity, or volume. 

On
September 16, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ).
This Rule applies to broker-dealers who quote securities listed on over-the-counter markets such as our Common Stock. The Rule as amended
prohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations on OTC markets for an issuer s securities unless they are based on current
publicly available information about the issuer. When it becomes effective, the amended Rule will also limit the Rule s piggyback 
exception, which allows broker-dealers to publish quotations for a security in reliance on the quotations of a broker-dealer that initially
performed the information review required by the Rule, to issuers with current publicly available information or issuers that are up-to-date
in their Exchange Act reports. As of this date, we are uncertain as what actual effect the Rule may have on us. 

The
Rule changes could harm the liquidity and/or market price of our Common Stock by either preventing our shares from being quoted or driving
up our costs of compliance. Because we are a voluntary filer under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and not a public reporting company,
the practical impact of these changes is to require us to maintain a level of periodic disclosure we are not presently required to maintain,
which would cause us to incur material additional expenses. Further, if we cannot or do not provide or maintain current public information
about our company, our stockholders may face difficulties in selling their shares of our Common Stock at desired prices, quantities,
or times, or at all, as a result of the amendments to the Rule.

7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company has no operations or revenue as of the date of this Report. We are currently in the process of developing a business plan. Management
intends to explore and identify viable business opportunities within the U.S. including seeking to acquire a business in a reverse merger.
Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties
which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and
global economies. For more information about the risk of Covid-19 on our business, see Item 1.A. - Risk Factors . 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company has no operations from a continuing business other than the expenditures related to running the Company and has no revenue from
continuing operations as of the date of this Report. 

Management
intends to explore and identify business opportunities within the U.S., including a potential acquisition of an operating entity through
a reverse merger, asset purchase or similar transaction. Our Chief Executive Officer has experience in business consulting, although
no assurances can be given that he can identify and implement a viable business strategy or that any such strategy will result in profits.
Our ability to effectively identify, develop and implement a viable plan for our business may be hindered by risks and uncertainties
which are beyond our control, including without limitation, the continued negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. and
global economies. For more information about the risk of coronavirus on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors. 

We
do not currently engage in any business activities that provide revenue or cash flow. During the next 12-month period we anticipate incurring
costs in connection with investigating, evaluating, and negotiating potential business combinations, filing SEC reports, and consummating
an acquisition of an operating business. 

Given
our limited capital resources, we may consider a business combination with an entity which has recently commenced operations, is a developing
company or is otherwise in need of additional funds for the development of new products or services or expansion into new markets, or
is an established business experiencing financial or operating difficulties and needs additional capital. Alternatively, a business combination
may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, an entity which desires access to the U.S. capital markets. 

As
of the date of this Report, our management has not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a potential
business combination. Any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development. In such
event, we expect to be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or early-stage entity.
In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk or in which our
management has limited experience, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

19 

Our
management anticipates that we will likely only be able to effect one business combination due to our limited capital. This lack of diversification
will likely pose a substantial risk in investing in the Company for the indefinite future, because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture or operating territory against gains from another. The risks we face will likely be heightened to the extent
we acquire a business operating in a single industry or geographical region. 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be a complex and risk-prone process. Because of general economic conditions,
including unfavorable conditions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages
of available capital, management believes that there are several firms seeking business opportunities at this time at discounted rates
with which we will compete. We expect that any potentially available business combinations may appear in a variety of different industries
or regions and at various stages of development, all of which will likely render the task of comparative investigation and analysis of
such business opportunities extremely difficult and complicated. 

Once
we have developed and begun to implement our business plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination
of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in
line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

Based
upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. If we are able
to close a reverse merger, it is likely we will need capital as a condition of closing that acquisition. Because of the uncertainties,
we cannot be certain as to how much capital we need to raise or the type of securities we will be required to issue. In connection with
a reverse merger, we will be required to issue a controlling block of our securities to the target s shareholders which will be
very dilutive. 

Additional
issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to our Common Stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms,
or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective
new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

We
anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months, principally costs related to our being obligated to file reports
with the SEC. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in
their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition
of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement, and successfully
execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

COVID-19
Update 

To
date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our current lack of operations. The pandemic
may, however, have an impact on our ability to evaluate and acquire an operating entity through a reverse merger or otherwise. See Item
1A Risk Factors for more information. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or
future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Going
Concern 

The
independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our January 31, 2023 financial statements contained
an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and
satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders Board of Directors 

 LVPAI Group Limited 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
LVPAI Group Limited as of January 31, 2023 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements for the years then ended. In our opinion, the
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #1 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited
operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the shareholders and the board of directors of
Lvpai Group Limited 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of
Lvpai Group Limited (the Company as of January 31, 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders equity
(deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January
31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company s significant
operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. 

We determined that there are no critical audit
matters.

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

shares of Series A Preferred Stock, par value per share (the
 Shares of the Company were transferred from Custodian Ventures, LLC to Yang Fuzhu (the Purchaser ). Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible to shares of common stock. As a result, the Purchaser became an approximately 
holder of the voting rights of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis of the Company, and became
the controlling shareholder. The consideration paid for the Shares was . The source of the cash consideration for the Shares
was personal funds of the Purchaser. In connection with the transaction, David Lazar released the Company from in debt owed to
him. 

On
January 25, 2021, David Lazar, serving as a director and an officer, ceased to be the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary, and a Director. At the effective date of the transfer, Yang Fuzhu consented to act
as the new President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. 

The
Company s accounting year-end is January 31. 

. 

Because
the Company does not expect that existing operational cash flow will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations, this raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company will need to raise additional
funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing. Prior to August 12, 2022 when a change of control in the Company
occurred, the Company had been being funded by Mr. Fuzhu Yang who extended interest-free demand loans to the Company. Historically, the
Company has raised capital through private placements, as an interim measure to finance working capital needs and may continue to raise
additional capital through the sale of common stock or other securities and obtaining some short-term loans. The Company will be required
to continue to so until its operations become profitable. Also, the Company has, in the past, paid for consulting services with its common
stock to maximize working capital, and intends to continue this practice where feasible.

Mr.
Fuzhu Yang, the Company s former chief executive officer and chief financial officer the principal member of the Company s
Court-appointed custodian is considered a related party. During the year ended January 31, 2023, he extended in interest free
demand loans to the Company.

The Company s board of directors has the authority,
without further action by stockholders, to issue up to shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Company s
board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights,

the conversion, there were shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The par value remains unchanged at per share,
which resulted in a reclassification of capital from par value to additional paid-in capital in excess of par value. All share and per

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer
or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
 assets; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
 of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has
concluded that as of January 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

The
 Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one officer and limited resources. 

The
 Company does not have an independent board of directors or an audit committee. 

The
 Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

All
 of the Company s financial reporting is carried out by a financial consultant. 

We
plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors, establishing written policies and procedures for
our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger
or similar business acquisition. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

There
have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
