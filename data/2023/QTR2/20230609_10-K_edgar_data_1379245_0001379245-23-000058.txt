 CORPORATE HISTORY 
 
 Formation and Development 
 
 The Company was incorporated in Nevada on September 30, 2005, and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Formerly PearTrack Security Systems, Inc., the Company s name was changed to Enigma-Bulwark, Ltd., on October 9, 2019, pursuant to a majority of the Company s shareholders and unanimous resolution of the board of directors. 
 
 Enigma-Bulwark, Ltd. Enigma or Company is a security and risk management company that provides physical security, technology-systems integration, and risk management advisory services. Services offered to assess and mitigate risk include security guards, risk management analysis, and proprietary and third-party technology and software. Target markets include corporations, governments and individuals across the globe. 
 
 During 2016 through 2018, the Company sought financing for the further development of its intellectual property, including the finalization of the PearLoxx container locking and tracking prototype, and the commercialization of an updated PearTrack platform and tracking system. In addition, strategic acquisitions were pursued to expand the Company s intellectual property portfolio. 
 
 Due to the Company s inability to successfully commercialize the PearTrack intellectual property acquired in 2013 (the PearTrack IP ), all rights, title and interest in the PearTrack IP reverted to the former licensees on December 31, 2018, and, pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement, the related Note issued to the licensors (the Note Holders was canceled. In addition, all rights to future royalties collectible under any sub-license previously issued by the Company for the PearTrack IP reverted to the Note Holders. As a result, in 2018, the Company recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of 2,000,000. 
 
 Although the PearTrack IP commercialization was unsuccessful, the Company continued to focus on security and risk management, and acquired intellectual property that is based on a patent-pending 1 interactive spontaneous video security technology (the Safer IP ). On October 11, 2018, the Company executed an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement (the Safer Agreement with Safer, Inc., a Florida corporation (the Seller ), for the acquisition of the Safer IP. Pursuant to the Safer Agreement, in exchange for all rights, title and interest in the Safer IP, among other things, the Company delivered to Seller: 
 
 1. Common Stock Purchase Agreement providing for the Seller the right to purchase 3,500,000 shares of the Company s restricted Common Stock at a price of 0.001 per share, for 3,500 cash; and 
 2. Revenue Sharing Agreement providing for a cash earn-out of 3 to be paid to the Seller, up to 1,000,000 paid to Seller, derived from the Adjusted Gross Revenue generated by the Company in connection with the Safer IP; and 
 3. Royalty Agreement providing for a royalty of 1.5 of the Adjusted Gross Revenue generated by the Company in connection with the Safer IP. 
 
 1 On July 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office that its Patent Application 16/618,038 Network Based Video Surveillance and Logistics for Multiple Users was granted and would be issued to the Company. For additional information on the patent application, see Intellectual Property

 In 2019, the Company was presented with an opportunity to start a security and risk management business headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa, and identified key management to operate the business unit. On August 30, 2019, the Company formed Enigma-Bulwark Risk Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary EBRM ), to maintain the Company s security and risk management operations and assets. 
 
 In addition, EBRM acquired 100 of the shares of Enigma-Bulwark Security, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed by the Company in May 2019 EBS ). The Company attracted key senior management talent with backgrounds in structured finance, insurance, management, and M A. On August 8, 2019, EBS received its license to provide physical security officers from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and commenced its security protection operations in southern Florida, providing security services to the hospitality industry, as well as large events and VIPs/celebrities. 
 
 As part of the development of the South African business unit, the Company, through EBRM, entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the JV Agreement on September 8, 2020, with Prime African Security, Ltd., a South African corporation Prime ), to provide security and risk management services in South Africa. The joint venture formed Prime Enigma Africa (Pty) Ltd., a South African corporation (the Joint Venture ), for which Prime owns 51 of the Common Stock and the Company owns 49 . The JV Agreement is for an initial term of three (3) years, and automatically renews unless canceled in writing by either party. 
 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 In December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, former President Donald J. Trump declared the virus a national emergency in the United States. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the WHO reports over 757 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6.8 million deaths worldwide, including over 1.1 million in the U.S. This highly contagious disease has spread to most of the countries in the world and throughout the United States, creating a serious impact on customers, workforces and suppliers, disrupting economies and financial markets, and potentially leading to a world-wide economic downturn. It has caused a disruption of the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the Company s clients operations, its employees and its employee productivity. It may also impact the ability of the Company s subcontractors, partners, and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in costs, delays or disruptions in performance. These effects, and the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on the Company s employees and operations, may negatively impact both the Company s ability to meet customer demand and its revenue and profit margins. The Company s employees, in many cases, are working remotely and using various technologies to perform their functions. The Company might experience delays or changes in customer demand, particularly if customer funding priorities change. Further, in reaction to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, many businesses have instituted social distancing policies, including the closure of offices and worksites and deferring planned business activity. Additionally, the disruption and volatility in the global and domestic capital markets may increase the cost of capital and limit the Company s ability to access capital. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light if the coronavirus pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures expand, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its business operations, revenues and financial condition; however, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change.

 Seeking Strategic Opportunities 

Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, EBRM, the Company is operating a security and risk management business, and developing its proprietary, patent-pending and patented technology. EBRM is focused on providing security guards, both armed and unarmed, as well as security consulting and systems integration of security technology and software through the development of its patent-pending intellectual property (see Intellectual Property ), along with third-party Plug-N-Play products. 
 
 In August 2019, the Company, through EBRM s subsidiary, Enigma-Bulwark Security, Inc. EBS ), a Delaware corporation, established and operates a full-service security business targeting hospitality, corporate/executives, and petroleum assets. in Miami, Florida. EBS services include security guards, both armed and unarmed, as well as CCTV and video capture technology and security consulting services. As of October 2022, EBS maintains a staff of approximately forty-five (45) employees, including over forty (40) fully licensed security personnel, serving eleven (11) luxury and boutique hotels, restaurants and resorts in the greater Miami Beach, Florida, area. 
 
 In August 2020, EBRM formed a joint venture with Prime African Security, Ltd. Pty, a Pretoria, South Africa based full-service security company, accredited under the Private Security Industry Regulation Act 56 of 2001 (PSIRA), called Prime-Enigma Africa Ltd. Pty Prime-Enigma headquartered in Pretoria, South Africa. Prime-Enigma is currently bidding on security tenders from large international corporations operating in South Africa. 
 
 The Company also intends to provide a unique solution to security issues in the intermodal shipping container marketplace, with its patented container tracking and locking system, EnigmaLok (formerly PearLoxx), the rights of which were licensed to the Company in perpetuity in 2015 (see Intellectual Property ). 
 
 Through the subsidiaries, Ecologic Car Rentals, Inc. and Ecologic Products, Inc., the Company continues its pursuits for strategic opportunities for its shareholders, as management believes that the brands have value for companies with environmentally-friendly consumer-related products and services. 
 
 Business Strategy 
 
 In today s complex and connected world, the Company believes that a holistic approach to risk management analysis is an essential component of business and life. The traditional idea of simply placing a guard at a post and using pen-and-paper systems has proven to simply be inadequate in this advanced and fast-paced society, and is precisely why technology needs to be adopted in private security. 
 
 The Company s goal is to establish a worldwide security firm that provides the highest level of security protocols, capabilities and solutions to individuals, companies, and governments. The Company s initial security operations service luxury hotels and resorts, events, and celebrities in the Miami Beach, Florida, area. The remaining operations are at various stages of development, ranging from commercial stage technology testing to early and mid-development stage, with about 25 of Enigma s value proposition at the research and development stage. As such, the Company will require additional investment capital to successfully implement its business strategy and fund the completion of its product development. There can be no assurance that such financing will become available or, if it does, that it will be offered to the Company on favorable terms. 
 
 The Company believes that the Miami, Florida, operations will be an ideal market entry point for its other security offerings, such as its Smart Video products. Management intends to utilize the Miami operations as a test market for these security technologies, of which the resulting data will prove invaluable in the Company s larger scale marketing endeavors. Enigma is targeting a wide range of industries, and is positioned to grow its business through the exploitation of its intellectual property and integrated solutions.

Physical security refers to restricting physical access of unauthorized people in controlled facilities to prevent damage to valuable hardware, software, network infrastructure, and other assets. Physical security includes security layers that protect personnel, network, and data in physical facilities, such as campuses, buildings, banks, and offices, from internal or external physical threats, such as natural disasters, fire, theft, burglary, vandalism, and terrorist attacks. 2 
 
 The physical security segment of the security industry is undergoing the most rapid technological change in its history. Today, a combination of technologies and services are transforming the delivery of physical security services, such as: 
 
 rising Internet Protocol (IP) adoption 
 declining legacy sales 
 emerging communication standards from broadband to 5G to Wi-Max 
 acceptance of security technologies as a service. 
 
 While physical security will always be an important barrier against enterprise theft, vandalism, and violence, cybersecurity continues to be the top security concern businesses face today, with a persistent and ever-growing threats. With the developments of cyber hacking, and recent global hijacking of major corporations infrastructures, the need for advanced security systems and technologies is at its greatest. To meet these demands, emerging technologies and concepts, such as artificial intelligence AI ), cloud computing, intelligent video analytics, and cybersecurity are at the forefront of the security industry. As companies plan to meet the threats of the future, budgets for security systems of all sizes are increasing, and are focused on innovative solutions. 
 
 The Company has a developed a strategic plan that will initially incorporate (i) a hybrid systems-integration business model, based on third-party products and services, and (ii) a recurring revenue subscription model, based on the exploitation of its proprietary intermodal container products and services. As the Company moves from equipment sales to consultative solution sales, the unique business problems of clients in target markets will be a primary focus. The Company is identifying vertical market initiatives that will concentrate its expertise. 
 
 System Integration 
 
 The Company is developing a business unit focused on providing technology-based security solutions through systems integration. System integration is defined simply as the process of bringing together the component sub-stems into one system. 3 Through system integration, the Company can provide a platform for both third-party technology as well as proprietary products, to be sold to clients through multiple business models, ranging from Security as a Service (SaaS) to direct product sales. 
 
 Integration between video and access control is the most sought-after combination. This leads to integration issues, as most manufacturers offer integrations with a variety of video and other security components but not with their fellow access control competitors. Additionally, vendors use their own unique application program interfaces and their own databases with reporting methods that make the integration process challenging. Having qualified System Integrators is essential to solving these issues.

 A System Integrator is an individual or (company) that specializes in bringing together component subsystems into a whole, ensuring that those subsystems function together. 4 A security system integrators SSI ), for example, can configure a central command-and-control center with a common user interface that shares data. SSIs can also solve issues such as joining disparate security and non-security components so they communicate with each other properly. 
 
 Even as technology changes, the main objective of system integration remains the same: to seamlessly coordinate and link various security sub-systems to impede ever-increasing security threats. To meet these objectives, the SSIs engaged by the Company will have expertise installing and managing access control elements like gates, doors, and locks, video surveillance systems, emergency notification systems, lighting, network security and more. 
 
 The Company will initially outsource its system integration needs by contracting with SSIs on a per project basis. An experienced SSI can help oversee the full lifecycle of a client s security systems. Additionally, SSIs can custom-design a security plans, as well as install, implement, test, manage and maintain it. Through the development of relationships with select SSIs, and proven success on multiple projects, the Company will recruit key SSIs that have the qualifications and competencies that best suit the Company s needs on an exclusive and permanent basis. 
 
 With the advent of AI, remote and sensor video analytics, cloud computing, and cybersecurity new opportunities open for the Company s system integration model. The Company believes that it is not whether technology will have a significant impact on the physical security industry in the next few years; it is which technology will prove the most valuable. With the rapid pace of change in technology, there is no simple answer to this question. The business challenges of yesterday may no longer be the challenges of tomorrow. The Company realizes the need to understand what the unique challenges are for each vertical it focuses on, and work with manufacturers to develop proprietary initiatives and provide proven solutions for specific markets.

 Future Technology Concepts and Strategies 
 
 The shifts in technologies identify opportunities to generate new business through the introduction of value-added applications, or new services capable of generating recurring monthly revenue. The Company s goal is to have the following technologies installed either separately or collectively, as part of an integrated offering: 
 
 Artificial Intelligence and Analytics 
 Clients are looking to AI and data analytics to gain better insight into their operations. These offerings can provide security-related intelligence or operational and customer insights. The key to AI is a self-learning algorithm that, over time, gets better at identifying certain targeted behaviors or transactions, and reduces false positives. The challenge for clients will be clearly defining which data is most valuable to them, who will have access to it, and how to best manage it. The Company can play a key role in this process by having those discussions with clients up front and encouraging a proof-of-concept phase before full rollouts are undertaken. 
 Facial Recognition 
 Facial recognition is growing in popularity among biometric forms of authentication. Microsoft has enabled it for access with Hello for Windows 10 users, major credit card companies have stated their interest in using facial recognition to verify payments and other financial institutions are using it to authenticate customers on mobile devices. Still, it s use spotting suspects in crowds and protecting airports and borders remains the brass ring for security professionals. 
 Security as a Service (SaaS) 
 The security market has seen an increased demand for Security-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings. The combination of low, upfront capital costs, along with outsourced services, has made cloud-based video and access-control popular, especially in the hospitality and small-to-medium enterprise markets. As technology developers add more sophisticated applications and services to expand client insights and efficiencies, enterprise retail clients will seek SaaS more and more. Developed as a subscription business model, SaaS generates a recurring revenue stream. 
 Cybersecurity 
 The sheer scope and size of the data breaches the Company has witnessed over the past decade is a daunting reality. The breach of Equifax, one of the most notable examples, has heightened concerns over cyber-preparedness. In turn, clients are increasingly evaluating their level of cybersecurity preparedness, as well as that of their suppliers. The Company s initial strategy in the cybersecurity market will be to partner with an established cybersecurity company that provides leading-edge tools and solutions. 
 
 The execution of the Company s business strategy will be contingent upon and require significant financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will become available or, if it does, that it will be offered to the Company on favorable terms.

In-Sourcing 
 
 Many clients worldwide seek support to manage security-related projects on a temporary or permanent basis. Companies often lack the in-house capability to satisfy all security requirements. Enigma can fill this shortfall by deploying embedded consultants for a specific task, and passing on sector-specific knowledge that clients may not possess in-house. These consultants provide professional advice, tailoring strategies and tactics based on the Company s intimate understanding of the Company s clients operating environments. 
 
 Out-Sourcing 
 
 Enigma is well positioned to provide a global solution for corporations that require occasional support or longer-term solutions in several areas: 
 
 Close protection details 
 Armed protection teams in high-risk environments 
 Security awareness training 
 Intrusion testing 
 Technical surveillance countermeasures 
 Major event security 
 
 The Company s experienced professionals can provide security and peace of mind for those traveling in hostile, unfamiliar environments. By providing specialty security services, the Company can help to keep clients most valuable assets safe and secure. 
 
 Project Management in Hostile Environments 
 
 The Company s team Project Managers PMs have spent years in their respective fields, deployed primarily in hostile areas such as the Middle East and West Africa. PMs will handle projects from inception to execution stage, and approach each project as a unique opportunity. To fulfill a client s requirements, PMs will harness on industry best practices and personal experience, augmenting a client s needs by satisfying the following project requirements: 
 
 Initiate a project in a very hostile environment with seemingly no budgets and resources. 
 Prioritize problems and focus slender resources on the most critical tasks. 
 Carefully organize individuals into groups that can work on specific activities based on their skill sets and create a unified high performance project team. 
 Enable in-built agility to survive interruptions and attempts to shut it down. 
 Utilize knowledge areas (integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resource, communications, risk, procurement) to intuitively initiate, plan and execute project. 
 
 Security System Audits 
 
 Security measures are of little use if they are not enforced. A security audit assesses how effectively an organization s security policies are being implemented. The Company can perform audits that will show a client where gaps and vulnerabilities might exist in their current systems and procedures. 
 
 Over these years, the Company s experienced team of security specialists have seen countless reasons for non-compliance with existing security procedures. Some protocols may be bypassed for the sake of convenience, or a perception of increased productivity. Other times, there is a resistance to change, or merely forgetfulness or carelessness. Multinational companies and those with multiple facilities can find it especially challenging to institute system-wide compliance with security procedures. 
 
 With the Company s anticipated global footprint, it will have the resources to not only uncover where weaknesses and security gaps exist throughout an organization, but also what issues are driving non-compliance. The Company can then help establish a balanced and effective security risk management program that a client can be comfortable and confident with. This exercise can be especially beneficial after an acquisition for standardizing policies and procedures. 
 
 The Company s security audits can also play an important role in internal investigations when anomalies are discovered, or wrongdoing is suspected. The Company s findings can be used for not only potential litigation/legal proceedings, but also to strengthen an organization s internal controls to mitigate future problems. 
 
 Security and Emergency Programs 
 
 An effective security program must cover many scenarios and clearly define the duties and expectations for everyone in an organization from the security department to management and employees, as well as third parties like local emergency responders and business continuity partners. By taking a multidisciplinary approach, the Company can review current security policies to ensure they cover current risks and vulnerabilities, and offer the best way to handle security and surveillance systems. 
 
 The Company can develop security policies tailored to the exact risks a client or organization faces all within the framework of laws and regulations of each country in which it operates. Depending on specific needs, the Company can assist with either comprehensive security programs or individual components, such as access control, workplace violence prevention, or executive protection.

 Security Equipment Sourcing 
 
 The Company can recommend and help individuals and organizations source any needed security equipment. The Company has industry partners both within and outside its countries of operation with whom it can collaborate with for security equipment sourcing services. 
 
 Fraud Prevention and Ethics Programs 
 
 Regardless of size, all organizations are vulnerable to workplace fraud. Fraud can take many forms including embezzlement, forgery, theft of inventory and other assets, and computer crime and can continue unchecked for years. The financial impact can be devastating. 
 
 Although the Company believes preventing fraud is a good starting point for companies that want to improve or review their loss prevention strategies, it is not a substitute for expert advice. The Company encourages clients to seek appropriate professional advice for any specific issues that may arise when designing, implementing or reviewing loss prevention strategies. 
 
 RISK MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES 
 
 Since all threats are dynamic, the intelligence cycle never truly ends, and new or evolving threats must continually be identified and investigated. As criminal trends and geopolitical developments continue to pose physical security threats to organizations in a wide range of sectors, the intelligence cycle reinforces the critical, yet often overlooked, importance of context and subject matter expertise in addressing these challenges. The convergence of the digital and physical world is increasingly being tested to manage a diverse range of incidents ranging from extreme weather, malicious cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, facility invasions, theft, vandalism, and many additional applications. Enigma uses a holistic approach to address all aspects of a client s security and operational risks for the most effective protection. Diverse skill sets and global resource relationships enable the Company s experts to manage projects from inception to completion. From securing counterfeit goods along the supply chain, to running drills to perfect executive protection in unstable locations, the Company s prompt response capabilities will deliver quality services across the entire security risk management continuum. 
 
 Because security risks are interconnected and ever-evolving, the Company can provide up-to-date advice on a wide range of security services to effectively manage risks. In addition, the Company can identify physical security weaknesses, focus on defined threats that could compromise a company s ability to provide adequate services to its clients, and provide a roadmap for remediating security vulnerabilities. 
 
 Corporate and Industrial 
 
 Bomb threats, workplace violence, stalkers, corporate espionage, supply chain disruption, and extortion. These dangers and more can arise without warning. The Company has the resources and expertise to analyze risks, identify suspects, develop intervention strategies, mitigate threats, and ultimately help you manage and resolve a wide variety of corporate and private client corporate security issues. 
 
 Risk, Threat Assessments and Defensive Strategy Development 
 
 Comprehensive threat and vulnerability assessments are essential to securing an organization. The security risk assessment process can help to identify all critical assets, assess the likelihood of known threats, evaluate existing countermeasures, and develop a prioritized plan to reduce risk. Through the Company s multidisciplinary approach, security is measured from every angle to mitigate risks from the physical environment to the human element, and the role of technology. 
 
 Effective security starts with a clear understanding of vulnerabilities. The Company can help gauge strengths and weaknesses in a wide variety of scenarios, and help anticipate potential sources of new threats. The Company s vulnerability assessment methodology begins with an in-depth security review. No matter the focus of the assessment, the Company applies a time-tested methodology where: 
 
 current areas of exposure and any past security incidents are reviewed in order to identify potential vulnerabilities. 
 employees and other key individuals are interviewed for critical insights and information about situations, policies, and procedures. 
 a gap analysis is prepared to isolate areas where security protocols do not meet industry best practices. 
 recommendations are made and measures are implemented to mitigate any areas of vulnerability. 
 
 Security Awareness and Training Activities 
 
 Companies are realizing that an ethical and fiduciary responsibility exists to protect employees, customers, and others from physical harm. Demonstrating a commitment to security and the employee experience also reduces costs, maintains employee morale and retention, and improves customer perception. 
 
 All employers have both an ethical and legal duty of care towards their employees. The Company offers a wide range of training solutions that can assist employers in fulfilling this duty by preparing their staff for possible security issues, especially while travelling to or working in unfamiliar, medium or high-risk countries.

 Today s security professional can now access high-performance apps from their mobile phone or tablet, which enhances productivity, accountability, and access to vital information. The Safer Security System Mobile Application Safer Mobile App allows for an unlimited number of persons to connect to a centralized location, and the person or persons at a centralized location can have real-time visibility to events occurring and assess the current situation. The Safer Mobile App and security system provides real-time information, including: 
 
 Data collection . The Safer Mobile App allow security officers to capture data in real time. Automated instructions and questions can be set up for security professionals to answer at each checkpoint, such as entrances, escalators, and emergency callboxes. For example, a security professional on daily tours can be prompted monthly to document fire extinguishers inspection dates, essentially combining two tasks, and providing additional value. 
 
 Streamlined reporting . Data obtained at checkpoints can be visually analyzed to identify operational risks in addition to written reports from the security guard. These risks might include policy issues, such as specific doors repeatedly being left unlocked; safety issues, such as recurring hazards at specific elevators; or maintenance needs, such as inoperative callboxes. 
 
 Actionable information . Safer supports security strategy and enables optimized security officer deployments, precise post orders, directives for specific threats and countermeasure deployment to enhance security in areas where it is needed most. For example, incident management systems can identify sites and time ranges of incident volume based on historical data in the system. This can help determine security staffing levels and result in safer facilities and improved risk mitigation, reducing costs to the facility. 
 
 The Company s business ecosystems today include monitoring and response centers that provide an abundance of tools and technologies including threat intelligence platforms, remote video and alarm and event monitoring to traditional alarms and remote audio and positioning based patrol route management. Effective communication is critical to maximizing the efficiency and productivity of cutting-edge ecosystems to achieve optimum outcome that ensures enhanced safety and security. 
 
 Mass Notification Capabilities 
 
 For vital, time-sensitive messages, security professionals rely on mass notification apps to allow them to communicate real-time with any number of people using a text alert, voice message, or email message with digital signage and other customized channels so that the message can be shared instantly. 
 
 Mass notification alerts are also used to protect people from any number of hazards and emergencies, such as a flash flood warning for people traveling near a suddenly dangerous roadway, or a wildfire alert where flames could be creeping dangerously close to a road or housing community. These mass notification apps go beyond two-way communication to provide a full critical communications cycle that initiates an organization s emergency response plan s predefined crisis communication plan. 
 
 Security professionals and administrators can send notifications to thousands of people within seconds. They can initiate requests for help, reply to messages and actively monitor the well-being of their clients from a front-line perspective. 
 
 Integrating Safer into a mass notification Mobile App network affords centralized reverse real-time situational analysis that will allow professional to get out their messages and conversely be able to geo locate and identify persons in an area of interest and communicate the need to have the individual capture real-time video of their surroundings

 The major hindrance in the growth of physical security market is privacy. With the increasing adoption of video surveillance, concerns have been raised as to the misuse of video and privacy violations. Various civil liberties groups and activists are opposed to video surveillance. It has been suggested that organizations take necessary steps to lower the impact of video surveillance systems on the privacy of people, by issuing guidelines such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With the introduction of GDPR in Europe, any public or private organization using CCTV to monitor public accessible areas must adhere to the regulatory requirements. 
 
 Unlawful surveillance continues to be a major concern in the United States, and the federal government and most states have enacted legislation that criminalizes recording communications without obtaining consent from either one or all of the parties, depending on statute. A number of states, including California, Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois have enacted discrete laws pertaining to surveillance, including location tracking, drone photography, and even smart TV snooping features. 17 
 
 Security Guard Industry Challenges 
 
 One of the largest challenges of the security guard industry is hiring qualified security guards and back-office staff who understand how to use technology effectively. While not all companies are in a position to hire new workers, technology training is essential for ultimate success and competitive edge. The use of real time activity feeds, live metrics, tracking devices, and other technological advances will spread quickly through the security guard industry. Companies that implement it properly will thrive, while those who are unprepared for the changes technology brings or simply refuse to implement it will struggle. 
 
 By implementing high-quality technology and offering training and learning resources to their employees, companies can make the transition go more smoothly so that their team is better able to adapt to the new system and deliver better results. 
 
 An increased demand for security guard companies also means that more companies will need to look for new workers as they expand their business. Finding the best employees is a challenge, especially in an environment where workers are in high demand. Although expanding companies should not delay the process of increasing staff, the should also thoroughly vet potential employees before adding them to a security guard team.

Video Security Challenges 18 
 
 Despite the high growth rate of the video security market, there are significant challenges, including price erosion, cyber-security attacks on video surveillance equipment, component shortages and increased barriers to international trade to some countries. Increased tariffs and the banning of large vendors in the international market have contributed to the market barriers. In fact, the US government banned the use of products from two of the largest global manufacturers, Hikvision and Dahua. 
 
 Other challenges facing the video security market include the need for a skilled workforce, and concerns about privacy. 
 
 Shipping Container Industry Challenges 
 
 There are several key challenges facing the cargo shipping market. It is expected that over 860 million shipping containers will be transported throughout the globe in 2021 19 , transporting raw materials and manufactured goods across the continents. The overwhelming amount of shipping containers has resulted in a more complex and less transparent supply chain network, leading to: 
 Increased dwell-time of containers at each location. 
 Increased labor-costs and human interventions. 
 Increased risks for delay, damage, spoilage and theft. 
 
 Cargo thefts is a global issue. Unmonitored containers maybe be subjected to hostile human interventions throughout the shipping process. In the United States alone, there were an estimated 870 cargo thefts in 2020 worth over 145 billion, representing an increase in volume of 23 , and an increase in value of 41 , from 2019, and the highest increases since 2015. A significant cause of the 2020 increases was the COVID pandemic, accounting for an estimated 43 of total thefts. 20 These stolen goods are then resold back to the market or used for counterfeiting and other purposes, resulting in: 
 
 Increased financial loss 
 Increased insurance rate 
 Increased risk for of damages to brand-image 
 Increased risk of market disturbance 
 
 Despite the heavy ow of containers ooding into ports every day, only 3 of these containers are physically inspected before entering the country 21 . Since 9/11, concerns have been raised that terrorists can potentially take advantage of the aws in supply chains, utilizing unmonitored containers against national interests. In addition to suspecting the threat of a weapon of mass destruction arriving in a shipping container at a port, many also suspect that the money generated by organized cargo theft is being funneled back to fund terrorists activities, causing: 
 
 Increased risks of terrorists smuggling mass destruction weapons and illegal dangerous goods 
 Increased risk of bombs threatening the port security 
 Increased the vulnerability of national security

 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 
 The Company s operations will be subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and controls. The Company believes it is in compliance with any such regulations affecting its business. 
 
 While the United States has no plenary data protection regulator, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority is very broad, and often sets the tone on federal privacy and data security issues. In addition, a variety of other agencies regulate data protection through sectoral laws, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of Commerce. 
 
 Federal Trade Commission Act 25 
 
 The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S Code 41 et seq.) broadly empowers the FTC to bring enforcement actions to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive practices and to enforce federal privacy and data protection regulations. The FTC has taken the position that deceptive practices include a company s failure to comply with its published privacy promises and its failure to provide adequate security of personal information, in addition to its use of deceptive advertising or marketing methods.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
 
 The increasing adoption of video surveillance has come with some opposition with regards to personal privacy rights. To address these concerns, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation on April 27, 2016 (formerly Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC), on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data The regulation became enforceable on May 25, 2018, and contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise regardless of its location and the data subjects citizenship or residence that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA. It has been suggested that U.S. organizations and individuals with video surveillance services issue similar guidelines. In fact, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), adopted on June 28, 2918, has many similarities with the GDPR. However, there is no single principal data protection legislation in the United States. Rather, various laws enacted at both federal and state levels serve to protect the personal data of U.S. residents. 
 
 Security and Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 
 
 The SAFE Port Act of 2006 was an Act of Congress in the United States covering port security. The bill calls for, among other thing, 100 of U.S.-bound Ocean containers to be scanned at the foreign port of origin. The bill was enacted and signed by former President George W. Bush on Oct 13, 2006. The bill became the law numbered Public Law 109-347. The DHS delayed the implementation of key sections of the SAFE Port Act of 2006 until 2016. 
 
 Container Security Initiative 
 
 The Container Security Initiative (the CSI was launched in 2002 by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection CBP ), an agency of the DHS. Its purpose was to increase security for container cargo shipped to the United States. The CSI allows Customs and Border protection (CBP ), working along with host government Customs Services, to examine high-risk maritime containerized cargo at foreign seaports, prior to being loaded on board vessels destined for the United States. 
 
 The CSI consists of four core elements: 
 
 Using intelligence and automated information, identify and target containers that pose a risk for terrorism. 
 Pre-screen containers that pose a risk at the port of departure before they arrive at U.S. ports. 
 Using detection technology, such as gamma ray detectors, quickly pre-screen containers that pose a risk. 
 Use smarter, tamper-evident containers. 
 
 The initial CSI program has focused on implementation at the top 20 ports that ship approximately two-thirds of the container volume to the United States. CSI is now operational at ports in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin and Central America. CBP s 58 operational CSI ports now prescreen over 80 percent of all maritime containerized cargo imported into the United States. Smaller ports have been added to the program at their instigation, and participation is open to any port meeting certain volume, equipment, procedural, and information-sharing requirements. Future plans include expansion to additional ports based on volume, location, and strategic concerns. 
 
 MANUFACTURING 
 
 In addition to system integration of third-party technologies for its security service offerings, the Company will identify third-party manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing for its hardware (EnigmaLok), and software (Safer Systems) products and technologies. 
 
 The Company will internally develop prototypes of its proprietary technology, and test features at prototype levels through the retention of independent contractors.

The Company s Common Stock is subject to rules adopted by the Commission regulating broker dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Those disclosure rules applicable to penny stocks require a broker dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized list disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 In December 2019, an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, former President Donald J. Trump declared the virus a national emergency in the United States. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the WHO reports over 757 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6.8 million deaths worldwide, including over 1.1 million in the U.S. This highly contagious disease has spread to most of the countries in the world and throughout the United States, creating a serious impact on customers, workforces and suppliers, disrupting economies and financial markets, and potentially leading to a world-wide economic downturn. It has caused a disruption of the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the Company s clients operations, its employees and its employee productivity. It may also impact the ability of the Company s subcontractors, partners, and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in costs, delays or disruptions in performance. These effects, and the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on the Company s employees and operations, may negatively impact both the Company s ability to meet customer demand and its revenue and profit margins. The Company s employees, in many cases, are working remotely and using various technologies to perform their functions. The Company might experience delays or changes in customer demand, particularly if customer funding priorities change. Further, in reaction to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, many businesses have instituted social distancing policies, including the closure of offices and worksites and deferring planned business activity. Additionally, the disruption and volatility in the global and domestic capital markets may increase the cost of capital and limit the Company s ability to access capital. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light if the coronavirus pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures expand, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its business operations, revenues and financial condition; however, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change.

 The Company s principal sources of funds have been from sales of the Company s Common Stock and loans from related parties. 
 
 Future Financings 
 
 The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations.

The Company anticipates that it will have to raise additional funds through private placements of the Company s equity securities and/or debt financing to complete its business plan. 
 
 The Company will require additional financing in the amount of approximately 5,000,000 in order to enable the Company to proceed with the Company s plan of operations, as discussed above, including an estimated 2,000,000 over the next 12 months, to pay for the Company s current and ongoing expenses and product development. These cash requirements include working capital, selling, general and administrative expenses, expansion of the Company s product line, and the pursuit of acquisitions. These cash requirements are in excess of the Company s current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, the Company will require additional financing in order to continue operations and to repay the Company s liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to the Company in order to enable the Company to sustain its plan of operations or to repay the Company s liabilities. There is no assurance that the financing will be completed as planned or at all. If the Company is unable to secure adequate capital to continue the Company s planned operations, the Company s shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and the Company s business may fail. 
 
 The Company anticipates continuing to rely on equity sales of the Company s Common Stock to fund the Company s business operations and product development. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to the Company s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional sales of its equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund the Company s planned business activities. 
 
 Personnel 
 
 The majority of personnel working with the Company are engaged as consultants under consulting agreements. 
 
 As of December 31, 2019, the Company engaged six (6) individuals, inclusive of two (2) and executive officers and directors. All personnel were full-time.

Contractual Obligations 
 
 The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in a current year net loss of 1,724,096, an accumulated deficit of 19,140,924, and a working capital deficit of 3,817,902, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, which may not be available at commercially reasonable terms There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise funds, in which case the Company may be unable to meet its obligations and the Company may cease operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The consolidated audited financial statements included with this Annual Report have been prepared on the going concern basis which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that the Company s assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, the consolidated audited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. The Company believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company s consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of its consolidated financial statements. The following should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : 
 
 Impairment reviews 
 Management is required to perform tests annually, or more often if necessary, for impairment of its finite lived and indefinite lived assets, to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 
 
 Impairment testing is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters, including management s expectations of: 
 
 growth in EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization; 
 long term growth rates; and 
 the selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved. 
 
 The Company may prepare financial projections to use as the basis for its impairment reviews. Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the projections, could significantly affect the Company s impairment evaluation and, hence, results. 
 
 The Company s review for impairment may also include the evaluation of key assumptions related to sensitivity in the projections, including estimates for varying levels of growth, such as aggressive, median, and conservative. In the Company s evaluation for impairment, the conservative level of growth would be utilized. For additional information, see Impairment of Long-Lived Assets under Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report.

 Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss of 1,724,096 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an accumulated deficit of 19,140,924, and a working capital deficit of 3,817,902, as of December 31, 2019 and further losses are anticipated. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1.

Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 During each of the Company s two most recent fiscal years and through the interim periods preceding the engagement of Assurance, the Company (a) has not engaged Assurance as either the principal accountant to audit the Company s financial statements, or as an independent accountant to audit a significant subsidiary of the Company and on whom the principal accountant is expected to express reliance in its report; and (b) has not consulted with Assurance regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Assurance concluding there was an important factor to be considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event, as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
 
 ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company s management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 As of December 31, 2019, the end of the Company s fiscal year covered by this report, and through December 31, 2022, the most recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the filing of this Annual Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Responsibility, estimates, and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of the Company s control procedures. The objectives of internal control include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, and through December 31, 2022, the most recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the filing of this Annual Report. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework . The Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, and through December 31, 2022, the most recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the filing of this Annual Report, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the Company generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s management reviewed the results of their assessment with the Company s board of directors. 
 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 
 
 Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 
 
 Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019, and through December 31, 2022, the most recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the filing of this Annual Report, that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

 3. Annual retainer for service as the Audit and Compensation Committee Chairpersons of 5,000. 
 4. Annual retainer for service as the Chairperson of any committee established by the Board, other than the Audit or Compensation Committee, of 2,500. 
 5. Reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with participation and/or attendance of Board and Committee meetings. 
 
 The Company has not paid any other cash compensation or directors fees for services rendered as a director since the Company s inception to the adoption of the DC Plan.

The OTC Pink on which shares of Common Stock are quoted does not have any director independence requirements. The NASDAQ definition of Independent Officer means a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
 
 As of December 31, 2019, the Company acted with eight directors, consisting of Mr. Clive Oosthuizen, Ms. Calli R. Bucci, Mr. John L. Ogden, Mr. E. William Withrow, Jr., Mr. William B. Nesbitt, Dr. Martin A. Blake, Mr. Philip J. Woolas, and Mr. David Rocke. The Company determined that Mr. John L. Ogden, Mr. William B. Nesbitt, Dr. Martin A. Blake, and Mr. Philip J. Woolas were independent director(s) as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15). 
 
 As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, the Company acts with five directors, consisting of Mr. Clive Oosthuizen, Mr. William B. Nesbitt, Dr. Martin A. Blake, Mr. Philip J. Woolas and Ms. Calli R. Bucci. The Company has determined that Mr. William B. Nesbitt, Mr. Philip J. Woolas and Dr. Martin A. Blake are independent director(s) as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).
