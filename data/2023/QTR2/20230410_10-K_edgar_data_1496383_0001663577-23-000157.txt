PART I 

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Business Overview 

ILUS is a Nevada corporation operating out of New York,
London, and Dubai, focused on adding shareholder value through innovation and growth. The company has acquired and incorporated businesses
in the global public safety and technology, engineering, and manufacturing industries. Historically, the company has evolved out of the
public safety sector mainly through the development and manufacture of Emergency Services products, including Emergency Response vehicles,
Special Vehicle conversions, Commercial EVs, and IoT Technology. ILUS also intends to acquire complimentary companies, which have disruptive
technology and strong management and potential for rapid growth that may benefit from cross pollination of territories, products, and
skills offered by our other group companies. 

ILUS functions as a holding company, which operates
through its subsidiaries within the public safety, technology, engineering, and manufacturing sectors. Our principal operating subsidiaries
and their respective businesses are discussed in detail below. ILUS wholly owns or has a controlling stake in each of its subsidiaries
which conduct their business operations with relative autonomy and are evaluated on their individual performance based upon the type of
products and services they offer. Our strategy is to acquire manufacturing capability, routes to market and technology advancements in
well-defined geographic, demographic and/or product niches within the business sectors that ILUS is focused on. 

Organizational Structure 

The below graphic shows our organizational structure, with ILUS
as the Parent company and operations primarily carried out through the operating subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are identified
in the figure below and are placed in three distinct divisions within their own existing or planned public companies, designed as Special
Purpose Vehicles (SPV s) formed to fulfil each division s specific business purpose and activity. A fourth defense division
has been incorporated is planned in line with potential future acquisitions that are contemplated for in this division, as well as acquisitions
contemplated for other divisions. We intend to disclose these acquisitions, as they happen, in our ongoing reports with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The divisions are listed below followed by the graphic: 

1. 
 Emergency Response 

2. 
 Industrial Manufacturing 

3. 
 Mining Renewable Energy

Intellectual Property 

The following overview concerns the intellectual property
matters of our company and its subsidiaries. Specific detail as to each subsidiary, if applicable, is contained in the section titled
 Our Operating Subsidiaries below. 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important
to our business and can provide us with a competitive advantage. We also rely on trade secrets, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing
technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. While the Company uses reasonable
efforts to protect its trade and business secrets, the Company cannot assure that its employees, consultants, contractors, or advisors
will not, unintentionally, or willfully, disclose the Company's trade secrets to competitors or other third parties. In addition, courts
outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, the Company's competitors may independently develop
equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. We periodically review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications,
in an effort to avoid infringement on third-party proprietary rights and protect our own, identify licensing or partnership opportunities
and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. Any infringement of the Company's proprietary rights could result in significant
litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect could result in the Company's competitors offering similar products, potentially
resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenue. 

Existing patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret
laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Company's proprietary rights to
the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, the Company may not be able to protect the Company's proprietary rights
against unauthorized third-party use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using the Company's trade secrets
could be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome of such a claim is unpredictable. Litigation may be necessary in the future to
protect the Company's trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially adversely affect the Company's future operating results. 

 We own a portfolio
of intellectual property in our group, including 3 patents in the operating company, FB Fire Technologies Ltd. (FireBug Group), as well
as confidential technical information and technological expertise in the manufacturing of firefighting technology. 

 While we consider
our patents to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent primarily on our patents or that our operations
are dependent upon any single patent to manufacture our products. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks. For
more information on these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

 The Company owns the
trademark ILUS.

Competition 

The following overview covers the competition we encounter
within markets we operate in and those we intend to expand into. Specific detail as to each subsidiary, if applicable, is contained in
the section titled Our Operating Subsidiaries below. 

The Public Safety Technology, Engineering, Industrial,
Manufacturing, Mining and Renewable Energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish
themselves within their markets and compete within their respective industry. While we do face intense competition in some divisions of
our business from companies that have been established long before ours and have a strong global reach, we have also developed our own
disruptive technology for which there is no known direct competition within that particular sector. We strive to advance our Technology,
Engineering Manufacturing capabilities in each sector ahead of our competitors to gain market share. Our ability to continue to
compete effectively also depends upon our ability to attract the required skills, as well as to retain and motivate our existing employees
and to compensate employees competitively. We believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably in our lines of business.
However, our industry is dominated by long-standing companies, and we are continuously strategizing to increase our market share. These
long-standing companies are often larger and have more resources to their disposable to retain market share. We believe that, in many
of the sectors where we operate, the technology offered by our competitors is outdated and we have a competitive advantage through the
innovative technology we offer.

The FireBug range of products consists of the
following: 

1. 
 MistNozzle handheld firefighting nozzles 

The MistNozzle handheld firefighting nozzles is a specialist
firefighting nozzle/branch, which produces a fine water mist enabling it to extinguish multiple classes of fires without the use of chemical
agents. The product is designed to increase efficiency, utilize less water, and increase fire fighter safety. The MistNozzle range is
designed, developed, and manufactured in the UK. It uses proven micron technology from the fire fixed suppression system industry. The
MistNozzle uses science in order to provide superior fire cooling and extinguishing. Its low-pressure water mist technology makes it more
efficient than comparative firefighting nozzles. The MistNozzle has one-click switch-function technology, allowing the user to easily
transition between Jet Mode and Water Mist Mode, minimizing room for error and ensuring safe mode selection. The plug-and-play functionality
of the MistNozzle works with most existing hose types on most existing fire trucks. The nozzle has been specifically designed for ease
of use with minimal training required for safe and effective use. With water being a valuable resource the world over, the MistNozzle
deliberately uses less water during operation. The water mist produced by the MistNozzle absorbs 2257kj of energy per liter verses conventional
technology which absorbs 335kj per liter. The MistNozzle also combats the effects of smoke within the fire environment, providing effective
and in some cases, lifesaving smoke scrubbing capability. 

2. 
 Mongoose external firefighting lance 

10 

 Table of Contents 

FireBug s Mongoose is a handheld firefighting
nozzle with an extension lance that allows it to be inserted from the exterior of a structure into an area such as a room (compartment)
in order to cool the area and suppress the fire. The Mongoose system is comprised of the water mist attack nozzle and a battery-operated
hole cutting drill. Either the drill or the firefighters compartment entry tools are used to breach the structure and create the necessary
hole through which the Mongoose is inserted. This method provides safer access to the compartment. The Mongoose has been designed to ensure
the correct kinetic energy will overcome the pressures created by the fire. Water mist droplets are transformed into steam by the heat
which consumes energy, removes oxygen, and consequently cools the gases and inhibits re-ignition. The Mongoose can deliver 40 50-micron
water mist droplets covering a large surface area into a compartment which rapidly cools the area, scrubs the smoke, and suppresses the
fire. The Mongoose is completely unique in that it can operate on an existing fire truck on existing hose lines, without requiring a separate
pump and hose reel. 

3. 
 MistMax and Maverick firefighting pumps 

FireBug s MistMax is a portable low-pressure
water mist fire suppression skid. The self-contained skid unit is designed to fit in a standard pick-up truck or on a UTV such as
the E-Raptor electric UTV. The MistMax is an easy-to-use, lightweight, and reliable solution which can be used by both non-technical operators
and experienced firefighters. The MistMax uses Firebug s proprietary technology including customized eductor mixer, a specialized
pulsating diaphragm pump, front winding geared hose reel, easy to use control panel, custom engineered baffled water tank and the Mini
MistNozzle which features Firebug s water stream colliding and atomizing technology. 

 FireBug s Maverick is a self-priming,
high-water volume, light portable pump which is designed as multi-purpose firefighting skid unit that can be portable or permanently fixed
in a firefighting vehicle. It has the capability to operate a hose reel or lay flat hose connected to a water supply tank or it can lift
water from an open water source or obtain it from a pressure fed supply such as a floating pump.

rapid response firefighting capabilities using either water, foam or additive. The BacPac system contains a sophisticated internal mechanical
rotor, which is used in the generation of WaterMist or foam (RAFS foam). The spindle and impellor rotate at high speeds mixing the foam
that allows optimum extinguishing. The device increases the range of the discharge by at least 200 and is 6 times more efficient than
any other known foam system, including CAFS.

During the past 18 months, Bull Head
Products faced some supply chain issues as a direct result of the disruption in supply chains across the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Whilst every effort is made to source materials from additional suppliers, this can sometimes lead to an increase in price. The company
has therefore increased its principal suppliers of raw materials to the following suppliers: 

Eastern Metal Supplies 

Tennessee Valley Fasteners 

Buyers Products Company 

Fastenal 

McMaster Carr

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits,
claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Aside from the below, we are not currently a party,
as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be
expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us. 

Ilustrato Pictures International Inc has applied to
the District Court, Clark County, Nevada to have 40,000,000 shares with Ambrose Keith cancelled as they were issued in error in
2018 as the deal never completed. The case has been won on September 15, 2022, in favor of the company and the court order was received
on January 23, 2023. The transfer agent cancelled the 40,000,000 shares on February 17, 2023. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by our former CEO, Larson Elmore. A case has been filed in the Eight Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (Case No. A-22-858343-C).
Plaintiff alleges that we breached a stock purchase agreement dated May 10, 2020, and promissory notes and is therefore entitled to damages.
We have potential counterclaims being prepared against the former CEO, arising due to improper action and lack of disclosures. The
company has disputed the claim and argue that Larson Elmore has been misleading the company and its shareholders on various matters including
but not limited to liabilities, company commitments and due diligence items presented by Larson Elmore during the takeover process. We
are in the process of a settlement discussion and have obtained an extension of time to respond while this process occurs. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by Steve Nicol, who claims that he loaned 12,000 to a subsidiary of ILUS under a promissory note, but that ILUS agreed to assume the
note. He further claims that he elected to convert the note and that ILUS failed to convert the note into shares of ILUS common stock.
He has alleged breach of contract, declaratory relief, and specific performance to require the company to issue 75,000,000 shares of common
stock in ILUS.

 Table of Contents 

We cannot predict whether this action involving our former CEO
or Mr. Nicol is likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to our company. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the
Company accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates based upon an analysis of potential
results and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period
could be affected by changes in assumption. 

We may continue to incur legal fees in responding to
this and other lawsuits. The expense of defending such litigation may be significant and any sizeable verdict may adversely affect the
company. The amount of time to resolve this and any additional lawsuits is unpredictable, and these actions may divert management s
attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
cash flows. 

Smaller Reporting Company 

The Company is a smaller reporting company 
as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including:
(1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive
compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As
long as we maintain our status as a smaller reporting company , these exemptions will continue to be available to us. 

Corporate History 

We were incorporated as Superior Venture Corp. on April
27, 2010, in the State of Nevada for the purpose of selling wine varietals. On November 9, 2012, we entered into an Exchange Agreement
with Ilustrato Pictures Ltd., a British Columbia corporation Ilustrato BC ), whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Ilustrato BC and the shareholders of Ilustrato BC received 1,200,000 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately
15 of our outstanding common stock following the acquisition. On November 30, 2012, Ilustrato BC transferred all of its assets and liabilities
to Ilustrato Pictures Limited, our wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong Ilustrato HK ). 

Ilustrato BC was in the business of developing, for
international release, feature theatrical films to be financed and distributed domestically by Chinese production companies.

limited liability company, and stockholder of the Company, filed an Application for Appointment of Custodian pursuant to Section 78.347
of the Nevada Revised Statutes in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada. Barton Hollow was subsequently appointed custodian of the
Company by Order of the Court on Apri1 5, 2016. In accordance with the provisions of the Order, Barton Hollow thereafter moved to reinstate
the Company with the State of Nevada, provide for the election of interim officers and directors, and call and hold a stockholder meeting. 

On April 1, 2016, Barton Hollow, together with the
newly elected director of the Company, caused the Company to enter into a Letter of Intent to merge with Cache Cabinetry, LLC, an Arizona
limited liability company. Cache Cabinetry was a cabinet and design company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona that focused on the design
and supply of kitchen furnishings to residential clients. Pursuant to the Letter of intent, the parties thereto would endeavor to arrive
at, and enter a definitive merger agreement providing for the Merger. As an inducement to the members of Cache Cabinetry, LLC. to enter
into the Letter of Intent and thereafter transact, the Company caused 360,000,000 shares of its common stock to be issued to the members. 

Subsequently, on Apri1 6, 2016, the Company and Cache
Cabinetry, LLC entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ). As a result, the stockholders
of the Company elected Derrick McWilliams the President and Chief Executive Officer of Cache Cabinetry, LLC, who, along with Barton Hollow,
ratified and approved the Merger Agreement and Merger 

The Merger closed on June 3, 2016. Upon closing, Cache
Cabinetry, LLC. merged into a newly created subsidiary of the Company with the members of Cache Cabinetry, LLC receiving shares of common
stock of the Company as consideration. Therefore upon closing of the Merger, Cache Cabinetry, LLC. was the surviving corporation in the
merger and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our securities involves a high degree
of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, prospective investors should carefully consider
the following risks before investing in our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, as well as other risks not currently
known to us or that we currently consider immaterial, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment in
our common stock. 

Risk Related to Covid 19 

Our business and future operations may be adversely
affected by epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak. 

We may face risks related to health epidemics
and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect
general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of the world as a whole. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19, which
originated in China, was declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, and spread across the globe. A health
epidemic or pandemic or other outbreak of communicable diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that we, or our
current and potential business partners may be disrupted or prevented from conducting business activities for certain periods of time,
the durations of which are uncertain, and may otherwise experience significant impairments of business activities, including due to operational
shutdowns or suspensions that may be requested or mandated by national or local governmental authorities or self-imposed by us, our users
or other business partners. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 could have on our business,
potential users, or other potential business partners, the continued spread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the local and federal government,
actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of the pandemic on various business activities could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. COVID-19 has not recently had any material impact on our operations, supply chain, liquidity
or capital resources. During the lockdowns we however saw significant shipping delays, consumer orders on hold due to budgetary restrictions
as well as a slow-down in our planned acquisitions due to flight restrictions limiting on site due diligence. The
company has as a mitigant to future COVID-19 outbreaks increased its number of suppliers of raw materials to reduce the risk of production
capabilities and order back-logs. 

Risks Relating to Macro Conditions and
Our Financial Condition 

Our ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to
service our debt obligations and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends
on many factors, many of which may be beyond our control. 

Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance
our obligations under, our debt, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to prevailing
economic and competitive conditions and to the financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure
you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated business opportunities will be realized
on schedule or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness
and any amounts borrowed under future credit facilities, or to fund our other liquidity needs. 

30 

 Table of Contents 

We will use cash to pay the principal and interest
on our debt. These payments limit funds otherwise available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, collaborations and
other purposes. As a result of these obligations, our current liabilities may exceed our current assets. We may need to take on additional
debt as we expand in our industry, which could increase our ratio of debt to equity. The need to service our debt may limit funds available
for other purposes and our inability to service debt in the future could lead to acceleration of our debt and foreclosure on assets. 

Although this is presently not the case, nor do we
currently foresee it, we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing as well
as prevailing market conditions. As a result, we could face liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or
operations to meet our indebtedness service and other obligations. 

The lending documents restrict, and any agreements
governing future indebtedness may restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot
assure we will be able to consummate any asset sales, or if we do, what the timing of the sales will be or whether the proceeds that we
realize will be adequate to meet indebtedness service obligations when due. 

If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate
acquisitions, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Acquisitions have been and will continue to be a significant
component of our growth strategy. We seek to identify and complete acquisitions and may continue to make strategic acquisitions. Our previous
or future acquisitions may not be successful or may not generate the financial benefits that we expected to achieve at the time of acquisition.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates in the future or acquire them on
acceptable terms or, because of competition in the marketplace and limitations imposed by the agreements governing our indebtedness or
the availability of capital, that we will be able to finance future acquisitions. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without
limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel
of the acquired businesses, disruption of our existing business, dissipation of our limited management resources and impairment of relationships
with employees and customers of the acquired business as a result of changes in ownership. While we believe that strategic acquisitions
can improve our competitiveness and profitability, these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and operating results. We may incur significant costs such as transaction fees, professional service fees and other costs related to future
acquisitions. We may also incur integration costs following the completion of any such acquisitions as we integrate the acquired business
with the rest of our Company. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of any acquired businesses
will offset the incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net financial benefit may not be achieved in the
near term, or at all. 

Inability to Continue Developing New Products. 

Our ability to continue to grow organically is tied
in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products. A failure to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative, and competitive
products to the market could limit sales growth and negatively impact our Company and our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flow. 

Risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts,
and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders on climate change issues, could negatively
affect our business and operations. 

The effects of climate change create short and long-term
financial risks to our business, both in the U.S. and globally. We have significant operations located in regions that have been, and
may in the future be, exposed to significant weather events and other natural disasters. Climate related changes can increase variability
in or otherwise impact natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the potential for increased frequency and severity of significant
weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes, and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature
and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, and/or poor water quality). We expect
climate change could affect our facilities, operations, employees, and communities in the future, particularly at facilities in coastal
areas and areas prone to extreme weather events and water scarcity. Our suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect
their ability to deliver or perform under our contracts, including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical infrastructure.
Disruptions also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating
costs.

Increased worldwide focus on climate change has led
to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse
gas emissions. New or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change related concerns
may adversely affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Some of our facilities are, for example, engaged in manufacturing processes
that produce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, or rely on products from others that do so. We have worked for years
to reduce our reliance on fossil-based energy sources, to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce our consumption of water and
production of waste, and to ensure our compliance with environmental regulations where we operate, enhancing our record of environmental
sustainability. However, new, and evolving laws and regulations could mandate different or more restrictive standards, could require capital
investments to transition to low carbon technologies, could adversely impact our ongoing operations, and could require changes on a more
accelerated time frame. Our suppliers may face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These
direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results 

We may be adversely affected by the effects
of inflation. 

Inflation in wages, materials, parts, equipment, and
other costs has the potential to adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position by increasing our overall
cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge our customers for our products
and services. In addition, the existence of inflation in the economy has the potential to result in higher interest rates, which could
result in higher borrowing costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. The
Company has currently experienced inflationary pressures on its supply chain due to increased shipping
costs, increased energy prices for manufacture of our commercial products as well as increased prices from suppliers
of raw materials. We have so far been able to offset inflationary pressure to consumers, but it cannot be guaranteed that that
our results of operations will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future and could reduce sales and/or operating margins, and
overall financial performance. 

We are Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and
Components Used in our Products. 

While the Company manufactures certain parts and components
used in its products, the Company also requires substantial amounts of raw materials and purchases certain parts and components from suppliers.
The availability of and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things,
suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, including due to geopolitical or civil unrest,
unfavorable economic or industry conditions, labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters,
the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of,
or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect the Company and its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flow. 

Using the recent example of our acquisition, Bull Head
Products Inc., the demand for new trucks has not declined during Covid-19, but instead there was a delay in the delivery of new Pickup
trucks due to a shortage of electronic chips. Historically, 68 of the truck beds built by Bull Head Products are for installation of
a truck bed on a new pickup truck. There has not been a significant shift to installation on older trucks, but instead, the customers
wait for confirmation of the delivery of new trucks before ordering a new truck bed. Bull Head Products Inc. also has order backlogs of
over 9 months due to customers waiting for their new trucks to be delivered. One-third of our current enquiries are impacted by a delay
in delivery of new pick-up trucks, which presents a risk to Bull Head Products Inc. 

Increases in the price of commodities could impact the cost or price
of our products, which could impact our ability to sustain and grow earnings. 

Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts
of raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand factors, as well as other factors beyond our control.
Raw material price fluctuations may adversely affect our results. We purchase, directly and indirectly through component purchases, significant
amounts of plastic, aluminum, steel, and other raw materials. In the past raw material prices have experienced volatility which has been
unforeseen and unexpected. Commodity pricing has fluctuated over the past few years and may continue to do so in the future. Such fluctuations
could have a material effect on our results of operations, balance sheets and cash flows and impact the comparability of our results between
financial periods.

We May be Subject to Loss in Market Share and Market Acceptance as
a Result of Performance Failures, Manufacturing Errors, Delays or Shortages. 

There is a risk that for unforeseen reasons we may
be required to repair or replace products in use or to reimburse customers for products that fail to work or meet strict performance criteria.
To date, we have experienced some product failures related to electronic and mechanical components within equipment and vehicles. These
are either repaired under warranty or at cost to the customer or under a maintenance agreement. 

Other disruptions in the supply
chain process or product sales and fulfilment systems for any reason, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols
and procedures, supplier facility shut-downs, defective raw materials, wars and conflict, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes
or wildfires, property damage from riots, and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics, such as Covid-19,
and actions by businesses, communities and governments in response, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs,
lost revenues and damage to our reputation. 

We have taken steps to limit remedies for product failure
to the repair or replacement of malfunctioning or non-compliant products or services, and also attempt to exclude or minimize exposure
to product and related liabilities by including in our standard agreements warranty disclaimers and disclaimers for consequential and
related damages as well as limitations on our aggregate liability. From time to time, in certain sales transactions, we may negotiate
liability provisions that vary from such standard forms. There is a risk that our contractual provisions may not adequately minimize our
product and related liabilities or that such provisions may be unenforceable. We intend to carry product liability insurance, but coverage
we secure may not be adequate to cover potential claims. Moreover, to the extent we have to repair, reimburse, or expend funds to cover
customer service issues, our results of operations will be negatively affected. 

We Will Rely in Part Upon Sales Reps, Retailers and Distribution
Partners to Distribute our Products, and We May Be Adversely Affected if Those Parties do not Actively Promote our Products or Pursue
Customers Who Would Have a Potential Demand for our Products. 

We estimate that a significant portion of our revenue
will come from sales to partners through sales reps, retailers, distributors, and resellers. Some of these relationships have not been
formalized in detailed contracts and may be subject to termination at any time. Even where these relationships are formalized in a detailed
contract, the agreements are often terminable with little or no notice and subject to periodic amendment. We cannot control the amount
and timing of resources that our partners devote to activities on our behalf. 

We intend to continue to seek strategic relationships
to distribute, license and sell certain of our products. We, however, may not be able to negotiate acceptable relationships in the future
and cannot predict whether current or future relationships will be successful. 

The Markets the Company operates in are Highly Competitive which
Could Reduce Sales and Operating Margins. 

Most of the Company s products are sold in competitive
markets. Maintaining and improving a competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards,
marketing, customer service and support and distribution networks. The Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position.
The Company s competitors may develop products and methods that are more efficient or may adapt quicker to new technologies or evolving
customer requirements. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or with new competitors. Pricing
pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of products to stay competitive. Failure to continue competing successfully could
reduce sales, operating margins, and overall financial performance.

The Company s Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected
by Information Systems Interruptions or Cybersecurity Intrusions. 

The Company depends on various information technologies
to administer, store, and support multiple business activities. If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject
to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, the Company could
experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on operations or the ability to provide products and services
to its customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches,
other manipulation or improper use of the Company s systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business
or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to the Company s reputation. While the Company attempts to mitigate these
risks by employing a number of measures, including having hired an IT manager with cyber security expertise, who reports directly to our
management team, employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the Company s
systems, networks, products, and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition or results of operations. Further, given the unpredictability, nature, and scope
of cyber-security attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. We have currently
not been subject to material cybersecurity breaches in our supply chain, software, or services used in our products, services, or business.
A severe future cybersecurity incident in our supply chain could however reduce sales, operating margins, and overall financial performance. 

With the strategy establishing and expanding
our defense subsidiary, which may become involved in defense contracting, we may face increased cyber and security threats that can range
from attacks common to most industries, but could have even greater financial or reputational impact, to advanced persistent threats on
our defense programs, which could involve information that is considered a matter of national security. 

Our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to operate
and expand internationally, and our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations. 

Currently, we maintain operations in the United States,
the United Kingdom, the Republic of Serbia and the United Arab Emirates, and plan to continue our efforts to expand globally, in jurisdictions
where we do not currently operate including, but not limited to, Spain, Uruguay and South Africa. The Company expects international operations
and export sales to continue to constitute the majority of our sales and assets in the foreseeable future. For the year ended December
31, 2022, the international operations constituted 84.4 of our total sales of which part of the international operation include international
sales to US costumers. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive, and any international expansion efforts
that we undertake may not be profitable in the near or long term. Although we have operating experience in many foreign jurisdictions,
we must still continue to make significant investments to build our international operations. The Company s sales from international
operations and sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks
include the following: 

Costs, risks and uncertainties associated with tailoring our services in international jurisdictions as needed to better address both the needs of customers, and the threats of local competitors; 

Risks of economic instability, including due to inflation; 

Uncertainties in forecasting revenues and expenses in markets where we have not previously operated; 

Costs and risks associated with local and national laws and regulations governing the industries in which we operate, health and safety, climate change and sustainability, and labor and employment; 

Operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences; 

Costs and risks associated with compliance with international tax laws and regulations; 

Costs and risks associated with compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws in the United States related to conducting business outside the United States, as well as the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions governing bribery and other corrupt business activities; 

34 

 Table of Contents 

Costs and risks associated with human trafficking, modern slavery and forced labor reporting, training and due diligence laws and regulations in various jurisdictions; 

Being subject to other laws and regulations, including laws governing online advertising and other Internet activities, email and other messaging, collection and use of personal information, ownership of intellectual property, taxation and other activities important to our online business practices; 

Currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation; 

Competition with companies that understand the local market better than we do or that have preexisting relationships with regulators and customers in those markets; 

Adverse effects resulting from the U.K. s exit from the European Union (commonly known as Brexit 

Reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

Disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances; 

Withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries; 

Changes in tariff and trade barriers; and 

geopolitical events, including natural disasters, climate change, public health issues, political instability (such as war between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection, or war. 

Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities
now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign
government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability
to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. 

Operating in international markets also requires significant
management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth
in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability and could instead result in increased costs without a corresponding
benefit. We cannot guarantee that our international operations or expansion efforts will be successful. 

Any of these events as well as related events not aforementioned,
could have a materially adverse impact on the Company and its operations. 

Uncertainty Related to Environmental Regulation and Industry Standards,
as well as Physical Risks of Climate Change, Could Impact the Company s Results of Operations and Financial Position. 

Increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental
risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to
reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. New climate change laws and regulations could require the Company to
change its manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for its manufacturing operations.
Various jurisdictions in which the Company does business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on
emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, the production of single use plastics,
regulations on energy management and waste management and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase the Company s
expenses and adversely affect its operating results. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and
cost of materials, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs.
The expected future increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change could expand the nature, scope, and complexity
of matters that the Company is required to control, assess, and report. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are
either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its suppliers,
its customers or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change on the Company, its
customers or its suppliers, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

Significant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm
the Company s Financial Results. 

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, British Pound, Indian Rupee, UAE Dirham and Serbian Dinar. Any significant change
in the value of the currencies of the countries in which the Company does business against the U.S. Dollar could affect the Company s
ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 

A Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices Including
Oil Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of the Company s Customers. 

Demand for the Company s products depends, in
part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of its customers. The level of expenditures by the Company s customers
is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective
industries and expectations of future market behavior. The Company s profitability may be adversely affected during any periods
of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates and volatility in commodity prices, including
oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and especially impact our Industrial
 Manufacturing division and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing
orders. The ability of the Company s customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions
in their industries. Reduced demand for the Company s products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead
to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have
a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations. 

We are dependent on financing for the continuation
of our operations. 

It can at times be difficult to predict our capital
needs on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain profitable operations or financing.
We reserve the right to seek additional funds through private placements of our common stock and/or through debt financing. We do not
have financing in place at this time for all future planned acquisitions. We may not have access to financing or on terms that are acceptable
to us. Any lack of funds from operations or fundraisings for any shortage could be detrimental to our ability to continue operations and
negatively impact us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 

Risks Related to Legal, Accounting and Regulatory
Matters 

An Unfavorable Outcome of Any Pending Contingencies or Litigation
Could Adversely Affect the Company. 

We have been named as a defendant in a lawsuit, and
we may be named in additional litigation, all of which will require significant management time and attention and result in significant
legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by our former CEO, Larson Elmore. A case also has been filed in the Eight Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (Case No. A-22-858343-C).
Plaintiff alleges that we breached a stock purchase agreement dated May 10, 2020, and promissory notes and is therefore entitled to damages.
We have potential counterclaims against the former CEO which are being prepared due to improper action and lack of disclosures. The
company has disputed the claim and argue that Larson Elmore has been misleading the company and its shareholders on various matters including
but not limited to liabilities, company commitments and due diligence items presented by Larson Elmore during the takeover process. We
are in the process of a settlement discussion and have obtained an extension of time to respond while this process occurs. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by Steve Nicol, who claims that he loaned 12,000 on or about May 23, 2017, to Cache Cabinetry, LLC a subsidiary of ILUS under a promissory
note, but that ILUS agreed to assume the note. He further claims that he elected to convert the note and that ILUS failed to convert the
note into shares of ILUS common stock. He has alleged breach of contract, declaratory relief, and specific performance to require the
company to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock in ILUS. 

36 

 Table of Contents 

We cannot predict whether the action against involving
our former CEO or Mr. Nicol is likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to our company. In general, we lack much information
and evidence to support the assertions of financial statements prior to the current management taking over and there are chances that
preceding management of the company might have missed compliances for which we are not aware. Thus, the company may have to bear consequences
for that from authorities. We cannot reasonably ascertain an amount for those contingencies. 

Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the Company
accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results
and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be
affected by changes in assumption. 

We may continue to incur legal fees in responding to
these and other lawsuits. The expense of defending such litigation may be significant and any sizeable verdict may adversely affect the
company. The amount of time to resolve this and any additional lawsuits is unpredictable, and these actions may divert management s
attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
cash flows. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 8, Legal Proceedings . 

The Sale of our Products Involves Potential Product Liability and Related Risks that Could Expose us to Significant Insurance and Loss
Expenses. 

We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability
claims if the use of our products results in, or is believed to have resulted in, illness or injury. Any product liability claim may increase
our costs and adversely affect our revenue and operating income. Moreover, liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase
our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles for our insurances we have with Firebug Group, Georgia Fire and Bull Head
Products and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. In addition, our product liability insurance
may fail to cover future product liability claims, which, if adversely determined, could subject us to substantial monetary damages. Georgia
Fire, Bull Head Products and Firebug all have General Liability Cover. 

Failure by us to Maintain the Proprietary Nature of our Technology,
Intellectual Property and Manufacturing Processes Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business, Operating Results, Financial Condition,
Stock Price, and on our Ability to Compete Effectively. 

We principally rely upon patent, trademark, copyright,
trade secret and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights. There is a risk that claims allowed on any patent licenses
or trademarks we hold may not be broad enough to protect our technology. In addition, our patent licenses or trademarks may be challenged,
invalidated, or circumvented and we cannot be certain that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. Moreover,
any current or future issued or licensed patents, or trademarks, or currently existing or future developed trade secrets or know-how may
not afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technologies or processes, and the possibility exists that certain of
our already issued patents or trademarks may infringe upon third party patents or trademarks or be designed around by others. In addition,
there is a risk that others may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes, which are the same as, substantially equivalent,
or superior to ours, or become available in the market at a lower price. 

In addition, foreign laws treat the protection of proprietary
rights differently from laws in the United States and may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. The failure
of foreign laws or judicial systems to adequately protect our proprietary rights or intellectual property, including intellectual property
developed on our behalf by foreign contractors or subcontractors may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial
results, and stock price. 

There is a risk that we have infringed or in the future
will infringe patents or trademarks owned by others, that we will need to acquire licenses under patents or trademarks belonging to others
for technology potentially useful or necessary to us, and that licenses will not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. 

We may have to litigate to enforce our patents or trademarks
or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights. Litigation could be very costly and divert management s
attention. An adverse outcome in any litigation may have a severe negative effect on our financial results and stock price. To determine
the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or oppositions in foreign patent and trademark offices, which could result in substantial cost and limitations on the scope or
validity of our patents or trademarks. 

We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how,
which we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers and third parties. There is
a risk that these agreements may be breached, and that the remedies available to us may not be adequate. In addition, our trade secrets
and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known to or be independently discovered by others.

Compliance with Changing Regulation of Corporate Governance and Public
Disclosure May Result in Additional Expenses. 

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to
corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new SEC regulations, are creating uncertainty
for companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases
due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory
and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing
revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure.
As a result, we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in
increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance
activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory
or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed. 

If we Fail to Comply with the Rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Related to Accounting Controls and Procedures, or if Material Weaknesses or Other Deficiencies are Discovered in our Internal Accounting
Procedures, our Stock Price Could Decline Significantly. 

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual
management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors
addressing these assessments. We are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, and we may identify material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and other deficiencies. If material weaknesses and deficiencies are detected,
it could cause investors to lose confidence in our Company and result in a decline in our stock price and consequently affect our financial
condition. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we
can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to
produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports
or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information,
and the trading price of our Common Stock could drop significantly. In addition, we cannot be certain that additional material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future. 

Failure To Comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the
U.K. Bribery Act or Other Applicable Anti-bribery Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company. 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery
Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity
with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased
enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.
The Company s policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, the Company operates in certain countries that are
recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. The Company s internal control policies and procedures may not always
protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws
may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results
of operations.

Changes in Tax laws or Exposure to Additional Income Tax Liabilities
Could have a Material Impact on our Company, the Results of Operations, Financial Conditions and Cash Flows. 

We are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income-based
taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as jurisdictions such as the United States, in which we intend to have operations.
The tax laws in these could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us and our effective
tax rate. 

Taxation regulation in territories around the world
can also change very quickly, which may mean that all the implications for businesses may not have been fully thought through by the regulating
authorities before final guidelines and laws are issued. Furthermore, any changes made by tax authorities, together with other legislative
changes, to the mandatory sharing of company information (financial and operational) with tax authorities on both a local and global basis,
could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions with respect to the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions. We therefore
continuously monitor changes to tax regulation and double tax treaties between the territories in which we operate. We also maintain a
comprehensive transfer pricing policy to govern the flow of funds between various tax territories. 

We are further subject to ongoing tax audits in the
various jurisdictions in which we operate. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness
of our tax provisions. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, which could have
a material impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

While we have recorded reserves for potential payments
to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex
tax regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in payment that is significantly different
from our estimates. If the payment proves to be less than the recorded reserves, the reversal of the liabilities would generally result
in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities to be no longer necessary. Conversely, if the payment
proves to be more than the reserves, we could incur additional charges, and these could have a materially adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Laws and Regulations Governing International Business Operations
Could Adversely Impact Our Company. 

The US Department of the Treasury s Office of
Foreign Assets Control OFAC ), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the US Department of Commerce BIS administer certain laws and regulations that restrict US persons and, in some instances, non-US persons, in conducting activities, transacting
business with, or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to US economic sanctions. 

Our international operations subject us to these laws
and regulations, which are complex, restrict business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are
constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced, or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.
From time to time, certain subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. 

Certain of our subsidiaries sell products, and may
provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant
amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations
of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment
from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. 

We have established policies and procedures
designed to assist with compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these will prevent us from
violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage. As such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to changes in contract
estimates in our Defense and Industrial Manufacturing Divisions 

 We account for substantially all long-term
contracts in the Defense and Industrial Manufacturing Divisions utilizing the cost-to-cost method of percentage-of-completion accounting.
This accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs, and making assumptions regarding the timing
of receipt of delivery orders from our customer and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of these contracts, the estimation of
total revenues and costs is complicated and subject to many variables. We must make assumptions regarding for example expected increases
in material costs, wages and employee benefits, engineering hours, productivity and availability of labor and allocated fixed costs. Changes
to production costs, overhead rates, learning curves and/or supplier performance can also impact these estimates. Furthermore, under the
revenue recognition accounting rules, we can only include units in our estimates of overall contract profitability after we have received
a firm delivery order for those units. Because new orders have the potential to significantly change the overall profitability of cumulative
orders received to date, particularly early in the contract when fewer overall units are on order, the period in which we receive those
orders will impact the estimated life-to-date contract profitability. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could
have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial condition and/or profitability. 

 General Risk Factors 

The Company s Success Depends on Its Executive Management and
Other Key Personnel. 

The Company s future success depends to a significant
degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company
with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of the executive officers or a failure to provide adequate
succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited
and the competition for talent is robust. However, the Company provides long-term equity awards and certain other benefits for its executive
officers which provides incentives for them to make a commitment to the Company. The Company s future success will depend on its
ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace
executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse
effect on the Company s operations and implementation of its strategic plan. 

Challenges with Respect to Labor Availability Could Negatively Impact
the Company s Ability to Operate or Grow the Business. 

The Company s success depends in part on the
ability of its businesses to proactively attract, motivate, and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive
labor market. A failure to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company s operating
results or its ability to operate or grow the business. Additionally, any labor stoppages or labor disruptions, including due to geopolitical
unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious
disease or illness could adversely affect the Company s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business. 

Risks Related to our Management and Control Persons 

Our largest shareholder, officer, director,
Nicolas Link holds substantial control over the company and is able to influence all corporate matters, which could be deemed by shareholders
as not always being in their best interests. 

Nicolas Link, our Chief Executive
Officer (Principal Executive Officer Chairman of the Board of Directors) with his company, FB Technologies Global, Inc. Dubai, U.A.E
, owns approximately 2 of the outstanding shares of common stock, owns all of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock, Class
B Preferred Stock and Class D Preferred Stock and owns 15 of the outstanding shares of Class F Preferred Stock. 

Our common stock is entitled to
one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Each share of Class A
Preferred Stock is entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to shareholders at a rate of
500 votes, including the election of directors. Each share of Class D Preferred Stock is entitled to vote together with the holders of
our common stock on all matters submitted to shareholders at a rate of 500 votes, including the election of directors. 

40 

 Table of Contents 

There are 1,379,080,699 shares
of common stock outstanding, which amounts to 1,379,080,699 votes on matters requiring a shareholder vote. While Mr. Link owns only 2 
of the outstanding common shares, with the Series A Preferred Stock that Mr. Link owns, he has the power over 5,000,000,000 votes and
with the Series D Preferred Stock, he has the power to over 30,370,500,000 additional votes on matters requiring a shareholder vote, including
the election of directors. He will have voting power over every aspect of our business. 

By virtue of his ownership of
common stock and preferred stock, Mr. Link is able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders,
including the election of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, and any change of control of our company. 

Our officers and directors are located outside
of the U.S., so it will be difficult to effect service of process and enforcement of legal judgments upon our officers and directors. 

Our officers and directors are
located outside of the United States and reside in the U.A.E, U.K., and Denmark. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of
process within the United States and enforce judgments of the US courts obtained against our executive officers and directors. Particularly,
our shareholders may not be able to: 

Effect service of process
in the U.S. on any of our officers and directors; 

Enforce judgments obtained
in U.S. courts against our officers and directors based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; 

Enforce, in a court
outside of the U.S., judgments of U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; and 

Bring an original action in a court in the U.A.E, U.K., or Denmark
to enforce liabilities against any of our officers and directors based upon the U.S. federal securities laws. 

We are dependent on the continued services of
our Director and Chairman and if we fail to keep them or fail to attract and retain qualified senior executives and key technical personnel,
our business may not be able to expand. 

We are dependent on the continued
availability of Chairman, Nicolas Link and Director, John-Paul Backwell, and the availability of new executives to implement our business
plans. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in our industry. Although we expect that our planned
compensation programs will be intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to retain all our key employees or a sufficient number to execute our plans, nor can there be any assurance we will
be able to continue to attract new employees as required. 

Our lack of adequate D O insurance may also
make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers. 

In the future we may be subject to litigation, including
potential class action and stockholder derivative actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify,
and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. To date, we have not obtained directors and officers
liability D O insurance, but the company is currently investigating and plans to obtain one. Without adequate D O
insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service
to the Company could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, our
lack of adequate D O insurance may make it difficult for us to retain and attract talented and skilled directors and officers, which
could adversely affect our business. 

Our Officers and Key Personnel may voluntarily
terminate their relationship with us at any time, and competition for qualified personnel is lengthy, costly, and disruptive. 

If we lose the services of our
officers and key personnel and fail to replace them if they depart, we could experience a negative effect on our financial results and
stock price. The loss and our failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional key employees could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating and financial results and stock price.

Risks Relating to our Common Stock 

We may conduct offerings of our equity securities
in the future, in which case your proportionate interest may become diluted. 

We may be required to conduct
equity offerings in the future to finance our current projects or to finance subsequent projects that we decide to undertake. If our common
stock shares are issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current shareholders
but with the aim to increase overall value for all shareholders. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock
shares in order to fund our business operations. If we issue additional common stock shares or securities convertible into shares of our
common stock, your percentage interest in us could become diluted. 

Our common stock price may be volatile and could
fluctuate, which could result in substantial losses for investors. 

Our common stock is quoted on
the OTC Pink Market under the symbol, ILUS. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate
in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

government regulation of our Company and operations. 

the establishment of partnerships. 

intellectual property disputes. 

additions or departures of key personnel. 

sales of our common stock. 

our ability to integrate operations, technology, products, and services. 

our ability to execute our business plan. 

operating results below expectations. 

loss of any strategic relationship. 

industry developments. 

economic and other external factors; and 

period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. 

In addition, the securities markets
have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular
companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

42 

 Table of Contents 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our
common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to fall. 

The market price of our common stock could decline
significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock. If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an
intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the contractual and securities law restrictions
on resale of such common stock lapse, or after those shares become registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement,
the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of March 31, 2023, a total of 1,379,080,699 shares of our common stock were outstanding.
Of those shares, 1,190,797,366 are currently without restriction, in the public market. Upon
the effectiveness of any registration statement, we could elect to file with respect to any outstanding shares of common stock, any sales
of those shares or any perception in the market that such sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 

The issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion or exercise
of preferred stock, warrants and convertible notes, will dilute ownership to existing shareholders and may cause our stock price to fall. 

Any issuance of additional common stock by us in the
future as a result of the conversion or exercise of warrants, convertible notes, preferred stock, or debt settlements would result in
dilution to our existing shareholders. Such issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current
trading price of our common stock. Moreover, the perception in the public market that shareholders might sell shares of our stock or that
we could make a significant issuance of additional common stock in the future could depress the market for our shares. These sales, or
the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, or make it more difficult for us to sell
equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 

We have issued shares of our common stock, as well
as other securities such as warrants, convertible notes, preferred stock, or debt settlements, which are convertible into shares of our
common stock, in financing transactions that are deemed to be restricted securities, as that term is defined in Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act. From time to time, certain of our shareholders or derivative security holders may be eligible to
sell all or some of their restricted shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to
Rule 144, subject to certain limitations. The resale pursuant to Rule 144 of shares acquired from us in private transactions could cause
our stock price to decline significantly. 

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends
or distributions on our capital stock. 

We have never declared or paid
any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. While we may not anticipate paying a dividend in the short-term and we currently
intend to retain short-term earnings for growth, we may do so in the medium to long-term future. 

The declaration, payment and amount
of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results
of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors
considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect
to the amount of any such dividend. 

We may become involved in securities class action
litigation that could divert management s attention and harm our business. 

The stock market in general, have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies
involved. If these fluctuations occur in the future, the market price of our shares could fall regardless of our operating performance.
In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities, securities class action litigation
has often been brought against that company. If the market price or volume of our shares suffers extreme fluctuations, then we may become
involved in this type of litigation, which would be expensive and divert management s attention and resources from managing our
business. 

As a public company, we may also from time to time
make forward-looking statements about future operating results and provide some financial guidance to the public markets. Projections
may not be timely made and set at expected performance levels and could affect the price of our shares.

Our common stock is currently deemed a penny stock, 
which makes it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares. 

Our common stock is currently deemed a penny
stock, which makes it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares. The SEC has adopted rule 3a51-1 which establishes
the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving
a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15g-9 requires: 

that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, and 

the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. 

In order to approve a person s account for transactions
in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: 

obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person, and 

make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 

The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any
transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: 

sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and 

that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. 

Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions
in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock
and cause a decline in the market value of our stock. 

Risks Relating to Our Company and Industry 

The success of our business depends on our ability to maintain and
enhance our reputation and brand. 

We believe that our reputation in our industry is of
significant importance to the success of our business. A well-recognized brand is critical to increasing our customer base and, in turn,
increasing our revenue. Since the industry is highly competitive, our ability to remain competitive depends to a large extent on our ability
to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand, which could be difficult and expensive. To maintain and enhance our reputation and brand,
we need to successfully manage many aspects of our business, such as cost-effective marketing campaigns to increase brand recognition
and awareness in a highly competitive market. We cannot assure you, however, that these activities will be successful and achieve the
brand promotion goals we expect. If we fail to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in our
efforts to do so, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

In the event that we are unable to successfully compete in our industry,
we may not see lower profit margins 

We face substantial competition in our industry. Due
to our smaller size, it can be assumed that some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other competitive resources.
Accordingly, these competitors may have already begun to establish superior technologies in our industry. We will attempt to compete against
these competitors by developing technology that exceed what is offered by our competitors. However, we cannot assure you that our technology
will outperform competing technology, or that our competitors will not develop new products or services that exceed what we provide. In
addition, we may face competition based on price. If our competitors lower the prices on their products, then it may not be possible for
us to market our products at prices that are economically viable. Increased competition could result in: 

Lower than projected revenues; 

Price reductions and lower profit margins. 

Any one of these results could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

44 

 Table of Contents 

In addition, our competitors may develop competing products that
achieve greater market acceptance. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. Our inability
to achieve sales and revenue due to competition will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If we are unable to successfully manage growth, our operations could
be adversely affected. 

Our progress is expected to require the full utilization
of our management, financial and other resources. Our ability to manage growth effectively will depend on our ability to improve and expand
operations, including our financial and management information systems, and to recruit, train and manage personnel. There can be no absolute
assurance that management will be able to manage growth effectively. 

If we do not properly manage the growth of our business,
we may experience significant strains on our management and operations and disruptions in our business. Various risks arise when companies
and industries grow quickly. If our business or industry grows too quickly, our ability to meet customer demand in a timely and efficient
manner could be challenged. We may also experience development delays as we seek to meet increased demand for our services and platform.
Our failure to properly manage the growth that we or our industry might experience could negatively impact our ability to execute on our
operating plan and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on our business, our cash flow and results of operations, and our reputation
with our current or potential customers. 

We may fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or otherwise be
unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions . 

We believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow
through acquisitions and joint ventures across all service categories and we expect to continue a strategy of selectively identifying
and acquiring businesses with complementary services. We may be unable to identify, negotiate, and complete suitable acquisition opportunities
on reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that any business acquired by us will be successfully integrated with our operations or
prove to be profitable to us. We may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions. Should any of the following problems, or others,
occur as a result of our acquisition strategy, the impact could be material: 

difficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business; difficulties integrating information systems; 

the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies; 

the assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unknown liabilities of acquired companies; or the diversion of management attention from existing operations. 

The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers
and employees under our Articles of Incorporation and the existence of indemnification rights to our directors, officers and employees
may result in substantial expenditures by our Company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, and employees. 

Our Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that
eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our Company and shareholders. Our bylaws also require us to indemnify
our officers and directors. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors, officers,
and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost
of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers, and employees that we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resulting
costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers, and employees for breaches of their fiduciary
duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors, officers, and employees
even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our Company and shareholders.

 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits,
claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Aside from the below, we are not currently a party,
as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be
expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us. 

Ilustrato Pictures International Inc has applied to
the District Court, Clark County, Nevada to have 40,000,000 shares with Ambrose Keith cancelled as they were issued in error in
2018 as the deal never completed. The case has been won on September 15, 2022, in favor of the company and the court order was received
on January 23, 2023. The transfer agent cancelled the 40,000,000 shares on February 17, 2023. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by our former CEO, Larson Elmore. A case has been filed in the Eight Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (Case No. A-22-858343-C).
Plaintiff alleges that we breached a stock purchase agreement dated May 10, 2020, and promissory notes and is therefore entitled to damages.
We have potential counterclaims being prepared against the former CEO, arising due to improper action and lack of disclosures. The
company has disputed the claim and argue that Larson Elmore has been misleading the company and its shareholders on various matters including
but not limited to liabilities, company commitments and due diligence items presented by Larson Elmore during the takeover process. We
are in the process of a settlement discussion and have obtained an extension of time to respond while this process occurs. 

We have been named as a defendant in an action commenced
by Steve Nicol, who claims that he loaned 12,000 to a subsidiary of ILUS under a promissory note, but that ILUS agreed to assume the
note. He further claims that he elected to convert the note and that ILUS failed to convert the note into shares of ILUS common stock.
He has alleged breach of contract, declaratory relief, and specific performance to require the company to issue 75,000,000 shares of common
stock in ILUS. 

We cannot predict whether this action involving our former CEO
or Mr. Nicol is likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to our company. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the
Company accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates based upon an analysis of potential
results and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period
could be affected by changes in assumption. 

We
may continue to incur legal fees in responding to this and other lawsuits. The expense of defending such litigation may be significant
and any sizeable verdict may adversely affect the company. The amount of time to resolve this and any additional lawsuits is unpredictable,
and these actions may divert management s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, all of which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and cash flows .

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

ILUS is a Nevada Corporation primarily focused on the
public safety, industrial and renewable energy sectors. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Emergency Response Technologies Inc. ERT ),
ILUS aims to provide technology that protects communities, front line personnel and assets by acquiring technology and solutions for the
emergency response sector. This sector includes Fire and Rescue Services, Law Enforcement, Emergency Medical Services and Emergency Management.
The company also has an Industrial and Manufacturing subsidiary, Quality Industrial Corp., which is focused on the acquisition and growth
of process manufacturing and industrial companies. Furthermore, the company has a Mining and Renewable Energy subsidiary which is focused
on the incorporation, acquisition, and growth of companies in the sustainable mining and renewable energy sectors. 

ILUS has four distinct divisions which together serve
a diverse global customer base. An overview of the current divisions is found below: 

Emergency Response division: 

Emergency Response Technologies is a subsidiary of
ILUS, whose operating companies design, manufacture and distribute specialty equipment, vehicles and related parts and services. We provide
firefighting equipment, firefighting vehicles, firefighting vehicle superstructures, distribution of equipment for emergency services,
fire protection equipment sales, installation, and maintenance as well as servicing/maintenance of Firefighting, Rescue and Emergency
Medical Services equipment. 

Industrial Manufacturing division: 

This division is specialized in the manufacturing
and assembling of process equipment, piping, and modules for the oil, gas, and energy sectors with over two decades of experience and
key end-users in the Oil Gas, Off-shore, Refineries Petrochemical, Waste-water trea tment plants
and Chemical, Fertilizer, Metals Mineral Processing industries. The international end-users include such as, but not limited to
Chevron, BP, Shell, Total, Sasol, Gasco. The sub-division has capabilities of undertaking design, detailed engineering, procurement,
fabrication, site erection, commissioning, testing handing over of process equipment. The funding obligations for acquisitions
such as Quality International Co Ltd FCZ and Petro Line FZ LLC, by our publicly listed industrial subsidiary, Quality Industrial Corp.
(OTC: QIND), are currently funded by QIND itself as are the ongoing obligations for future acquisitions by the subsidiary. 

Mining Renewable Energy division: 

This division is engaged in the Mining Renewable
Energy industry currently through its subsidiary Replay Solutions with recycling and recovery of precious metals from electronic waste.
We incorporate a Closed loop concept where we use E Waste and data destruction as a resource not only to extract
precious metals but to reuse all materials found in E-Waste such as plastics. We recycle cleanly, safely, and sustainably on items such
as, but not limited to Print Circuit Boards (PCB) and precious metals, Cable wire, car radiator shredding and separation. We shred, crush,
and grind the board to powder form and then use an airflow and an electrostatic separator to separate the materials into metal and fibers.

Defense
Division: 

This division is engaged in
the Defense industry currently through its subsidiary Hyperion Defence Solutions where it aims
to provide customers with the technological capability, solutions and services that will protect their warfighters and provide them with
a technological advantage in the following key areas: Joint Close Air Support (JCAS), Counter Improvised
Explosive Devices (CIED), Security Risk Management, Simulation Technology and Services. 

 Factors Affecting Our Performance 

The primary factors affecting
our results of operations include: 

General Macro Economic Conditions 

Our business is impacted by the global economic environment,
employment levels, consumer confidence, government, and municipal spending. Global instability in securities markets and the war in Ukraine
are among other factors that can impact our financial performance. In particular, changes in the U.S. economic climate can impact the
demand of our products range. In addition, the impact of taxes and fees can have a dramatic effect on the availability, lead-times and
costs associated with raw materials and parts for our product range. 

Our purchases are discretionary by nature and therefore
sensitive to the availability of financing, consumer confidence, and unemployment levels among other factors and are affected by general
U.S. and global economic conditions, which create risks that future economic downturns will further reduce consumer demand and negatively
impact our sales. 

While less economically sensitive than the Emergency
Response sector, the Industrial and Manufacturing sectors are also impacted by the overall economic environment. Tenders can be withdrawn
and lead times for the manufacturing can be affected which can result in cancellation of orders if not delivered on time. 

Impact of Acquisitions 

Historically, a significant component of our growth
has been through the acquisition of businesses in our targeted sectors. We typically incur upfront costs as we incorporate and integrate
acquired businesses into our operating philosophy and operational excellence. This includes the consolidation of supplies and raw materials,
optimized logistics and production processes, and other restructuring and improvements initiatives. The benefits of these integration
efforts may not positively impact our financial results in the short-term but has historically positively impacted medium to long-term
results. 

We recognize acquired assets and liabilities at fair
value. This includes the recognition of identified intangible assets and goodwill. In addition, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed
generally include tangible assets, as well as contingent assets and liabilities. 

Recent Developments and Plan of Operations 

First Half of 2022 

In the first half of 2022, ILUS planned to acquire
specific manufacturing and distribution capability in the United States as well as additional technological and strategic advancement.
ILUS therefore acquired Bull-Head Products, a Tennessee based manufacturer specialist vehicle truck beds and vehicle conversions, Georgia
Fire Rescue, Georgian based distributor of firefighting equipment, and Quality Industrial Corp. a Special Purpose Vehicle listed
on the OTCQB intended for the acquisition Quality International Co Ltd FCZ which the company signed

For the year 2021, ILUS acquired three companies,
namely Firebug Group (FB Fire Technologies Ltd and Firebug Mechanical Equipment LLC) with both companies engaged in the business of manufacturing
firefighting equipment and firefighting vehicles for global customers, and Bright Concept Detection and Protection System LLC (BCD Fire)
a company engaged in the business of sales, distribution, installation and maintenance of Fire Protection and Security systems and lastly,
The Vehicle Converters LLC, a company engaged in the conversion of specialized vehicles for specialist applications such as mobile clinics,
ambulances, defense and oil field transportation. 

 The revenue earned in the year 2021 corresponds
to the above three subsidiaries, in-house operations and the manufacturing of Firefighting Equipment. 

 Our 2022 revenue increased to 78,344,131
from 11,263,875 in 2021. The increase in revenue is primarily a result of the acquisition of Quality International by our Industrial
 Manufacturing subsidiary and the newly acquired companies in our Emergency Response subsidiary. Quality International has been consolidated
for the last three quarters of 2022 following the signed binding letter of intent for its acquisition in Q2, 2022. There were no operations
in our Industrial Manufacturing division for the year 2021. Further, 2022 financial results of Emergency Response Segment
are comprised of six subsidiaries versus three subsidiaries in the year 2021.

We believe we have made substantial progress
in our Industrial Manufacturing division (QIND) in this fiscal year. The Company will allocate financial, technical and sales resources
for our recently acquired subsidiaries with the aim to positively impact their financial results through increased sales orders and efficiency.
Allocated personnel will primarily focus on accelerating sales and marketing efforts, product development, international market expansion,
optimizing of supply chain and production processes, overall increased profitability while continuing with the integration and optimization
of current operating companies. With the group expansion and growth, we also anticipate hiring executives and personnel with specific
industry experience and fields of expertise to streamline financial reporting, compliance, Investor Relations and to improve our corporate
governance in line with an anticipated uplist to a national exchange. 

 In our Emergency Response Technologies
subsidiary, our challenge is to bring some operating companies up to the high level of performance of our top performing businesses.
We will continue to focus on improving the performance of lagging businesses through actions which include but are not limited to; targeted
and more robust sales and marketing efforts, appointment of new distributors and dealers where applicable, enhanced product development,
active measures to ensure that payment terms are met by customers, and significant efforts to reduce indirect costs as well as general
and administrative costs.

million in the fiscal year 2022 primarily due to higher gross profit in the Industrial Manufacturing division along with increase
in gross profit in the Emergency response segment. 

 The increase in gross profit in the Emergency
Response Division is primarily the result of increased efficiencies resulting from operational improvement initiatives and higher volume
leverage, favorable price/cost and productivity.

Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses
corresponding to the Emergency Response Technologies subsidiary have increased primarily due to the impact from acquisitions, resource
investments, product development, marketing, and employee-related costs. Such expenses were higher in 2022, as more companies were acquired
under this segment and a larger amount was spent towards the strengthening and growth of our companies in this segment to increase both
revenue and profitability in 2023 and 2024 as well as longer term growth. 

Other Income/ Expense 

During the year 2021, company

Net Income 

We
incurred net income for the group of 4,559,375 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net income of 13,980,477 for
the same period ended December 31, 2021. The main driver for the decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was an
increase in SG A as referenced above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

 Our primary requirements for
liquidity and capital are working capital, expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, product development and certification, new
acquisitions and existing acquisition tranche payments, debt service payments and general corporate operational needs. Historically, these
cash requirements have been met through cash provided by financing activities. 

Based on management s current expectations
and available information, the Company believes its increase in operations and cash available from Financing activities will be sufficient
to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, for the
foreseeable future. 

The Company continues to actively
monitor its liquidity position and working capital needs and prioritizes capital expenditure related to capacity and strategic investments.
The Company remains in a stable overall position regarding capital resources and liquidity, which the Company believes is adequate to
meet its projected needs. 

Additionally, if aligned businesses
are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through
the incurrence of additional borrowings. 

On December 31, 2022, working capital was
 59 million. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 2 million, of which xxx million
was held outside of the United States. 

On December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of 15.85 million
compared with a working capital of 3.82 million as of December 31, 2021. The deficit is due a loan payable of 82M for the acquisition
of Quality International.

Operating
Cash Flows 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
fiscal year 2022 was 33 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities in the year 2021 which was 13 million. The decrease
in positive cash generation from operating activities for the fiscal year 2022 is related to an increase in accounts receivable, an increase
in inventories due to supply chain, an increase in accounts payable and higher purchases of inventory, partially offset by an increase
in customer advances. 

Investing Cash Flows 

Investing activities used cash of 60 million
for acquisitions in the fiscal year 2022.The increase in net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to increased investment
primarily in acquisitions.

Going Concern 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 

Management
evaluated all relevant conditions and events that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated
financial statements are issued and determined. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s
ability to generate increased revenues and raise capital within one year from the date of filing. 

 Over the next twelve months management plans
to use borrowings and security sales to mitigate the effects of cash flow deficits; however, no assurance can be given that debt or equity
financing, if and when required, will be available. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being December 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based
upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financing Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this
annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses,
we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2023: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel
to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional
financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts
may be adversely affected in a material manner. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption
for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

of similar transactions to which we were or will be a participant in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 120,000
or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any director, executive

Director
Independence 

The
Board of Directors is currently composed of one member. Mr. Nicholas Link does not qualify as independent in accordance with the published
listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that
the Director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of the Company s employees and that neither the Director, nor
any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. 

Indemnification 

Under
our bylaws, every person who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was our director or officer, or is or was
serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust,
or other enterprise, shall be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent legally permissible under the laws of the State of Nevada
from time to time against all expenses, liability, and loss (including attorneys fees judgments, fines, and amounts paid or to
be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by him or her in connection therewith. Such right of indemnification shall be a
contract right, which may be enforced in any manner desired by such person. The expenses of officers and directors incurred in defending
a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding must be paid by us as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the
action, suit, or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not entitled to be indemnified by us. Such right of indemnification shall not
be exclusive of any other right which such directors, officers, or representatives may have or hereafter acquire, and, without limiting
the generality of such statement, they shall be entitled to their respective rights of indemnification under any bylaw, agreement, vote
of shareholders, provision of law, or otherwise. 

Without
limiting the application of the foregoing, our board of directors may adopt bylaws from time to time with respect to indemnification,
to provide at all times the fullest indemnification permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada, and may cause us to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was our director or officer, or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer
of another corporation, or as its representative in a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred in any such capacity or arising out of such status, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify
such person. The indemnification provided shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent,
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person. 

Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy
as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

All Other
Fees 

Our
independent registered public accountants did not provide any products and services not disclosed in the table above during the 2022 and
2021 fiscal years. As a result, there were no other fees billed or paid during those fiscal years.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Ilustrato Pictures International,
 Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of Ilustrato Pictures International, Inc. (the Company)( Ilus as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the related
statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the Consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 06, 2023, expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note No. 21 to the financial statements, the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business. 

Management evaluated all relevant conditions and events
that are reasonably known or reasonably knowable, in the aggregate, as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued and
determined. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to continue to generate
sufficient revenues, collect due revenues and raise capital within one year from the date of filing. 

Over the next twelve months management plans to use borrowings
and security sales to mitigate the effects of cash flow deficits; however, no assurance can be given that debt or equity financing, if
and when required, will be available. 

Ilus recorded all revenue generated
from selected customers on a credit basis. At the end of the year, accounts receivable for the previous year and the current year have
not been collected. The management has represented that they will collect the cash for all outstanding account receivables due from the
previous years and the current year. Refer No. 21 for accounts receivable in detail. 

Review of Bull Head Products Inc . and Georgia
Fire Rescue Supply LLC (Subsidiary) 

Review of Bull Head Products
Inc. Bull Head and Georgia Fire Rescue Supply LLC Georgia ), subsidiaries of Ilus , together
with its financial statements are reviewed by an independent auditor. As Ilus's auditors, we have relied on the Review report issued by
Bullhead Georgia's independent auditor. Bullhead Georgia's financial statements were prepared in accordance with US GAAP,
and an independent auditor find no material misstatement in financial statement based on US GAAP. The independent auditor also evaluated
the adequacy of Bullhead and Georgia's accounting and internal control systems and found them to be satisfactory. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Ilustrato Pictures International,
Inc. is currently involved in legal matters towards its ownership of FB Fire Technologies Ltd. FB Fire ). In its previously
filed Form 10 with the SEC, ILUS listed FB Fire as a subsidiary. However, due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the outcome of the
litigation on lien marked shares, ILUS has decided not to consolidate FB Fire's financial statements with its own. Management has informed
us that the lawyers representing ILUS in the case are unable to predict the outcome with certainty. Refer Note No. 19 for details captured
by ILUS for this litigation.

shares with Ambrose 
 Keith canceled as they were issued in error in 2018
as the deal was never completed. The case
 has been won on September 15, 2022, in favor
of the company and the court order was received
on January 23, 2023. The transfer agent cancelled the shares on February 17,
2023. 

We have been named as a defendant in an
action commenced by Steve Nicol, who claims that he loaned 12,000 to a subsidiary of ILUS under a promissory note, but that ILUS agreed
to assume the note. He further claims that he elected to convert the note and that ILUS failed to convert the note into shares of ILUS
common stock. He has alleged breach of contract, declaratory relief, and specific performance to require the company to issue 75,000,000
shares of common stock in ILUS. 

We
have been named as a defendant
in an action commenced by our former CEO, Larson
Elmore. A case also has been filed in the Eight Judicial District Court of the State
 of Nevada (Case No. A-22-858343-C). Plaintiff alleges that we breached a stock
 purchase agreement dated May
10, 2020, and promissory notes and is therefore entitled to damages. We
have potential counterclaims against the former CEO which are being prepared to arise out
of improper action and lack of disclosures. We are in the process of a settlement discussion
and have obtained an extension of time to respond while this process occurs. 

We
cannot predict whether the action against involving
our former CEO or Mr. Nicol is likely to result
in any material recovery or expense to our company.
Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the Company accrues estimates of the
probable costs for the resolution of these
 matters. These estimates
 are based on an analysis of potential results and settlement strategies.
 It is possible, however, that future operating
results for any particular quarter or annual period could be affected by changes
in assumption.

1.2) in effect from time to time, initially 35,000,000) (the Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased (or
decreased with the written consent of the Holder) from time to time in accordance with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The
Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the
Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock
into which the Notes shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision
so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights,
for conversion of the outstanding Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates
for the Common 

2 

Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged
with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Note. 

If, at any time the Borrower does not
maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

1.4 Method of Conversion . 

(a) 
 Mechanics of Conversion . As set forth in Section 1.1 hereof, from time to time, and at any time during the period
beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of this Note and ending on the date of payment of the
Default Amount, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part in accordance with the terms herein, by (A) submitting to
the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date
prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the
Borrower (upon payment in full of any amounts owed hereunder). 

(b) 
 Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of
this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless
the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal
amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower,
so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. 

(c) 
 Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission
or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in
this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates
for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within two (2) business days after such receipt (the Deadline (and,
solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof
and the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record
of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this
Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations hereunder, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities,
cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein,
the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective
of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery
of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation
of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation
of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. 

3 

(d) 
 Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated
Securities Transfer FAST program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions set forth herein,
the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian DWAC system. 

(e) 
 Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue
other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline due to action and/or inaction of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the
Holder 

 2,000 per day in cash, for
each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock (the Fail to Deliver Fee ); provided; however
that the Fail to Deliver Fee shall not be due if the failure is a result of a third party (i.e., transfer agent; and not the result of
any failure to pay such transfer agent) despite the best efforts of the Borrower to effect delivery of such Common Stock. Such cash amount
shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by
written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal
amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal
amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert
is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right
are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this
Section 1.4(e) are justified. 

1.5 
 Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred
unless: (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent
shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel
in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption
from such registration (such as Rule 144 or a successor rule) Rule 144 ); or (iii) such shares are transferred to an affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5
and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). 

Any restrictive legend on certificates
representing shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder
a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel
from Holder s counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect
that (i) a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted
by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected; or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note,
such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Act; or otherwise may be
sold pursuant to an exemption from registration. In the event that the Company does not reasonably accept the opinion of counsel provided
by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration (such as Rule 144), at the Deadline,
it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note.

1.6 Effect of Certain Events . 

(a) 
 Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in
which more than 50 of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of
the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall be deemed to be an
Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation
of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article III). Person shall
mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization. 

(b) 
 Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior
to conversion of all of the Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other
similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares
of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this
Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified
herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which
the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction
(without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect
to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions
for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable,
as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower
shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, ten (10) days
prior written notice (but in any event at least five (5) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders
to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b)
the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Note. The above
provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(c) 
 Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to
acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any
dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary
(i.e., a spin-off)) (a Distribution ), then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after
the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been
payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such
shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution. 

5 

(d) 
 Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance . If, at any time when any Note is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues
or sells, or in accordance with this Section 1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, except for shares of Common Stock issued
directly to vendors or suppliers of the Borrower in satisfaction of amounts owed to such vendors or suppliers (provided, however, that
such vendors or suppliers shall not have an arrangement to transfer, sell or assign such shares of Common Stock prior to the issuance
of such shares), any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses
or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith) less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of
such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a Dilutive Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive
Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive
Issuance. 

The Borrower shall be deemed to have
issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not including employee
stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock Convertible Securities (such warrants, rights and options to purchase Common Stock
or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as Options and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable
upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price
per share. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of
such Options is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for
the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower
upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options, the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first
become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such
Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made
upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities
issuable upon exercise of such Options. 

Additionally, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities, whether
or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per share for which
Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price
shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the price per share for which Common Stock
is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by
the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional
consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become
convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all
such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upo the actual
issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

1.7 
 Prepayment . At any time prior to the date that an Event of Default occurs under this Note, the Borrower shall have

payment of the amounts designated below to or upon the order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower. If the
Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note in accordance with this Section 1.9, the Borrower shall make payment to the Holder of
an amount in cash equal to the sum of: (w) 115 multiplied by the Principal Amount then outstanding plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest
on the Principal Amount to the Optional Prepayment Date plus (y) 750.00 to reimburse Holder for administrative fees.

breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies
at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing

of such receipt, following which the Holder shall have the right in its sole discretion to require the Borrower to immediately apply all
or any portion of such proceeds to repay all or any portion of this Note. Failure of the Borrower to comply with this provision shall
constitute an Event of Default under Section 3.4 of the Note. In the event that such proceeds are received by the Holder prior to the
Maturity Date, the required prepayment shall be subject to the terms of Section 1.7 herein.

would impair its ability to, pay its debts from time to time incurred in connection therewith as such debts mature. The Company did not
receive a qualified opinion from its auditors with respect to its most recent fiscal year end and, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, does not anticipate or know of any basis upon which its auditors might issue a qualified opinion in respect

losses and risks and in such amounts as management of the Company believes to be prudent and customary in the businesses in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able
to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may
be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Upon written request the Company will provide
to the Buyer true and correct copies of all policies relating to directors and officers liability coverage, errors and omissions
coverage, and commercial general liability coverage.

or otherwise terminate such officer s employment with the Company or any such Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company, no executive

of any employment contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement, non- competition agreement, or any other

the case may be) does not subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters.

and employment practices and benefits, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where failure to be in compliance

Amendment and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Agreement or the Note, as applicable. 

2. Amendment to Section 4(m) . Section 4(m) of the
Agreement is hereby amended to replace the words February 28, 2023 with April 1, 2023 . 

3. Amendment to Section 4(o) . Section 4(o) of the
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows. 

o. 
 Commitment Fee Shares . The
Company shall pay to Buyer, (i) as a commitment fee, One Million Six Hundred Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars (US 1,600,000.00)
(the Commitment Fee by issuing to Buyer that number of shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to such amount.
It is agreed that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to Buyer under this Section 4(o) shall be 40,000,000 (the Commitment
Fee Shares ), reflecting a price per Commitment Fee Share of 0.04; provided, that if the Company issues any shares of Common Stock
at a price per share of less than 0.04 prior to the end of 

1 

the Adjustment Period (as defined
below), the Company will issue to Buyer additional Commitment Fee Shares such that the price per share of the aggregate amount of Commitment
Fee Shares (including such additional Commitment Fee Shares) equals such lower price per share. The Company shall instruct the Transfer
Agent to issue three (3) certificates or book entry statements, in the amounts of 18,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 12,000,000 shares
of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, representing the Commitment Fee Shares issuable to the Buyer, immediately upon
the Company s execution of this Agreement, and shall cause the Transfer Agent to deliver such certificates or book entry statements
to Buyer within five (5) business days from the Effective Date. The Buyer shall never be in possession of an amount of Common Stock greater
than 4.99 of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company provided, however that this ownership restriction described in this
Section may be waived by Buyer, in whole or in part, upon sixty-one (61) days prior written notice. In the event any certificate
or book entry representing the Commitment Fee Shares issuable hereunder shall not be delivered to the Buyer within the applicable five
(5) business day period, same shall be an immediate default under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The Commitment Fee
Shares, when issued, shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable shares of the Company s Common Stock.
The Commitment Fee Shares shall be deemed fully earned as of the Effective Date, regardless of the amount or number of Loans made hereunder. 

(i) 
 Adjustments . Subject to
Section 4(o)(ii) below, it is the intention of the Company and Buyer that the Buyer shall be able to sell (if Buyer so elects, in Buyer s
sole and absolute discretion) the Commitment Fee Shares, and generate net proceeds (net of all brokerage commissions and other fees or
charges payable by Buyer in connection with the sale thereof) from such sale equal to the Commitment Fee. The Buyer shall use its best
efforts to sell the Commitment Fee Shares in the principal trading market of the Company s Common Stock or otherwise, at any time
in accordance with applicable securities laws. At any time, and from time to time, the Buyer may elect during the period beginning on
the date which is the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the thirty- nine (39) month anniversary of the Closing
Date (the Adjustment Period ), the Buyer may deliver to the Company a reconciliation statement showing the net proceeds actually
received by the Buyer from the sale of the Commitment Fee Shares (the Sale Reconciliation ). If, as of the date of the delivery
by Buyer of the Sale Reconciliation (the Sale Reconciliation Date ), the Buyer has not realized net proceeds from the sale
of such Commitment Fee Shares equal to at least the Commitment Fee, as shown on the Sale Reconciliation, then the Company shall, within
five (5) business days, either pay in cash the applicable shortfall amount or immediately take all required action necessary or required
in order to cause the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock (priced at the volume weighted average 

2 

price over the ten (10) day period
preceding the applicable Sale Reconciliation Date) to the Buyer in an amount sufficient such that, when sold and the net proceeds thereof
are added to the net proceeds from the sale of any of the previously issued and sold Commitment Fee Shares, the Buyer shall have received
total net funds equal to the Commitment Fee. If additional shares of Common Stock are issued pursuant to this Section 4(o)(i), and after
the sale of such additional issued shares of Common Stock the Buyer still has not received net proceeds equal to at least the Commitment
Fee, then the Company shall again be required to immediately take all required action necessary or required in order to cause the issuance
of additional shares of Common Stock (or the payment of cash) to the Buyer as contemplated above, and such additional issuances (or cash
payments) shall continue until the Buyer has received net proceeds from the sale of such Common Stock equal to the Commitment Fee. In
the event additional Common Stock is required to be issued as outlined above, the Company shall instruct the Transfer Agent to issue certificates
or book entry statements representing such additional shares of Common Stock to the Buyer as promptly as practicable following the Sale
Reconciliation Date, and the Company shall in any event cause the Transfer Agent to deliver such certificates or book entry statements
to Buyer within five (5) business days following the Sale Reconciliation Date; provided, that if by the fifth (5 th business
day following the Sale Reconciliation Date, the Buyer has not received such additional shares of Common Stock (or payment in cash), the
Buyer may notify the Transfer Agent directly of the Company s obligation to deliver such additional shares of Common Stock, and
the Transfer Agent shall issue such additional shares of Common Stock from the Reserved Amount without any further action by the Company.
In the event such certificates or book entry statements representing such additional shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder shall not
be delivered to the Buyer within ten (10) business days of the Sale Reconciliation Date, same shall be an
immediate default under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Nothing herein contained shall be interpreted to in any way
limit the net proceeds from the sale of the Commitment Fee Shares which shall be generated by the Buyer. The Company s obligation
to pay the Commitment Fee contemplated by this Section 4(o) thru the sale of Commitment Fee Shares, shall be an obligation hereunder,
secured by all Transaction Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, all requirements of Rule 144 shall apply to any resale of any additional
shares of Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to an adjustment as described above (to the extent Rule 144 is relied upon in connection
with such resale), including, without limitation, holding period requirements. 

(ii) Reserved . 

3 

4. 
 Previously Issued Commitment Fee Shares . The Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the Company
has previously issued to the Buyer 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock as Commitment Fee Shares, in satisfaction of the Company s
obligations to issue Commitment Fee Shares to the Buyer under the Agreement as in existence prior
to the execution of this Amendment. In connection with the execution of this Amendment, the Buyer and the Company agree and acknowledge
that the Company will be obligated to issue to the Buyer an additional amount of Commitment Fee Shares totaling 10,000,000 shares (the
 Additional Commitment Fee Shares ), and that, upon such issuance, the Company will have satisfied its obligations under Section
4(o) of the Agreement, as amended by this Amendment. 

5. 
 Issuance of Additional Commitment Fee Shares . Within five (5) business days of the date of
this Amendment, the Company, though its transfer agent, will issue to the Buyer the Additional Commitment Fee Shares in one (1) book entry
statement. 

6. 
 Waiver . As of the Effective Date, the Buyer waives the Existing Events of Default. The waiver
contained herein does not apply to any other Default or Event of Default, other than the Existing Events of Default, which may now or
hereafter exist under the Note, the Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. No consent or waiver, express or implied, by the Buyer
to or for any breach of or deviation from any covenant, condition, or duty by the Company, including the waiver of the Existing Events
of Default, shall be deemed a consent or waiver to or of any other breach of the same or any other covenant, condition, or duty set forth
in the Note, the Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. The Buyer s waiver contained herein does not constitute a course
of dealing nor does it constitute a course of conduct. 

7. Miscellaneous . 

a. No Further Amendment . Except as expressly
amended hereby, the Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed and all the terms, conditions, and provisions thereof shall remain
in full force and effect. This Amendment is limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed to be an amendment to any other term
or condition of the Agreement or any other document referred to therein. This Amendment shall be deemed to be in full force and effect

Insider
Trading Policy QIND 

 Introduction 

 The
Board of Directors of QIND has adopted this policy to provide guidelines to all directors, officers, associates and consultants of QIND
with respect to trading in QIND securities, as well as the securities of publicly traded companies with whom QIND has a business relationship. 

 This
policy has been designed to prevent insider trading or even allegations of insider trading. Your strict adherence to this policy will
help safeguard QIND s reputation and will further ensure that QIND conducts its business with the highest level of integrity and
in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Each QIND associate is responsible for the consequences of his or her actions. You are
responsible for understanding and complying with this policy. 

 Federal
and state securities laws prohibit the purchase or sale of a company s securities by anyone who is aware of material information
about that company that is not generally known or available to the public. These laws also prohibit anyone who is aware of material nonpublic
information from disclosing this information to others who may trade. Companies and their controlling persons may also be subject to liability
if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by company personnel. 

 It
is important that you understand the breadth of activities that constitute illegal insider trading and the consequences, which can be
severe. Cases have been successfully prosecuted against trading by associates through foreign accounts, trading by family members and
friends, and trading involving only a small number of shares. Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA investigate and are very effective at detecting insider trading.
Both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice pursue insider trading violations vigorously. 

Sanctions
and Penalties 

 Violations
of the insider trading laws can result in severe civil and criminal sanctions. For example, under U.S. securities laws, individuals may
be subject to imprisonment for up to 20 years, criminal fines of up to 5 million and civil fines of up to three times the profit gained
or loss avoided. Failure to comply with this policy may also subject you to sanctions imposed by QIND, up to and including immediate dismissal
for cause, whether or not your failure to comply with this policy results in a violation of law. 

 Persons
Covered 

 As a
director, officer, associate or consultant of QIND or its subsidiaries, this policy applies to you. The same restrictions that apply to
you apply to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live
in your household but whose transactions in QIND securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents
or children who consult with you before they trade in QIND securities). You are responsible for making sure that any transaction in securities
covered by this policy by any of these people complies with this policy. 

 Definition
of Material Non-Public Information 

 Material
non-public information is any material information about QIND that has not yet become publicly available. 

 Information
is material if a reasonable investor would likely consider it important in making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities.
Any information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of the security is material. The information may be positive or
negative. Financial information is frequently material, even if it covers only part of a fiscal period or less than all of QIND s
operations, since either of these might convey enough information about QIND s 

2 

consolidated results to be considered material information.
Other common examples of information that may be material include: 

information
regarding sales, revenues or earnings (including projections); 

 financial forecasts
of any kind, including earnings estimates or changes in previously announced earnings estimates; 

 significant
business trends and metrics; 

 significant
proposed mergers, acquisitions, investments or divestitures; 

 significant
developments in products or services; 

 gain or loss
of substantial customers; 

 execution or
termination of significant contracts; 

 financings or
restructurings; 

 significant
unusual gains or losses; 

 changes in business
strategies; 

 developments
in significant litigation or government investigations; 

 public or private
debt or equity offerings; 

 significant
changes in senior management; 

 QIND share repurchases;
or 

 stock splits
or dividend information. 

It is
not possible to define all categories of material information, and you should recognize that the public, the media and the courts may
use hindsight in judging what is material. Therefore, it is important to err on the safe side and assume information is material if there
is any doubt. 

 Information
is non-public if it is not generally known or available to the public. Information may still be non-public even though it
is widely known within QIND. 

 Release
of information to the media does not immediately mean the information has become publicly available. Information is considered to be available
to the public only when it has been released broadly to the marketplace (such as by a press release or an SEC filing) and the investing
public has had time to absorb and evaluate it. Ordinarily, information about QIND should not be considered public until at least one full
trading day has passed following its formal release to the market. For example, if QIND announces earnings before trading begins on a
Tuesday, the first time you can buy or sell QIND securities is the opening of the market on Wednesday (assuming you are not aware of other
material non-public information at that time). If, however, QIND announces earnings after trading begins that Tuesday, the first time
you can buy or sell QIND securities is the opening of the market on the Thursday. 

3 

Requirements
Applicable to Everyone 

 No trading
in QIND securities while aware of material non-public information 

 You
are prohibited from engaging in any transaction in QIND securities while aware of material non-public information about QIND. It makes
no difference whether or not you relied upon or used material non-public information in deciding to trade if you are aware of
material non-public information about QIND, the prohibition applies. You should avoid even the appearance of an improper transaction to
preserve QIND s reputation for adhering to the highest ethical standards of conduct. 

 This
prohibition covers virtually all transactions in QIND securities. Securities includes common stock, options to purchase
common stock, debt securities, preferred stock and derivative securities such as put and call options, warrants, swaps, caps and collars.
Transactions in QIND securities include purchases, sales, pledges, hedges, loans and gifts of QIND securities, as well as other direct
or indirect transfers of QIND securities. Certain of these transactions are addressed in more detail below and may not be permitted under
this policy. This prohibition extends to trades of QIND securities in which you have any beneficial or other interest, or
over which you exercise investment control, including: 

transactions in QIND securities held in joint accounts or accounts of persons or entities controlled
directly or indirectly by you; 

transactions in QIND securities for which you act as trustee, executor or custodian; and 

transactions in any other account or investment involving in any way any QIND securities over
which you exercise any direct or indirect control. 

Stock Option
Exercises . This prohibition does not apply to the exercise of stock options issued under QIND plans if the exercise price is paid
in cash or through QIND withholding a portion of the shares underlying the options. Similarly, QIND may withhold underlying shares to
satisfy tax withholding requirements. This prohibition does apply, however, to sales of the underlying stock and broker-assisted cashless
exercises of options, as well as to any other market sales for the purpose of generating the cash needed to cover the costs of exercise. 

4 

Vesting of
Restricted Stock or Settlement of Performance Stock Units . This prohibition does not apply to the automatic deduction of shares by
QIND from your restricted stock or performance stock unit account to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding liability upon the
vesting of restricted stock or settlement of performance stock units. The prohibition does apply, however, to any open market sale of
vested shares, including to satisfy tax liabilities. 

 10b5-1 Plans .
This prohibition does not apply to trades made pursuant to a valid 10b5-1 plan approved by QIND as described below. 

 Dividend Reinvestment
Plan . This prohibition does not apply to purchases of QIND stock under the QIND dividend reinvestment plan that result from your reinvestment
of dividends paid on QIND stock held in such plan. This prohibition does apply, however, to other purchases of QIND stock under the plan
that result from additional contributions you choose to make to the dividend reinvestment plan, or to increases or decreases in your level
of participation in the plan. This prohibition also applies to your sale of any QIND securities purchased pursuant to the plan. 

Event-specific
restricted periods may apply 

Although
you are always responsible for monitoring for yourself whether you possess material non-public information, from time-to-time QIND may
decide to impose a special restricted period on those who are aware of particular information that QIND determines may be
considered material non-public information. This kind of restricted period may be imposed in connection with a potential acquisition,
a financial analyst conference, an anticipated positive or negative earnings surprise or other material development. If you are subject
to the restricted period, you may not trade in any QIND securities, except pursuant to a 10b5 1 plan previously approved by QIND, until
notified that the restricted period has ended. 

 The
Legal Counsel, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Commercial Officer, will determine
whether an event-specific restricted period should be imposed. The existence of an event-specific restricted period will not be generally
announced. If you are covered by the event-specific restricted period, you will be notified by the Legal Counsel. Any person made aware
of an event-specific restricted period should not disclose the existence of the restricted period to anyone else. 

 No trading
in securities of other companies while aware of material non-public information 

 QIND
may engage in business transactions with companies whose securities are publicly traded. These transactions may include, among other
things, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or renewal or termination of significant contracts or other arrangements. Information learned
in connection with these transactions or relationships may constitute material non-public information about the other company. You are
prohibited from trading in the securities of these companies while aware of material non-public information about the companies and from
communicating that information to any other person for such use. 

5 

No tipping 
of material non-public information 

 You
may not pass material non-public information about QIND or any other company on to others or otherwise make unauthorized disclosure or
use of this information, regardless of whether you profit or intend to profit by the tipping, disclosure, or use. This practice, known
as tipping , also violates the securities laws and can result in the same civil and criminal penalties that apply to insider
trading, even though you did not trade and did not gain any benefit from another's trading. 

 Frequent trading
of QIND securities is strongly discouraged 

 Frequent
trading of QIND securities can create an appearance of wrongdoing even if the decision to trade was based solely on public information
such as stock price ranges and other market events. You are strongly discouraged from trading in QIND securities for short-term trading
profits. Daily or frequent trading, which can be time-consuming and distracting, is strongly discouraged. QIND reserves the right to request
brokerage account statements to assure compliance with this and other provisions of the policy. 

 No short sales
of QIND securities 

 You
may not engage in short sales of QIND securities (sales of securities that are not then owned), including sales against the box 
(short sales not exceeding the number of shares already owned). Generally, short sales are transactions whereby a person will benefit
from a decline in the price of the securities, and QIND believes it is inappropriate for associates to engage in these transactions with
respect to QIND securities. 

 No trading
in derivatives of QIND 

 You
may not trade in derivatives of an QIND security, such as exchange-traded put or call options and forward transactions. 

 No hedging
transactions 

 Certain
forms of hedging or monetization transactions may offset a decrease, or limit your ability to profit from an increase, in the value of
QIND securities you hold, enabling you to continue to own QIND securities without the full risks and rewards of ownership. QIND believes
that such transactions separate the holder's interests from those of other stockholders. 

6 

Therefore, you and any person acting on your
behalf are prohibited from purchasing any financial instruments (such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or
exchange funds) or otherwise engaging in any transactions that hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of QIND securities or
limit your ability to profit from an increase in the market value of QIND securities. 

 No margin
accounts or pledges 

 Securities
held in a margin account or pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold without your consent by the broker if you fail to meet a margin
call or by the lender in foreclosure if you default on the loan. Because a margin or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when you are
aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise are not permitted to trade in QIND securities, you are prohibited from holding QIND
securities in a margin account or pledging QIND securities as collateral for a loan. 

 Limited use
of standing orders 

 Standing
orders should be used only for three business days. A standing order placed with a broker to sell or purchase stock at a specified price
leaves you with no control over the timing of the transaction. A standing order transaction executed by the broker when you are aware
of material nonpublic information may result in unlawful insider trading. A standing order incorporated into a 10b5-1 plan approved by
QIND is permitted. 

 No trading
on rumors 

 Rumors
within QIND concerning matters which, if true, would be material non-public information are deemed to constitute material non-public information
for purposes of this policy. Accordingly, you should not trade on the basis of these rumors. 

 Material non-public
information must be kept confidential 

 Material
non-public information about QIND or its business partners is the property of QIND, and unauthorized disclosure or use of that information
is prohibited. That information should be maintained in strict confidence and should be discussed, even within QIND, only with persons
who have a need to know. You should exercise the utmost care and circumspection in dealing with information that may be
material non-public information. Conversations in public places, such as hallways, elevators, restaurants and airplanes, involving information
of a sensitive or confidential nature should be avoided. Written information should be appropriately safeguarded 

7 

and should not be left
where it may be seen by persons not entitled to the information. The unauthorized disclosure of information could result in serious consequences
to QIND, whether or not the disclosure is made for the purpose of facilitating improper trading in securities. 

 Participation
in electronic bulletin boards, twitter, chat rooms, blogs or websites must be consistent with this Policy 

 Any
written or verbal statement that would be prohibited under the law or under this policy is equally prohibited if made on electronic bulletin
boards, chat rooms, blogs, websites or any other form of social media, including the disclosure of material non-public information about
QIND or material non-public information with respect to other companies that you come into possession of as an associate of QIND. 

 Public disclosures
should be made only by designated persons 

 No individuals
other than specifically authorized personnel should release material information to the public or respond to inquiries from the media,
analysts, investors or others outside of QIND. You should not respond to these inquiries unless expressly authorized to do so and should
refer any inquiries to the Vice President, Investor Relations or the Vice President, Corporate Marketing. 

 Post-employment
transactions may be prohibited 

 The
portions of this policy relating to trading while in possession of material non-public information and the use or disclosure of that information
continue to apply to transactions in QIND securities even after termination of employment or association with QIND. If you are aware of
material non-public information about QIND when your employment or other business relationship with QIND ends, you may not trade in QIND
securities or disclose the material non-public information to anyone else until that information is made public or becomes no longer material. 

 Exceptions 

 In
certain limited circumstances, a transaction otherwise prohibited by this policy may be permitted if, prior to the transaction, the Legal
Counsel determines that the transaction is not inconsistent with the purposes of this policy. The existence of a personal financial emergency
does not excuse you from compliance with this policy and will not be the basis for an exception to the policy for a transaction that
is inconsistent with the purposes of the policy. 

8 

Additional
Requirements Applicable to Restricted Persons 

 Restricted
Persons are those who are at an enhanced risk of possessing inside information and who therefore must exercise greater
diligence to comply with insider trading prohibitions. This group includes all members of the Board of Directors, officers and certain
senior finance, legal, HR, business development, investor relations, corporate communication and management associates at corporate headquarters
and in QIND s business units, as well as any other associates in a role that makes it likely they will have involvement with material
non-public information. This list is updated on a quarterly basis by the Legal Counsel in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer.
You will be notified by the Legal Counsel if you are considered a Restricted Person under this policy. 

 If you
are a Restricted Person that is not a director or executive officer, the procedures set forth in this section of the policy will cease
to apply to your transactions in QIND securities upon the expiration of any restricted period that is applicable to your transactions
at the time your employment or other relationship with QIND ends. Directors will remain Restricted Persons for a period of six months
following the last day of service as a director of QIND, and executive officers will remain Restricted Persons for a period of six months
following the last day of employment with QIND. 

 Quarterly
restricted periods 

 No Restricted
Person may trade in QIND securities during a quarterly restricted period, regardless of whether they are then actually aware of material
non-public information. 

 A quarterly
restricted period is in effect with respect to each quarterly earnings announcement, starting on the 15th day of the third month of the
applicable QIND fiscal quarter and ending when one full trading day has passed following the public announcement of QIND s quarterly
financial results. QIND has selected this period because it is the time when there is likely to be material non-public information about
QIND that may be available to Restricted Persons. 

 For
certain Restricted Persons designated by the Legal Counsel, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Commercial Officer from time to time, the quarterly restricted period may start prior to the 15th day of the third month of
the quarter. 

9 

Notwithstanding
the above, a quarterly restricted period does not prohibit trading in QIND securities pursuant to a valid pre-existing 10b5-1 plan approved
by QIND as described below. 

 Trading pre-clearance
requirement for certain Restricted Persons 

 Certain
Restricted Persons designated by the Legal Counsel, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and
the Chief Commercial Officer from time to time, must obtain pre-clearance by QIND s Legal Counsel or, in his or her absence, QIND s
Chief Financial Officer (each an Approving Person before engaging in any transaction involving QIND securities, including,
but not limited to, purchases, sales, and gifts. Those Restricted Persons who are required to obtain pre-clearance will be notified from
time to time by the Legal Counsel of the applicable pre-clearance or other procedures applicable to them. Each Approving Person should
consult with the other Approving Person, or his or her designee, prior to granting pre-clearance for trades. Neither Approving Person
may engage in a transaction in QIND securities unless the other Approving Person has pre-cleared the transaction. 

 The
Approving Persons are under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance and may determine not to permit a transaction,
even if it would not violate the federal securities laws or a specific provision of this policy. In certain circumstances, other associates
may be asked to clear with an Approving Person all proposed transactions before initiating them. The fact that a particular intended trade
has been denied pre-clearance should be treated as confidential information and should not be disclosed to any person unless authorized
by the Approving Person. 

 If a
request for pre-clearance is approved, you have three business days to effect the transaction (or, if sooner, before commencement of a
quarterly or event-specific restricted period). Under no circumstance may a person trade while aware of material non-public information
about QIND, even if pre-cleared. Thus, if you become aware of material non-public information after receiving pre-clearance, but before
the trade has been executed, you must not effect the pre-cleared transaction. 

 QIND s
approval of any particular transaction under this pre-clearance procedure does not insulate any Restricted Person from liability under
the securities laws. Under the law, the ultimate responsibility for determining whether an individual is aware of material non-public
information about QIND rests with that individual in all cases. 

10 

10b5-1
Plans 

 SEC
Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 permits corporate insiders to establish written trading plans (commonly referred
to as 10b5-1 plans that can be useful in enabling insiders to plan ahead without fear that they might become exposed to
material non-public information that will prevent them from trading. Where a valid 10b5-1 plan has been established at a time when the
insider was not in possession of material non-public information, trades executed as specified by the plan do not violate the securities
laws or this policy even if the insider is in possession of material non-public information at the time the trade is executed. Trades
executed as specified by the plan are not subject to the pre-clearance requirement. 

 To qualify
as a 10b5-1 plan for purposes of this policy, the plan must be approved in advance by the Legal Counsel, and you should allow at least
three business days for that approval. One of the factors that the Legal Counsel may consider in determining whether to approve a 10b5-1
plan is compliance with QIND s applicable minimum stock ownership guidelines. These pre-planned trading programs are available only
to officers and such other QIND associates as may be designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial
Officer and the Legal Counsel. For more information about how to establish a 10b5-1 plan, please contact the Legal Counsel. QIND reserves
the right to disapprove any submitted plan, and to suspend or instruct you to terminate any plan that it has previously approved. 

 Inquiries 

 Any
questions about this policy, its application to a proposed transaction, or the requirements of applicable laws should be directed to the
Legal Counsel.
