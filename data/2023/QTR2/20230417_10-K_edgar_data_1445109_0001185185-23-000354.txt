Overview 

Over the past decade, Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. has developed processes that address what we believe are the key technology priorities of the global coal industry. We currently have three processes in our intellectual property portfolio: 

The original process, called Pristine, is designed to remove moisture and volatile matter, rendering a high-efficiency, cleaner thermal coal. The process has been tested successfully on bituminous and subbituminous coals, and lignite from various parts of the United States and from numerous countries around the world. 

Our second process, called Pristine-M, is a low-cost coal dehydration technology. In tests, this process has succeeded in drying coal economically and stabilizing it using volatile matter released by the feed coal. Construction of our coal testing plant was completed in December 2015 and was successfully tested through April 2016 at AES Coal Power Utility in Oklahoma. Additional tests commenced and were completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. This test facility has been moved from AES to Wyoming where reassembly has commenced and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of the reassembly. Changes identified to the process by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractors will be included in the reassembly and it is expected to provide a higher quality end product with a lower capital cost for a commercial unit. The reassembly was delayed due to the pandemic but is expected to be completed in Q3 2023. 

Our third process, called Pristine-SA, is designed to eliminate 100 of the volatile matter in the feed coal and to achieve stable combustion by co-firing it with biomass or natural gas. The process is expected to produce a cleaner fuel that eliminates the need for emissions scrubbers and the corollary production of toxic coal ash. We anticipate that treated coal that is co-fired with other energy resources will burn as clean as natural gas. 

Anticipated Benefits of the Technology: 

Reduction of undesired emissions and greenhouse gases through the removal of compounds that are not required for combustion in conventional boilers. 

Cost savings and environmental impact reduction. Our pre-combustion solution is expected to be significantly less expensive than post-combustion solutions such as emissions scrubbers. Not only are the latter prohibitively expensive, they produce coal ash containing the scrubbed compounds, which is dumped in toxic waste disposal sites where it may pose continuing environmental risk. Coal treated using our processes may eliminate the need for post-combustion emissions scrubbers and the resulting toxic ash. By beneficiating the coal it requires less coal to be consumed to achieve the same energy output. This will save on transportation and handling costs. 

Potential use of compounds removed from treated coal. Volatile matter captured in the Pristine process is removed in the form of hydrocarbon liquids that we believe will be easily blended with crude oil or used as feedstock for various products. For example, sulfur, which can be removed using the Pristine process, is a basic feedstock for fertilizer. The harvesting of hydrocarbon liquids from abundant, cheaper coal is a potentially lucrative side benefit of our processes. All coal by-products including Rare Earth Minerals extraction will be tested in the second-generation facility.

Successful testing of the Pristine M process resulted in an increase in BTU of the processed coal and a reduction in moisture content making it less expensive to transport (as moisture has been removed) with the end product being a dust free stabilized enhanced coal which we believe will address the issue of coal dust pollution during transportation. 

Energy Independence. To the extent that volatile matter is removed from coal, coal s use as an energy resource is greatly improved, enabling the United States and other coal-rich countries to move towards energy independence owing to coal s greater abundance. Extraction of by-products including Rare Earth Minerals is also expected to provide coal derivative product independence. 

Development Status: 

Pristine process. Pristine process successfully lab tested on small scale and through advanced computer modeling. As at November, 2020, various aspects of the Pristine process were successfully tested at our test facility at the AES coal Power plant in Oklahoma as part of the overall testing of Pristine M. The second-generation facility in Wyoming is expected to perform a more detailed testing of the Pristine process. The build out and delivery of the Rotary Kiln will enable the test facility to reach significantly higher temperatures to test with more accuracy the Pristine process. 

Pristine-M. Testing of the Pristine M process on Powder River Basin coal at the AES facility in Oklahoma was completed in December 2017. The Pristine M process was successfully tested and the process, engineering and science were independently proven. The test facility was moved from the AES location to Wyoming where reassembly commenced in Q4 2019 and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of reassembly. The reassembly was delayed due to the pandemic but it is expected to be completed in Q3 2023. Over several months in 2018 and early 2019 the University of Wyoming independently validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory. By coating the exterior of the coal during the stabilization period with heavy hydrocarbons the process produces dust free stabilized coal for transportation. 

Pristine-SA process. Pristine SA process analysis is at a very early stage. Further research and development is expected using the test facility at its permanent location in Wyoming. The introduction of the Rotary Kiln and the higher temperatures it can achieve will enable a more accurate testing protocol for this process. 

Business Outlook 

Wyoming New Power, a related party company, has agreed to sign a two million ton per annum license agreement to use Pristine M at a location in Wyoming. They have paid a non-refundable 100,000 deposit on the license agreement. The definitive license agreement is expected to be signed following the receipt of commercial design which will incorporate the suggested changes proposed by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractor. Wyoming New Power is a Related Party because it is controlled by a party that also controls the entity, which is the major lender and significant stockholder of the Company. 

Jindal Steel Power is expected to send though their coal for sampling immediately following the plants re-assembly. The bespoke commercial facility design is expected after the testing. 

			 In Q2, 2019 the Company signed a non binding MOU with Universitas Indonesia in a combined effort to assess the impact of our technology on Indonesian Coal both from a coal beneficiation perspective and also coal by-products. 

			 The second-generation test facility will have the capability of producing Char. There is local Wyoming demand for this product that the company expects to sell. 

The Company entered into a partnership with the University of Wyoming with the sole focus of using our suite of technologies to increase the use of and value of Wyoming Powder River Basin coal. Primary focus is on utilizing our technology to extract valuable derivative products from coal. Changes to the process have been identified by the University and the company EPC engineers and will be incorporated in the reassembly of the facility in Wyoming. The University confirmed in Q2, 2019 that they had successfully validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory and as a result entered into an agreement with the Company. The agreement between the University and the Company is for the reassembly of the second generation test facility. The University will advance to the EPC contractor on a two to one basis. As of the date of this filing the University has advanced a total of approx. 1,300,000 directly to the manufacturer of the Rotary Kiln. The company has recognized in its accounts a payable due to the University of Wyoming of 1,000,000 which will be part of a co-share use of the kiln. The kiln and all its relevant control panels was delivered to our site at Gillette, Wyoming in June 2020.

The Company has been engaged with AusTrade (The Australian Trade and Investment Commission) and through that relationship has partnered with three separate universities in Australia. Like the University of Wyoming these Universities have a focus on their local coal both from a beneficiation perspective and also extracting derivative by products from coal using our technology. The Company received full Australian patents in Q2, 2019 so the company plans to move forward with this relationship in Q3, 2023 following the assembly of the second-generation test facility. 

The Company continues in discussions with the Minister for Coal in India and a number of the Energy governmental bodies in India. Coal samples are expected to be sent for testing once the Second Generation Test Facility is assembled which is expected in Q3, 2023 but subject to potential delays due to the current pandemic. 

Meetings occurred in Q2, 2019 with the US DOE, DOD and Wyoming State Representatives to further our technology to benefit US coal. These discussions continue through March 2023 in light of coal mining bankruptcies in Wyoming. 

Technology 

Our original Pristine coal treating process extracts the volatile matter (solidified gases or pollutant material) from a wide variety of coal types by heating the mineral as it transitions through several disparate heat chambers, causing the volatile matter to turn to gas and escape the coal, leaving behind a cleaner-burning fuel source. Historically, the primary technological challenge of extracting this volatile matter has been maintaining the structural and chemical integrity of the carbon, while achieving enough heat to turn the volatile matter into a gaseous state. Heating coal to temperatures well in excess of 700 Fahrenheit is necessary to quickly turn volatile matter gaseous. However, heating coal to these temperatures has generally caused the carbon in the coal to disintegrate into an unusable fine powder (coal dusting). Our patented flow process transitions the coal through several atmospherically independent heat chambers controlled at increasingly higher temperatures. These heat chambers are infused with inert gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), preventing the carbon from combusting. We have identified the optimum combination of atmospheres, levels of inert gases, transport speed, and temperatures necessary to quickly extract and capture volatile matter, while maintaining the structural and chemical integrity of the coal. Using our technology, we are able to capture the volatile gases that escape the coal, and to utilize some of these gases to fuel the process, while others are captured in the form of usable byproducts, to potentially provide an ancillary revenue stream. Depending on the characteristics of the coal being cleaned, the flow processing time is expected to be in the range of 6 to 8 minutes. 

Our process derivatives are broadly characterized by the following three elements which vary according to the characteristics of the feed coal: 

A first stream is predominantly water that is extracted from the coal. Although expected to be 100 pure (water removed from coal is condensed from its vapor state), it may contain some contaminants. 

A second stream, produced in the de-volatizing stage of the process, is the condensed light hydrocarbons gases that we call coal-derived liquids , or CDLs. These could prove to be the most valuable component of the process. It is anticipated that the CDLs will resemble a crude oil (probably sweet crude if the sulfur content of the feed coal is low) resulting in a readily-marketable product. In the Pristine-M process, de-volatization is controlled and optimized to meet the needs of drying and stabilizing the coal, minimizing the production of gas or liquid byproducts. 

The third stream is the heavy tar-like liquid potentially marketable to the asphalt and coal tar industry. This stream is entirely absent in the Pristine-M process which is focused only on the task of drying and stabilizing. 

The Pristine technology has three distinct primary applications: the cleaning of coal for direct use as fuel for power stations and other industrial and commercial applications; the extraction of potentially valuable chemical by-products for commercial sale; and the use of processed coal as a feed stock for gasification and liquefaction (CTG CTL) projects. 

Pristine-M De-Watering Process . During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company filed a provisional patent application for a new technology focused on the de-watering of coal. The new process, Pristine-M, is unique in that it retains elements of the original process but has discovered a technology that stabilizes the dried coal, rendering it impermeable and easy to transport with low to no risk of spontaneous combustion. The latter results have proved elusive for the majority of companies that have entered the market with coal de-watering technologies.

The Pristine-M process, sharing some of the scientific principles and engineering components that underpin the Pristine process, is also a modular design that includes a section where the coal is partially de-volatized and then coupled to as many drying and stabilization modules as may be required to achieve a client s desired level of production. Each of the modules is designed to handle 30-tons/hr and, similar to the Pristine process, relies on components that are primarily available off-the-shelf and have already stood the test of time as to their reliability and durability. 

Pristine-SA Process. In June 2013, we filed a provisional patent application for a new process to be called Pristine-SA. The new process is designed to produce a coal product that is devoid of all volatiles and comes together with a solution for ensuring efficient and clean combustion on a level with natural gas. Now that the application on the basic concept has been filed, we expect to continue further research and development to address Pristine-SA s potential application in various fuel and non-fuel product areas. 

Our technology has been tested and proven under laboratory and pilot scale conditions in Pittsburg, PA, and the results studied by LEIDOS (previously SAIC) as well as certain potential strategic partners as part of their due diligence on CCTI and the CCTI technology. To date, testing of about 40 coal types from all over the world has been completed. We have also benchmarked our technology against the Carnegie Mellon simulation model with excellent results. Testing has shown no evidence of coal dusting, self-combustion, moisture re-absorption, or other technical concerns that might hinder commercialization. We have successfully tested Powder River Basin coal at out testing facility at AES Oklahoma. The test facility was moved to Wyoming where assembly completion of the second generation test facility is expected in the third quarter of 2023. 

While we believe that all of our Pristine technologies offer vast potential for commercialization, our market entry strategy right now is focused on the Pristine -M technology that we believe offers an immediate opportunity to monetize our intellectual property. The specific opportunity is in Asia that, at the moment, is focused almost entirely on the need to produce a dry and stable coal to meet the growing need of coal-fired power plants. Indonesia is currently one of the largest suppliers of thermal coal to India and China, but Indonesian coal suffers from its high moisture content and low calorific content. Since January 2017 we have engaged in advanced discussions with the representatives from the US DOE and also key representatives from Wyoming. As we successfully tested PRB at our test facility at AES it has led to a unique opportunity to upgrade PRB coal and export it through several ports in the US and also from Canadian and Mexican ports. Since our successful tests at AES coal power utility we believe that the issues currently facing the upgrading of coal and its stabilization have been effectively addressed by the Pristine-M technology and we continue to work with both US government bodies and US producers along with key international energy providers. 

Initial designs have been completed for both the Pristine and the Pristine-M processes. The Pristine design provides for the deployment of standard operational modules, each with annual capacity of 166,000 metric tons, providing the flexibility to be configured in accordance with customers individual production capacity requirements. The coal cleaning process will typically be energy self-sufficient, relying upon captured methane and other byproducts to fuel the coal cleaning process. Since 2018 our EPC contractor in conjunction with the University of Wyoming have been working to further enhance the process and update the commercial designs that were previously produced. Following nine months of work with the University of Wyoming and our engineers we have identified changes to the original test facility that is expected to further increase the beneficiated processed coal. These changes have been incorporated in the reassembly of the second generation test facility in Wyoming. 

Business Activities and Strategy 

The Company s business model at this stage is simple: to license our technology to third parties and exact a license fee, as well as a royalty fee, based on plant production. Over time, as the company builds up equity capital and cash reserves, opportunities to penetrate the coal business at different points of the value chain will be considered. Among these, direct investments in low-cost reserves, partnerships in mining or industrial projects, or trading may be contemplated. 

Research and development will be a key focus going forward. The highest priority will be on the commercialization of our Pristine M process, but there are various other product areas including biomass where our technology may prove relevant. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe our technology and designs represent the only process that can effectively separate and capture undesired chemical compounds prior to carbon combustion in a commercially viable manner. Our process differs from competing processes through its ability to maintain the structural integrity of coal during the heating process. This is achieved through a unique design that inserts inert gas into the heating chambers, and maintains the inert atmosphere in each chamber. By inserting an inert gas into the chambers, the process allows for rapid heating of the coal and prevents coal combustion and significant coal dusting. Competing technologies have used differing methods of preventing coal combustion and dusting, albeit with limited success. Some of the particular strengths of our process include:

Table of Contents 

Pollution reduction: By heating coal prior to combustion, we are able to extract volatile matter (pollutants in the form of solidified gases) from the coal in a controlled environment, transforming coal with high levels of impurities, contaminants and other polluting elements into a more efficient, cleaner source of high energy, lower polluting fuel. Testing has demonstrated that our process removes a substantial percentage of harmful pollutants, including mercury. The processed end product is dust free so concerns about coal dust loss during transportation is eliminated. 

Lower cost of operation: We believe that our process will be a relatively low-cost solution to the reduction of pollution at coal-fired power facilities. Our engineering consulting firm, believes that our coal cleaning process will typically not require any external energy and can be fully fueled by the methane and other byproducts that the process captures from raw coal. This effective use of byproducts contrasts markedly with emissions scrubbers that generally use a portion of the generated power and have high initial capital and maintenance costs. In addition, our process may have certain advantages in terms of the pollutants removed that can be utilized in a complementary manner with other processes including scrubbers. 

Increased flexibility in feedstock: Our process eliminates both the moisture and volatile matter in raw coal, increasing the heat capacity of standard sub-bituminous low-rank raw coal from approximately 8,800 BTUs to between 11,000-12,000 BTUs. We believe the process can increase heat capacity of lignite raw coal ranging from 4,000-7,000 BTUs to a range of 9,000-10,000 BTUs. As the worldwide supply of high-BTU bituminous coal dwindles, our technology may enable coal-fired plants to effectively utilize the abundance of low-rank coal. Results will differ depending on the coal being processed. 

Favorable price arbitrage: Low-rank coal in Asia with a heat content of 7,000 9,000 BTUs currently sells for at a significant discount to high-BTU bituminous coal with a heat capacity of 10,000+ BTUs, as can be observed in various international price indices, among them, the Baltic Dry Bulk Index. Our process essentially transforms low-grade coal into bituminous coal at a direct operating cost of an estimated 3.50 per ton, capturing the value of higher-grade coal prices. 

Potential tax benefits: This will be clearer under the new US Administration and the new laws being passed. 

Competition 

At this filing, the coal upgrade industry globally, excluding coking processes, remains in its infancy. The penetration rate of technologies focused on de-watering coal is well under 1 based on annual production of thermal coals measured in the billions of tons. There are numerous competitors in the pre-combustion, upgrade segment but many of these have failed, are inactive, or in pilot mode. The Company believes that given its successful testing of its Pristine M process it will be able to enjoy early-mover advantage in 2023. 

The difficulties experienced by the Company s competitors fall into three categories: the technologies have failed to scale up; they are expensive and, therefore, challenge the economics of the process; or they have failed to produce a stable end product, that is, a product that does not reabsorb moisture and is safe to transport with minimal risk of spontaneous combustion. From a scale-up perspective, CCTI s Pristine M technology faces a much smaller challenge as it is a modular system built around well-known and proven components. From our 2-ton per hour prototype to our 30-ton per hour standard commercial module, initial scale-up is a 1:15 proposition that is considered very modest from an engineering perspective. Scalability issues are mitigated by the modular nature of the industrial design that, once the basic module is operational, further scale up is achieved by adding identical modules. We consider it a major competitive advantage that our clients who build large capacity, single-unit plants based on what are likely to be new and untested components. 

From a plant reliability and maintenance perspective, our modular design brings many advantages that the Company believes enhance the competitiveness of its offering. The major benefits are the ability to carry on maintenance on one module while the other modules continue to operate. Down-time can be minimized. Similarly, if a component breaks down, it does not incapacitate the entire plant. It is localized to a single module. 

From a planning perspective, mine operators would be able to expand their capacity piecemeal rather than in step-wise fashion by large-scale increments. This mitigates much of the financial risk normally attendant on large-scale plant expansions and, over time, our modular design may prove to be one of the most significant competitive advantages of our process. 

Another significant competitive advantage of either of the Company s processes is that these do not require crushing of the coal, thereby minimizing if not entirely eliminating the need for costly briquetting. CCTI s plant economics are compelling as they derive much of the process heat from the feed coal itself, rendering the processes very energy efficient. The processes require a modest amount of electric power and a small number of operatives. Consequently, our operating costs are very competitive.

The Pristine process not only removes the moisture, but also removes undesired volatiles which we capture as a chemical soup that may be further refined by us, or sold directly to chemical manufacturers, or refineries as a complementary revenue source. The Pristine process addresses a very different market need than the Pristine M Technology and therefore enables CCTI to offer a more diverse product slate to our potential customers than most, if not all, our existing competitor base. 

We consider our most direct competition in the reduction of coal emissions comes from companies offering pre-combustion cleaning designed to remove impurities. However, post-combustion filtering or scrubbers designed to filter released gases are a clear alternative for coal-fired power producers. We are not in competition with suppliers of emissions scrubbers, except to the extent that that burning a cleaner fuel is more economical than post-combustion solutions. 

The best known present and past competitors in the pre-combustion area include Evergreen Energy, Inc. Evergreen ), Kobe Steel Kobe ), GTL Energy GTL and White Energy White Energy ), both the latter of which are Australian companies. Neither Encoal or SynCoal are currently operational having experienced serious problem in the area of product stability. There are operators that utilize older, less efficient technologies such as the Fleissner process, but these are not as effective the newer technologies. Evergreen, based in Denver, Colorado, developed a technology primarily focused on reducing the moisture in raw coal to increase its heating capacity. The company declared bankruptcy in 2012 after suffering problems having to do with the stability of the end product. CoalTek, based in Tucker, Georgia, claims its patent-pending process uses electromagnetic energy to reduce contaminants and moisture in coal prior to combustion. While public information is limited, we believe the amount of energy necessary to run the electromagnetic process may offset any economic benefits of the upgraded coal. The Australian processes use a combination of heat and compaction to remove moisture from coal. The company is not in commercial mode. White Energy claims that compaction generates close bonding between the dried coal particles to form a high density, higher energy content briquette. Energy requirements for heating coal an operating a pelletizer are typically large but no basis or explanation is provided for the favorable cost numbers published by White Energy. During 2012, White Energy was forced to abandon further investment in its flagship 1 million ton facility in Indonesia that suffered serious operational problems. The Kobe process is proven. However, the plant is complex and, consequently, very expensive. This was indicated by the fact a one significant plant in Indonesia shuttered a Kobe plant during 2012 owing to unfavorable process economics. 

Indirect competition comes from alternative low-pollution energy sources, including: wind, bio-fuels and solar; all of which need additional technological advancements, cost reduction and universal acceptance to be able to produce power at the scale of coal-fueled plants, which today produce over 40 of world s electricity according to U.S. Department of Energy. 

Patents 

Our technology is the subject of U.S. patent #6,447,559, Treatment of Coal which was filed on November 3, 2000 based on provisional application 60/163,566 filed November 5, 1999, and issued in 2002. We also filed PCT international patent application PCT/US00/41772 based on this U.S. patent on November 2, 2000, and, in accordance with this, patents have been applied for in all countries where we believe our technology has application. On February 1, 2011 CCTI was awarded a continuation patent US #7,879,117. 

On April 15, 2008, the Company filed a PCT International application PCT/US2008/060364based on our revised design, and national patent applications based on this PCT International application have been filed in India, China, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and the Republic of Mongolia. These were filed by our patent attorneys Nixon Vanderhye P.C. at a cost of 33,000. On October 15, 2010, the Company filed the PCT US national phase application for its revised design as contained in PCT/US2008/060364. 

The April 15, 2008 application details the process of using byproducts to power the process, and details a simpler, vertical factory design with proprietary seals that help preserve the atmosphere of each chamber, compared to a horizontal design in the original filing. This application goes into great detail regarding the byproducts of the coal and their capture. 

The patent details a process wherein coal is heated to different temperatures in various chambers with controlled low-oxygen atmospheres. There are seals between these chambers, serving to maintain the heat and gas content in each chamber. The invention notes the controlled de-volatilization and removal of moisture and organic volatiles, while maintaining the structural integrity of the coal and reducing the level of disintegration into powder form. The invention also notes the significantly decreased time in treating coal as compared to alternative approaches, most of which focus on moisture removal as a means of increasing calorific or BTU value.

In September, 2011, the Company filed provisional patent application Serial No. 61/531,791 that seeks to protect a new invention for the reduction of moisture inherent in coal, and stabilization of the final product. A corresponding PCT International application PCT/US2012/054160 was filed in September, 2012 and counterpart national patent applications have been filed in US, EP, Eurasia, Australia, Canada, India, Philippines, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia Mongolia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka. Testing to date indicates that our stabilized product will be resistant to moisture re-absorption and safe to handle, even over long distances. The new invention draws from the scientific knowledge embedded in our existing patent, but it is an entirely new concept that is easily differentiated from the offerings of our competitors. The most novel aspect relates to the stabilization of the end product and to the ability to enhance the heat content of the coal beyond what would be normally achieved by moisture removal alone. The product is banded Pristine M. 

From a commercial perspective, Pristine-M is proving to be attractive to clients not only because of its characteristics, but because the industrial design is simple, elegant and inexpensive. We estimate that operating costs based on US labor rates is 3.50 per to which includes 2.00 per ton on-going maintenance. The cost of the commercial plant is expected to be highly competitive, based on preliminary estimates. Changes being incorporated to the second generation test facility is expected to reduce the capital cost of a commercial unit. 

A new provisional patent application Serial No. 61/829,006 was filed by the Company in May, 2013 directed to the treatment of coal. Counterpart foreign patents has been filed based on that technology. In the second quarter of 2013, we filed a provisional patent application for a new process to be called Pristine-SA. The new process is designed to produce a coal product that is devoid of all volatiles and comes together with a solution for ensuring efficient and clean combustion on a level with natural gas. Now that the application on the basic concept has been filed, we expect to continue further research and development to address Pristine-SA s potential application in various fuel and non-fuel product areas. 

We expect to file for additional patents as we continue the commercialization of our technology and factory design. We intend to continue to seek worldwide protection for all our technology. The following table provides a summary of our technology to date. 

In 2019, the company was successfully awarded full patents for the following countries; Indonesia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, United States, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The duration of most patents is 20 years from date of application. 

In 2021, the company was successfully awarded full patents for Canada and South Africa. 

In September 2021, the company applied for a provisional global patent with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office and was assigned USPTO application number 63/248,035. This patent incorporates the additional changes to the company process which includes but not limited to the introduction of a rotary kiln.

Governmental Regulations 

Environmental Regulation Affecting our Potential Market 

We believe that under the Biden administration legislation and regulations will have a negative impact on fossil fuel-fired, and specifically coal-fired, power generating facilities nationally and internationally. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, power generation emits substantial levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and carbon dioxide into the environment. Regulation of these emissions affected the potential market for coal processed using our technology by imposing limits and caps on fossil fuel emissions. The most significant, existing national legislation and regulations affecting our potential market include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the Clean Air Mercury Rule, which are described further below. 

Environmental Regulation Affecting the Construction and Operation of Plants Using our Technology 

In the United States, future production plants using our technology will require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from appropriate federal, state and local governmental agencies before construction of each facility can begin and will be required to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations (including obtaining operating permits) once facilities begin production. The most significant types of permits that are typically required for commercial production facilities include an operating and construction permit under the Clean Air Act, a wastewater discharge permit under the Clean Water Act, and a treatment, storage and disposal permit under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Some federal programs have delegated regulatory authority to the states and, as a result, facilities may be required to secure state permits. Finally, the construction of new facilities may require review under the National Environmental Policy Act, or a state equivalent, which requires analysis of environmental impacts and, potentially, the implementation of measures to avoid or minimize these environmental impacts. We are working closely with Wyoming to assess all permitting requirements. 

Any international plants will also be subject to various permitting and operational regulations specific to each country. International initiatives, such as the Kyoto Protocol/Copenhagen Accord, are expected to create increasing pressures on the electric power generation industry on a world-wide basis to reduce emissions of various pollutants, which management expects will create additional demand for our technology. 

Research and Development 

In association with our engineering consultants and the University of Wyoming we have identified a number of changes to the original test facility. While our budget does not currently allow us to allocate a specific funding for Research and Development R D ), we will incorporate these changes to the assembly of the second generation test facility in Wyoming in the third quarter of 2023 During 2011 we invented the new Pristine M technology which following its successful testing in 2016 and 2017 we believe has already put us at the forefront of the global moisture removal technologies. The second generation test facility is expected to enable the extraction of coal by-products and potentially Rare Earth Minerals for testing and research in partnership with the University of Wyoming.

Table of Contents 

In the future, we anticipate a growing R D budget that seeks to fully develop the potential of our three main processes. We will continue to evaluate our progress in new and existing technologies and will seek to fund additional needs as they arise. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we had two full-time executives, President and CEO Robin Eves, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Aiden Neary, who both have written employment agreements. Messrs. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors. 

The terms of the agreements described above were negotiated by and between the individuals and our Board of Directors based on the qualifications and requirements of each individual and the needs of the Company; however, the negotiations may not be deemed to have been at arm s length.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We have limited licensing revenues to date and we have made no provision for any contingency, unexpected expenses or increases in costs that may arise. 

We have received only limited licensing revenues from operations to date. We have generated operational funding in fiscal 2022 from private debt and equity offerings to use for operating expenses or research and development. Since inception, we have been able to cover our operating losses from debt and equity financing. These sources of funds may not be available to cover future operating losses. If we are not able to obtain adequate sources of funds to operate our business we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

Our business strategy and plans could be adversely affected in the event we need additional financing and are unable to obtain such funding when needed. It is possible that our available funds may not be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, development plans, and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Insufficient funds may prevent us from implementing our business strategy or may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate certain opportunities for the commercialization of our technology. If we cannot obtain necessary funding, then we may be forced to cease operations. 

We may experience delays in resolving unexpected technical issues arising from the design of commercial units that will increase development costs and make the economics unattractive. 

As we develop, refine and implement our technology on a commercial basis, we may have to solve technical, manufacturing and/or equipment-related issues. Some of these issues are ones that we cannot anticipate because the technology we are developing is new. If we must revise existing manufacturing processes or order specialized equipment to address a particular issue, we may not meet our projected timetable for bringing commercial operations on line. Such delays may interfere with our projected operating schedules, delay our receipt of licensing and royalty revenues from operations and decrease royalties from operations. Enhanced commercial designs are underway. 

The market in which we are attempting to sell our technology is highly competitive and may attract significant additional research and development in coming years. 

The market for our technology may become highly competitive on a global basis, with a number of competitors gaining significantly greater resources and greater market share than us. Because of greater resources and more widely accepted brand names, many of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in the markets we have targeted or devote greater resources to the development and sale of new technology products. Our ability to compete is dependent on our emerging technology that may take some time to develop market acceptance. To improve our competitive position, we may need to make significant ongoing investments in service and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection. We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or to secure a competitive position within the market we target. 

Our business depends on the protection of our patents and other intellectual property and may suffer if we are unable to adequately protect such intellectual property. 

Our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our intellectual property. We rely on patent laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we license our technology. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that may be issued to us. 

We have been granted several global patents and have several patents applications pending as noted in the table above. Our ability to license our technology is substantially dependent on the validity and enforcement of these patents and patents pending. We cannot assure you that our patents will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that patents will be issued for our patents pending, that the rights granted under the patents will provide us competitive advantages or that our current and future patent applications will be granted.

Third parties may invalidate our patents. 

Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us based on, among other things: 

subsequently discovered prior art; 

lack of entitlement to the priority of an earlier, related application; or 

failure to comply with the written description, best mode, enablement or other applicable requirements. 

United States patent law requires that a patent must disclose the best mode of creating and using the invention covered by a patent. If the inventor of a patent knows of a better way, or best mode, to create the invention and fails to disclose it, that failure could result in the loss of patent rights. Our decision to protect certain elements of our proprietary technologies as trade secrets and to not disclose such technologies in patent applications, may serve as a basis for third parties to challenge and ultimately invalidate certain of our related patents based on a failure to disclose the best mode of creating and using the invention claimed in the applicable patent. If a third party is successful in challenging the validity of our patents, our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business. 

We may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others. 

Our technology may be the subject of claims of intellectual property infringement in the future. Our technology may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, could divert resources and attention and could require us to obtain a license to use the intellectual property of third parties. We may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. Even if a license is available, we may have to pay substantial royalties to obtain it. If we cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, we may be precluded from offering most or all of technology and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 

Our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel. 

Our technology is being marketed by a small number of the members of our management. Our technology is being developed and refined by a small number of technical consultants. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to retain and attract the services of these and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more members of our management team or our technical consultants could hinder our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our growth strategies. Finding suitable replacements could be difficult, and competition for such personnel of similar experience is intense. We do not carry key person insurance for our officers. 

Overseas development of our business is subject to international risks, which could adversely affect our ability to license profitable overseas plants. 

We believe a significant portion of the growth opportunity for our business lies outside the United States. Doing business in foreign countries may expose us to many risks that are not present domestically. We lack significant experience in dealing with such risks, including political, military, privatization, technology piracy, currency exchange and repatriation risks, and higher credit risks associated with customers. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to enforce legal obligations in foreign countries, and we may be at a disadvantage in any legal proceeding within the local jurisdiction. Local laws may also limit our ability to hold a majority interest in the projects that we develop. The Company has yet to establish any representation offices outside the United States. 

We do not know if coal processed using our technology is commercially viable. 

We do not yet know whether coal processed using our technology can be produced and sold on a commercial basis in a cost effective manner after taking into account the cost of the feedstock, processing costs, license and royalty fees and the costs of transportation. Because we have not experienced any full scale commercial operations, we have not yet developed a guaranteed efficient cost structure. Initial indications show commercial viability. We are currently using the estimates for anticipated pricing and costs, as well as the qualities of the coal processed in the laboratory and our test facility at AES setting to make such estimates. We may experience technical problems that could make the processed coal more expensive than anticipated. Failure to address both known and unforeseen technical challenges may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Initial indications based on actual test results show a positive impact on the quality of the processed coal and based on current prices appear economically attractive.

We have experienced large net losses, have little liquidity and need to obtain funds for operations or we may not be able to continue. 

We have incurred net losses since inception. The net losses to date include large non-cash expenses recorded for share-based compensation for consultants and officer compensation. However, in addition to the non-cash expenses, we had other operating expenses, funded in large part through loans from existing shareholders. In order to meet our current operating budget and anticipated contractual obligations, we estimate that we will need an additional 5,000,000 for 2023 based on our current contractual obligations. At December 31, 2022, we had no cash and total liabilities of 31,482,738. If we cannot obtain adequate financing from new funding sources, we will be unable to continue operations or meet our contractual obligations. 

Our use of equity as an alternative to cash compensation may cause excessive dilution for our current shareholders. 

Due to shortage of operating funds and low liquidity, we have issued shares as compensation for services, including board and officer compensation as well as compensation for outside consultants and other services. This form of compensation has enabled us to obtain services that would not otherwise have been available to us but it has resulted in dilution to our shareholders. Unless we are able to obtain adequate financing in the immediate future, we may be forced to continue to obtain services through the issuance of shares and warrants, resulting in additional dilution to shareholders and potentially adversely affecting any return on investment. 

Due to the uncertain commercial acceptance of coal processed using our technology we may not be able to realize significant licensing revenues. 

While we strongly believe that a commercial market is developing both domestically and internationally for cleaner coal products such as coal processed using our technology, we may face the following risks due to the developing market for cleaner coal technology: 

- limited pricing information; 

- changes in the price differential between low- and high-BTU coal; 

- unknown costs and methods of transportation to bring processed coal to market; 

- alternative fuel supplies available at a lower price; 

- the cost and availability of emissions-reducing equipment or competing technologies; failure of governments to implement and enforce new environmental standards; and 

- a decline in energy prices which could make processed coal less price competitive. 

If we are unable to develop markets for our processed coal, our ability to generate revenues and profits will be negatively impacted. 

If we are unable to successfully construct and commercialize production plants, our ability to generate profits from our technology will be impaired. 

Our future success depends on our ability to secure partners to locate, develop and construct future commercial production plants and operate them at a profit. A number of different variables, risks and uncertainties affect such commercialization including: 

- the complex, lengthy and costly regulatory permit and approval process; 

- potential local opposition to development of projects, which can increase cost and delay timelines; 

- increases in construction costs such as for contractors, workers and raw materials; 

- transportation costs and availability of transportation; 

- the inability to acquire adequate amounts of low rank feedstock coal at forecasted prices to meet projected goals; 

- availability of suitable consumers of chemical by-product produced by our process; 

- engineering, operational and technical difficulties; and 

- possible price fluctuations of low-Btu coal which could impact profitability. 

If we are unable to successfully address these risks, our results from operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.

Future changes in the law may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services. 

A significant factor in expanding the potential U.S. market for coal processed using our technology is the numerous federal, state and local environmental regulations, which provide various air emission requirements for power generating facilities and industrial coal users. The Trump Administration revoked a number of regulations and restrictions which had an adverse impact on the market for our products and services, however, under the current Biden Administration it remains unclear what regulations will be re-imposed. 

Covid-19 had a negative impact on our funding ability through 2022. There is no assurance that future funding requirements will not be impacted by the continuation of this pandemic.

Overview 

Over the past decade, Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. has developed processes that address what we believe are the key technology priorities of the global coal industry. We currently have three processes in our intellectual property portfolio: 

The original process, called Pristine, is designed to remove moisture and volatile matter, rendering a high-efficiency, cleaner thermal coal. The process has been tested successfully on bituminous and subbituminous coals, and lignite from various parts of the United States and from numerous countries around the world. 

Our second process, called Pristine-M, is a low-cost coal dehydration technology. In tests, this process has succeeded in drying coal economically and stabilizing it using volatile matter released by the feed coal. Construction of our coal testing plant was completed in December 2015 and was successfully tested through April 2016 at AES Coal Power Utility in Oklahoma. Additional tests commenced and were completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. This test facility has been moved from AES to Wyoming where reassembly has commenced and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of the reassembly. Changes identified to the process by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractors will be included in the reassembly and it is expected to provide a higher quality end product with a lower capital cost for a commercial unit. The reassembly is expected to be completed no later than Q3 2023. 

Our third process, called Pristine-SA, is designed to eliminate 100 of the volatile matter in the feed coal and to achieve stable combustion by co-firing it with biomass or natural gas. The process is expected to produce a cleaner fuel that eliminates the need for emissions scrubbers and the corollary production of toxic coal ash. We anticipate that treated coal that is co-fired with other energy resources will burn as clean as natural gas. 

Anticipated Benefits of the Technology: 

Reduction of undesired emissions and greenhouse gases through the removal of compounds that are not required for combustion in conventional boilers. 

Cost savings and environmental impact reduction. Our pre-combustion solution is expected to be significantly less expensive than post-combustion solutions such as emissions scrubbers. Not only are the latter prohibitively expensive, they produce coal ash containing the scrubbed compounds, which is dumped in toxic waste disposal sites where it may pose continuing environmental risk. Coal treated using our processes may eliminate the need for post-combustion emissions scrubbers and the resulting toxic ash. By beneficiating the coal it requires less coal to be consumed to achieve the same energy output. This will save on transportation and handling costs. 

Potential use of compounds removed from treated coal. Volatile matter captured in the Pristine process is removed in the form of hydrocarbon liquids that we believe will be easily blended with crude oil or used as feedstock for various products. For example, sulfur, which can be removed using the Pristine process, is a basic feedstock for fertilizer. The harvesting of hydrocarbon liquids from abundant, cheaper coal is a potentially lucrative side benefit of our processes. All coal by-products including Rare Earth Minerals extraction will be tested in the second-generation facility.

Successful testing of the Pristine M process resulted in an increase in BTU of the processed coal and a reduction in moisture content making it less expensive to transport (as moisture has been removed) with the end product being a dust free stabilized enhanced coal which we believe will address the issue of coal dust pollution during transportation. 

Energy Independence. To the extent that volatile matter is removed from coal, coal s use as an energy resource is greatly improved, enabling coal-rich countries to move towards energy independence owing to coal s greater abundance. Extraction of by-products including Rare Earth Minerals is also expected to provide coal derivative product independence. 

Development Status: 

Pristine process. Pristine process successfully lab tested on small scale and through advanced computer modeling. As at November, 2020, various aspects of the Pristine process were successfully tested at our test facility at the AES coal Power plant in Oklahoma as part of the overall testing of Pristine M. The second-generation facility in Wyoming is expected to perform a more detailed testing of the Pristine process. The build out and delivery of the Rotary Kiln will enable the test facility to reach significantly higher temperatures to test with more accuracy the Pristine process. 

Pristine-M. Testing of the Pristine M process on Powder River Basin coal at the AES facility in Oklahoma was completed in December 2017. The Pristine M process was successfully tested and the process, engineering and science were independently proven. The test facility was moved from the AES location to Wyoming where reassembly commenced in Q4 2019 and testing of international coal is expected upon completion of reassembly. The reassembly was delayed due to the pandemic but it is expected to be completed in Q3 2023. Over several months in 2018 and early 2019 the University of Wyoming independently validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory. By coating the exterior of the coal during the stabilization period with heavy hydrocarbons the process produces dust free stabilized coal for transportation. 

Pristine-SA process. Pristine SA process analysis is at a very early stage. Further research and development is expected using the test facility at its permanent location in Wyoming. The introduction of the Rotary Kiln and the higher temperatures it can achieve will enable a more accurate testing protocol for this process. 

Business Outlook 

Wyoming New Power, a related party company, has agreed to sign a two million ton per annum license agreement to use Pristine M at a location in Wyoming. They have paid a non-refundable 100,000 deposit on the license agreement. The definitive license agreement is expected to be signed following the receipt of commercial design which will incorporate the suggested changes proposed by the University of Wyoming and our EPC contractor. Wyoming New Power is a Related Party because it is controlled by a party that also controls the entity, which is the major lender and significant stockholder of the Company. 

Jindal Steel Power is expected to send though their coal for sampling immediately following the plants re-assembly. The bespoke commercial facility design is expected after the testing. 

			 In Q2, 2019 the Company signed a non binding MOU with Universitas Indonesia in a combined effort to assess the impact of our technology on Indonesian Coal both from a coal beneficiation perspective and also coal by-products. 

			 The second-generation test facility will have the capability of producing Char. There is local Wyoming demand for this product that the company expects to sell. 

The Company entered into a partnership with the University of Wyoming with the sole focus of using our suite of technologies to increase the use of and value of Wyoming Powder River Basin coal. Primary focus is on utilizing our technology to extract valuable derivative products from coal. Changes to the process have been identified by the University and the company EPC engineers and will be incorporated in the reassembly of the facility in Wyoming. The University confirmed in Q2, 2019 that they had successfully validated the Pristine M process in their laboratory and as a result entered into an agreement with the Company. The agreement between the University and the Company is for the reassembly of the second generation test facility. The University will advance to the EPC contractor on a two to one basis. As of the date of this filing the University has advanced a total of approx. 1,300,000 directly to the manufacturer of the Rotary Kiln. The company has booked a payable to the University of Wyoming of 1,000,000 and it will be part of a co-share use of the Kiln going forward. The kiln and all its relevant control panels was delivered to our site at Gillette, Wyoming in June 2020.

The Company has been engaged with AusTrade (The Australian Trade and Investment Commission) and through that relationship has partnered with three separate universities in Australia. Like the University of Wyoming these Universities have a focus on their local coal both from a beneficiation perspective and also extracting derivative by products from coal using our technology. The Company received full Australian patents in Q2, 2019 so the company plans to move forward with this relationship in Q3, 2023 following the assembly of the second-generation test facility. 

The Company continues in discussions with the Minister for Coal in India and a number of the Energy governmental bodies in India. Coal samples are expected to be sent for testing once the Second Generation Test Facility is assembled which is expected in Q3, 2023 but subject to potential delays due to the current pandemic. 

Meetings occurred in Q2, 2019 with the US DOE, DOD and Wyoming State Representatives to further our technology to benefit US coal. These discussions continue through April 2023. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we had two full-time executives. President and CEO Robin Eves, Chief Operations Officer and Aiden Neary, Chief Financial Officer have written employment agreements. Messrs. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors. 

Factors Affecting Results of Operations 

Our operating expenses include the following: 

Consulting expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for technology development and design and engineering services; 

General and administrative expenses, which consist primarily of salaries, commissions and related benefits paid to our employees, as well as office and travel expenses; 

Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of equipment and materials used in the development and testing of our technology; and 

Legal and professional expenses, which consist primarily of amounts paid for patent protections, audit, disclosure, and reporting services. 

Results of Operations 

The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. We have generated limited revenues from inception to date. We anticipate that we may not receive any significant revenues from operations until we begin to receive royalty revenues from our coal testing plant which we estimate will be approximately 12 months after the successful signing of a commercial agreement anticipated in quarter three of fiscal 2023. We are also in preliminary discussions with companies, business groups, consortiums in the USA and Asia to license our technology, which, if successful, could realize limited short-term revenue opportunities from the signing of technology licensing agreements. 

For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

We had no direct revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we received 100,000 as a non- refundable deposit on a two million ton license agreement from Wyoming New Power, a related party. The definitive license agreement is expected to be completed in 2020 following the assembly of the second generation test facility. In the year ended December 31, 2012, we have received an initial license fee of 375,000 from Jindal paid pursuant to the signing of our coal testing plant construction contract. The balance of 375,000 will be due upon the successful testing of Jindal coal in our second generation test facility in Wyoming. We do not anticipate any significant royalty fees for approximately 12-18 months thereafter. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 1,234,896 compared to 3,583,151 for the prior year. The 2,348,255 decrease is mainly due to a 2,350,254 decrease in general and administrative expenses and a 586 decrease in research and development expenses, partially offset by a 2,585 decrease in gains on forgiveness of accounts payable.

Other Income and Expenses 

Total other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 2,027,457, compared to 1,902,178 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other expenses consists of 1,497,279 in interest expense on convertible debt and related amortization of debt discounts and 530,178 in fair value losses as a result of conversion options on convertible debt. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized 2,052,722 in interest expense, 600 in debt default and standstill expenses related to convertible notes payable and 151,144 in fair value gains as a result of conversion options on convertible debt. 

Net Income/Loss 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of 3,262,353, compared to a net loss of 5,485,329 for the year ended December 31, 2021. As discussed above, the net losses for 2022 and 2021 are due to the 1,234,896 and 3,583,151 in operating expenses and 2,027,457 and 1,902,178 in other expenses, respectively. 

We anticipate losses from operations will increase during the next twelve months due to anticipated increased payroll expenses as we add necessary staff and increases in legal and accounting expenses associated with maintaining a reporting company. We expect that we will continue to have net losses from operations for several years until revenues from operating facilities become sufficient to offset operating expenses, unless we are successful in the sale of licenses for our technology. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have generated minimal revenues since inception. We have obtained cash for operating expenses through advances and/or loans from affiliates and stockholders, the sale of common stock, the issuance of loans and convertible debentures converted or convertible to common stock and the receipt of 375,000 in license fees from Jindal as described above. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we used 422,100 and 636,121 in cash from operations, mainly due to the net losses discussed above, net of non-cash operating expenses of 584,030 and 513,671 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our primary uses of funds in operations were payments made to our consultants and employees, legal and professional costs as well as travel and office expenses. 

Net Cash Provided By Investing Activities. 

We had no cash flows from investing activities in 2022 and 2021. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities . 

Net cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled 420,338 and 633,680, respectively. We received 430,736 and 625,080 in cash from the issuance of notes payable to related parties and 0 and 18,600 in cash from the issuance of convertible debt from related parties during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We repaid 10,400 and 10,000 on notes payable to related parties during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Cash Position and Outstanding Indebtedness. 

Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 31,482,738 and 28,577,028, respectively, which consists of 31,464,138 and 28,483,101 of current liabilities and 18,600 and 93,927 of long-term debt, respectively. Current liabilities consist primarily of accounts payable, accounts payable to related parties, short-term debt, related party convertible debt and accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2022 we had no current assets, at December 31, 2021, our current assets was cash totaling 1,762. Our working capital deficit at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 31,464,138 and 28,481,339, respectively. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we have two full-time executives, President and CEO Robin Eves and Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer Aiden Neary, who have written employment agreements. Mr. Eves and Neary received no compensation for their participation on the Board of Directors.

Mr. Eves receives an annual salary of 525,000. Mr. Neary receives an annual salary of 500,000. This contract was automatically renewed under the same terms for another two years. 

The terms of the agreements described above were negotiated by and between the individuals and our Board of Directors based on the qualifications and requirements of each individual and the needs of the company. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

We secured a permanent location in Gillette, Wyoming for our test facility. The term of the lease is three years commencing June 2021 and calls for rent of 36,000, prepaid. We are currently negotiating an additional three year lease under the same terms and conditions. 

We lease office space in New York, NY on a month to month basis, at a monthly rate of 200 per month. 

Our engineering consultants has tentatively estimated construction costs for each one million short ton coal complete cleaning facility of approximately 250 million (excluding land costs) or costs and for a similar size Pristine-M-only facility of approximately 30-35 million (excluding land costs). All intellectual property rights associated with new art developed by our engineering consultants remain our property. 

We are also actively pursuing technology license and royalty agreements in order to begin construction of other facilities without incurring the capital costs associated with the construction of future plants. 

In November 2015, we entered into a month to month agreement with South of the Rose communication to manage our Investor Relations needs and manage social media requirements. 

Construction of the coal testing plant was completed in 2015 and testing commenced in December 2015 at the AES Coal Power Utility in Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid 11,250,224 in development costs. The facility was moved to Wyoming in the first quarter of 2019. We anticipate that there will be an additional cost of approximately 4 million to acquire the additional parts for the second generation test facility and for its assembly. 

Based on our current operational costs and including the capital requirements for our project deployments, we estimate that we will need a total of approximately 5,000,000 to fund the Company for the fiscal year 2023 for plant re-assembly and operating costs of an additional 4,000,000 to continue for the following fiscal year (2024) or until an initial commercial plant is operational. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not and do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on our investments but do not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to our financial condition or results of operations. We invest primarily in United States Treasury instruments with short-term (less than one year) maturities. The carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities. Under our current policies, we do not use derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates or commodity prices.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

There have been no changes in our independent accountants, MaloneBailey, LLP, or disagreements with them on matters of accounting or financial disclosure. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of December 31, 2022 we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to our limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of our published financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and, accordingly, include amounts based on judgments and estimates made by management. Management also prepared the other information included in the annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial statements. The system includes but is not limited to: 

- a documented organizational structure and division of responsibility; 

- established policies and procedures to foster a strong ethical climate which is communicated throughout the Company; 

- regular reviews of our financial statements by qualified individuals; and 

- the careful selection, training and development of our employees and personnel. 

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Also, the effectiveness of an internal control system may change over time. We have implemented a system of internal control that was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. 

Management has assessed our internal control system in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based upon these criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022 our system of internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to material weaknesses that were identified. The material weaknesses are caused by our limited internal resources and limited personnel. We presently have only two officers. The material weaknesses include 1.) no segregation of duties within the Company, 2.) there is no management oversight or multiple levels of supervision and review, no control documentation being produced, no one to review control documentation if it was being produced, 3.) a lack of expertise in the application of generally accepted accounting principles in regard to the accounting and reporting of our debt transactions. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in disclosure controls and procedures that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our disclosure controls and procedures. We do not expect to implement any changes to our disclosure controls and procedures until there is a significant change in our operations or capital resources. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for smaller reporting companies that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Prior to that time, from 1987 to 1990, Mr. Eves served as Vice-President and global head of products trading, and from 1976 to 1987, worked in various positions with Cargill. 

We believe that Mr. Eves qualifications to serve on the Board of Directors include his extensive background in all aspects of the global energy business, including experience in crude and refined products for power production, including gas and coal, as well as related emissions controls. 

Aiden Neary was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company on November 26, 2013 and Chief Operating Officer in July 2015. In January 2016 Mr. Neary was appointed to the Board of Directors.

We believe that Mr. Neary s qualifications to serve on the Board of Directors include his over 15 years of professional experience working in Investment Banking and his over two years of working with Clean Coal Technologies Inc.

Table of Contents 

We believe that Mr. Shreve s qualifications to serve on the Board of Directors include his strong legal and business connections across Asia and in particular in Indonesia where he currently resides. 

All directors will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders (currently expected to be held in the second quarter of 2022) and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. There are no agreements with respect to the election of directors. Vacancies on the Board of Directors during the year may be filled by the majority vote of the directors in office at the time of the vacancy without action by the stockholders. 

Board Committees 

At this filing date, we have an audit committee, but no compensation committee or nominating committee. Our full Board currently performs the duties and responsibilities of such committees. Due to the size of the Company and due to the small number of directors that we had for 2022, we believed it was appropriate for the full Board to handle the responsibilities of these committees. It is our intention through 2023 as our Board increases in size, to introduce a number of committees. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We created an Audit Committee in December 2017 currently comprising of one independent board of director member, Thomas Shreve, and two internal board of director members Aiden Neary and Robin Eves. 

Code of Conduct 

On February 11, 2013, the board of directors approved a code of business conduct and ethics, filed as an exhibit to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K on February 14, 2013. 

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 

The Board of Directors has risk oversight responsibility for the Company and administers this responsibility directly. The Board of Directors oversees our risk management process through regular discussions of our risks with senior management both during and outside of regularly scheduled Board of Directors meetings. In addition, the Board of Directors administers our risk management process with respect to risks relating to our accounting and financial controls. 

Our Board of Directors has no policy with regard to the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and believes, given the size of our company, no such formal policy is necessary at this time. 

Director Independence 

Our Board is not subject to any independence requirements. However, our Board has reviewed the independence of its directors under the requirements set forth by the NASDAQ Stock Market. Messrs. Eves and Neary are officers of the Company and therefore not deemed independent directors. Mr. Shreve is deemed to be an independent director. 

Meetings of our Board of Directors 

Our Board of Directors held 4 meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (including meetings conducted by telephone conferencing). No director attended less than 75 of all board meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. All current Board members and all nominees for election to the Board of Directors are encouraged to attend our annual meetings of stockholders, either in person or by teleconference. 

Nomination of Director Candidates 

We receive suggestions for potential director nominees from many sources, including members of the Board, advisors, and stockholders. Any such nominations, together with appropriate biographical information, should be submitted to the Chairperson of the Board in the manner discussed below. Any candidates submitted by a stockholder or stockholder group are reviewed and considered in the same manner as all other candidates. 

41

Table of Contents 

Qualifications for consideration as a Board nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a complement to the existing board composition. However, minimum qualifications include high level leadership experience in business activities, breadth of knowledge about issues affecting the Company, experience on other boards of directors, preferably public company boards, and time available for meetings and consultation on Company matters. Our Board does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates, but seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the background, skills and expertise to make a significant contribution to the Board, to the Company and our stockholders. Candidates whose evaluations are favorable are then chosen by the full Board. The full Board selects and recommends candidates for nomination as directors for stockholders to consider and vote upon at the annual meeting. 

Stockholder Communications 

Stockholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors or with a specific director may send a letter to our corporate secretary at Clean Coal Technologies, Inc., 295 Madison Avenue (12th Floor), New York, NY 10017, and should be marked to the attention of the appropriate director or directors. Our secretary will circulate the communications (other than commercial solicitations) to the appropriate director or directors. Communications marked Confidential will be forwarded unopened. 

Directors Compensation 

In 2022, all meetings were via telephone conference. The Board plans one regularly scheduled meeting each fiscal quarter and may schedule additional meetings as necessary. For fiscal 2021 and 2022, Mr. Shreve will receive annual compensation as a director of 25,000 which will be paid only upon available cash flow. 

All of our present non-employee directors, have other employment or sources of income and will routinely devote only such time to the Company necessary to maintain its viability. It is estimated that each non-employee director will devote at least 2 days per month to the Company s corporate activities. We incurred 25,000 in director fees for the outside director during the years 2021 and 2022 

Stock Ownership Requirements 

The Board of Directors has encouraged its members to acquire and maintain stock in the Company to link the interests of such persons to the stockholders. However, the Board of Directors has not established stock ownership guidelines for members of the Board of Directors or the executive officers. 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

At this time, we do not have a compensation committee or a fully developed compensation policy. We have only two executive officers, our CEO and president, our Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Their employment agreements were negotiated by the board of directors with the terms based on the board s assessment of their qualifications and requirements. 

We anticipate establishing a compensation committee sometime in the next 12 months. The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes prospectively the expected duties, responsibilities and role of our future Compensation Committee as well as the material elements of our planned compensation for our future executive officers. The information below provides the description of compensation policies that we intend to make applicable to executive officers and other highly compensated individuals under employment and/or consulting arrangements in the future. 

Planned Objectives of Our Compensation Program 

The primary objective of our compensation program, including our executive compensation program, will be to maintain a compensation program that will fairly compensate our executives and employees, attract and retain qualified executives and employees who are able to contribute to our long term success, encourage performance consistent with clearly defined corporate goals and align our executives long term interests with those of our stockholders. To that end, our future compensation practices will be intended to: 

1. Tie total compensation to the Company s performance and individual performance in achieving financial and non-financial objectives; and 

2. Align senior management s interests with stockholders interests through long term equity incentive compensation. 

42

Table of Contents 

Expected Role of the Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee, once formed, will determine the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, and our other executive officers. In addition, the Compensation Committee will be responsible for adopting, reviewing and administering our compensation policies and programs, including any cash bonus incentive plan or equity incentive plan that we may adopt. We anticipate that our Compensation Committee will adhere to a compensation philosophy that (i) seeks to attract and retain qualified executives who will add to the long term success of the Company, (ii) promotes the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, and (iii) compensates executives commensurate with each executive s level of performance, level of responsibility and overall contribution to the success of the Company. 

In determining the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers, the Compensation Committee expects to consider the financial condition and operational performance of the Company during the prior year. In determining the compensation for executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee plans to consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. 

The Compensation Committee will review the compensation practices of other companies, based in part on market survey data and other statistical data relating to executive compensation obtained through industry publications and other sources. The Compensation Committee does not intend to benchmark the Company s compensation program directly with other publicly traded companies or other companies with which we may compete for potential executives since some of these competitors are privately held companies for which executive compensation information may not be available. However, the Compensation Committee intends to compare our executive compensation program as a whole with the programs of other companies for which survey data is available, and will also compare the pay of individual executives if the jobs are sufficiently similar to make the comparison meaningful. The Compensation Committee plans to use such survey data primarily to ensure that our executive compensation program as a whole will be competitive. 

Components of Future Executive Compensation 

We anticipate that our future executive employment agreements will provide that employees will be compensated by salary and bonus, with bonuses potentially including cash and equity components. The specific elements of the future compensation program are not determined but will most likely include base salary, an annual cash performance bonus and long-term equity incentives. Our compensation program will be designed to provide our executives with incentives to achieve our short and long-term performance goals and to pay competitive base salaries. Each executive officer s current and prior compensation will be considered in setting future compensation. 

In addition, we expect employment agreements with our executive officers to provide for other benefits, including potential payments upon termination of employment. Once established, the compensation committee will consider all of the above components in determining the exact makeup of the total executive compensation package as well as the factors to be applied in establishing each component. 

Perquisites and Other Benefits 

At this time, we do not expect to provide perquisites or personal benefits to future executive officers, other than the payment of health insurance premiums and payment of life insurance premiums. 

Employment Agreements 

We signed two year employment agreements effective July 1, 2020, with Robin Eves, as Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mr. Neary as COO/CFO. Mr. Eves will receive an annual salary of 525,000 and Mr. Neary 500,000. Each officer was granted a signing bonus of 7,500 shares of the Company s restricted common stock upon execution of the agreements. These contracts were automatically renewed for an additional two years. 

The above employment agreements include provisions for participation in employee benefit programs if the Company adopts such programs during the term of the agreements. The agreements also include certain anti-takeover provisions that would require payment of annual salary as well as immediate vesting of all equity compensation if an entity acquiring the Company did not offer comparable positions to each officer. 

Neither Mr. Eves, nor Mr. Neary is compensated for their contributions to the Board of Directors. 

43

Table of Contents 

We have not entered into employment agreements with any other officers, directors, or any other persons but may do so during the current fiscal year as we expand operations. 

Other Key Employees and Consultants 

As at December 31, 2022 we have no other employees in the company. 

Employee Benefits 

When we have adequate financing, we intend to offer employee health insurance benefits coverage to provide our workforce with a reasonable level of financial support in the event of illness or injury. It is our intention to offer health insurance benefits to all full time employees, including executive officers. 

Accounting Matters 

We have adopted the provisions of ACS 718 Compensation Stock Compensation which requires the fair value of options to be recorded as compensation cost in the consolidated financial statements. Options in our compensation packages result in additional compensation costs being recognized. 

Stock Ownership Requirements 

The Board of Directors has encouraged its members to acquire and maintain stock in the Company to link the interests of such persons to the stockholders. However, the Board of Directors has not established stock ownership guidelines for members of the Board of Directors or the executive officers. 

The Company has not adopted any other bonus, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan. 

The following table sets forth, for the last two years, the dollar value of all cash and non-cash compensation earned by the Company s named executive officers.

The license agreement is for two million tons per annum. The remainder of the license fee will be due upon the signing of a definitive license agreement expected in 2023. Wyoming New Power is a related party because it is controlled by an entity that has a significant interest in Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. 

Director Independence 

Our Board is not subject to any independence requirements. However, our Board has reviewed the independence of its directors under the requirements set forth by the NASDAQ Stock Market. Messrs.
