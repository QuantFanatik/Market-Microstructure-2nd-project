Penny Stock Rules 

 Trading
 in Stemtech s Common Stock is subject to the penny stock rules. The Securities
 and Exchange Commission SEC has adopted regulations that generally define
 a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share,
 subject to certain exceptions. 

These rules require that any broker-dealer who
recommends Stemtech s Common Stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the sale, make
a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction.
Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure
schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers
must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities
they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions
in Stemtech s securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of Stemtech s securities. The application
of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell Stemtech s securities. 

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 

The Company is a smaller reporting company as
defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion
contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Stemtech s actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not
limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. Stemtech s audited financial statements are stated in United
States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Company Overview 

Stemtech Corporation was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada, U.S. on September 4, 2009. Our registration statement on Form S-1 was filed with the SEC was declared effective
on May 15, 2013. On August 19, 2021, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Stemtech Corporation by which the Company acquired
one hundred percent of the shares of STEMTECH CORPORATION in exchange for the issuance of 37,060,000 shares of the Company, approximately
85 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. 

Stemtech has pioneered and patented a whole new category of dietary supplements. Stemtech s advanced Stem Cell Nutrition formulations are one-of-a-kind natural products designed to help support the three most important aspects of stem cell physiology: 1) Releasing more stem cells; 2) their circulation in the blood; and 3) Migration into tissues, where they can perform their daily function of renewal and rejuvenation for optimal health. We actually harness the incredible power of adult stem cells. How does this work? Adult stem cells are released from your bone marrow into the bloodstream, they then Circulate in the bloodstream and flow to the tissues most in need. As they arrive, the adult stem cells migrate into the tissues, reproduce and become new, healthy cells of those tissues. This process takes place every single day, even without tissue damage, as part of the natural renewal system of the body. It is important to understand that Stemtech s products do not contain stem cells. They are composed of natural botanicals and other ingredients that have been clinically documented to support the performance of your own adult stem cells. Stemtech also offers our all-natural OraStem toothpaste, which is a tooth whitener, breath freshener, anti-microbial, stem cell attracting and promotes good gum health. In December 2022, our new Cellect One Rapid Renew Stem Cell Peptide Night Cream. Cellect One is a Stemtech proprietary formula containing an FDA patented ingredient, Red Oak Bark, which enables deep penetration to promote good skin health. 

While sales of products obviously create the cash flow, our real business model is not just sales , but lateral penetration. We do this through our IBPs - Independent Business Partner Sales Forces, and we invest much energy in growing our IBPs. Post public listing and funding, Stemtech is projecting the addition of 30,000 new independent business partner reps over the next 12 to 24 months, adding to the existing IBPs. With an enhanced compensation plan, IBPs will be even more incentivized to build their network, attracting additional industry leaders. IBPs are a testimonial to our product and business model, lowering our customer acquisition costs. 

We are now reinstituting contests, travel incentives, cruises, other trips, Business Academies for Training, regional conferences, our Annual Convention with new product launches. Our IBPs offer highly flexible yet steady income which is most adapted to todays Laptop Cellphone Lifestyle , with structured and organized weekly Corporate training calls, a personalized website, back office tracking, oversight and management Tools, Reports, Training Materials and Social Sharing. Stemtech also launched the Stemtech AdvanceOffice Mobile App, based on the Verb Technology platform in September 2022, improving communication, sharing of information, training videos and other content for recruiting, on-boarding, customer retention and measuring key performance indicators for the IBP business. 

Stemtech launched a new marketing program in January 2022, with sales continuing to come in from returning consumers who believe in the quality products. Until September 2021, the Company had operated on an extremely tight budget, with inadequate working capital and difficulties fulfilling orders. Since the cash infusions noted in Financing infra, the company now has the resources to contact and re-engage the over 200,000 former distributors. With this new cash infusion, the Company has engaged experienced marketing and social media professionals to initiate new marketing strategies which are expected to bring increased activity. Moreover, we are now better positioned to absorb significant new clientele as the company has directed significant cash towards our inventory, and we now have enough inventory on hand to fulfill over 3 million dollars worth of new orders, an inventory level we have not had since going into bankruptcy in 2017. Management conservatively believes that given the cash on hand and working expenditures as describe above, we can reinvigorate sales to be more consistent with the company s previous revenue historically, as we were recognized 4 times in the Inc 5000 Magazine s list of fastest growing companies. 

Below this IBP level, we have our DTC (Direct To Consumer) network marketing Distribution model. This integrative model allows us an immediate global presence and ability to operate in multiple countries on any continent. We are uniquely positioned in this post pandemic economy beset by supply chain issues, as this method requires no up-front or required buy-in of inventory, with monthly shipments available for known recurring sales. This platform has us now operating at the intersection of the ecommerce economy, social economy and gig economy.

The Company has been making great strides the
past year, having filed our Orastem trademark registration in Mexico as noted in our press release of August 23, 2022.
In addition, Stemtech filed our new stemceuticals trademark registration. We also have been fortunate to have Dr. Bankole
Johnson join our Life Sciences Advisory Board in September, as well as the introduction of a whole new line of stem cell skin care products.
Life Factor Research brings their expertise in research, development and product formulations enabling the Company to now organically
develop whole new lines of Stemceuticals. This new arrangement enables Stemtech to offer more new, cutting-edge products to an ever-growing
market interested in improved health and quality of life.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

Emerging Growth Company - We are an emerging growth
company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging
growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least 1.07 billion; (ii)
the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than
 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which means the market value of our common stock that is held
by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30. 

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from: 

Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which require companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation; 

The requirement to provide, in any registration statement, periodic report or other report to be filed with the SEC certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement; 

Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies; 

The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and 

Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB , rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or an expanded auditor report, and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted unless the Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public. 

We have elected to use the extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. 

We are also a smaller reporting company as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide selected financial data pursuant to
Item 301 of Regulation S-K, nor are we required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. We are also permitted to provide certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K.

statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. 

Results of Operations 

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect
we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among
other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the
Year Ended December 31, 2021. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
net sales were 4,559,399 and 4,321,245, respectively. The increase of 238,154 is primarily due to slight increases in the overall sales
of the subsidiaries due to the increase in IBPs in 2022. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
our total operating expenses were 8,418,761 and 6,508,356, respectively. The increase of 1,910,405 is primarily attributable to an
increase in stock compensation granted to vendors and officers in 2022. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
total non-operating expenses were 3,513,830 and 3,900,838, respectively, resulting in an increase of 387,008. The difference is primarily
due to the gain on extinguishment of debt of 3,799,356 in 2022, the decrease in interest expense of 4,232,358, partially offset by the
changes in fair value of derivative liabilities from a gain of 4,553,372 at December 31, 2021 to a loss of 3,223,271 at December 31,
2022 in connection with the note payable issued in September 2021. 

Our net loss for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, was 8,632,828 and 7,111,109, respectively. The increase in net loss was caused by the factors described above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In spite of increasing revenues, we are not yet
profitable, and we cannot provide any assurance of when we will be profitable. We incurred a net loss of 8,632,828 and 7,111,109 for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we met our short-term liquidity requirements
from our existing cash reserves and proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of 611,266, net proceeds from financing arrangements
of 214,249 and stock issued for cash of 100,002. 

As of December 31, 2022, our current assets were
 612,370 compared to 1,600,039 in current assets at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, our current liabilities were 7,415,791
compared to 9,387,038 at December 31, 2021. Current liabilities at December 31, 2022 were comprised of 3,396,543 of accounts payable
and accrued expenses, 2,717,633 of derivative liabilities, 482,885 in convertible notes, 446,246 of nonconvertible notes payable, 214,249
of factoring liability, 119,065 in current operating lease liabilities and 39,170 in deferred revenues. 

Stockholders deficit decreased from 4,005,446
as of December 31, 2021 to 3,171,918 at December 31, 2022. This change was primarily caused by the issuance of common stock for the conversion
of debt of 828,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

 We have not generated positive cash flows from
operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities were 1,216,948 which is primarily
due the change in working capital accounts. The net loss of 8,632,828 and 3,799,356 gain on extinguishment of debt was offset by 3,223,271
loss from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, 3,996,187 stock based compensation, and 2,428,539 amortization of debt
discount. Adjustments for changes in operating assets and liabilities were due to a decrease in inventories of 278,352, an increase in
deferred revenues of 39,170, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 37,645 and an increase in long term deposits
of 15,627 offset by an decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 683,058 and an increase in accounts receivable of 24,047.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities were 1,914,093. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

We have financed our operations primarily from
either the issuance of our shares of common stock or notes payable. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated 338,734 cash from
financing activities which consists of 611,266 from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, 214,249 proceeds from factoring arrangement
and 100,002 proceeds from issuance of stocks for cash, partially offset by payments on notes payable of 586,783. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, net cash flows provided by financing activities were 2,628,739. 

Plan of Operation and Funding 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of equity securities and debt instruments. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no
lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private
placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating
expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business;
and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and director loans. Thereafter,
we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances
of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Additional financing may not be available
upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to
take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business
operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently
do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of
equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although
no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We
do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this report, we do not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
to investors.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Stemtech Corporation and Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Stemtech Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations since inception and has a significant working capital deficit and
a significant accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the board of directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 1 

Critical Audit Matter Description: 

As discussed in Note 7 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements, the Company had various debt instruments which included conversion features requiring bifurcation and separate accounting.
Management evaluated the required accounting, significant estimates, and judgments around the valuation for these embedded derivatives.
These embedded derivatives were initially measured at fair value and have subsequently been remeasured to fair value at each reporting
period and at settlement. 

There is no current observable market for these
types of features and, as such, the Company determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a Monte Carlo model to measure
the fair value of the bifurcated derivative. As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment and effort was required in performing audit
procedures to evaluate the conclusions of management, as well as the inputs to the Company s Monte Carlo mode. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit: 

Our principal audit procedures performed to address
the critical audit matter included the following: 

We obtained an understanding of the controls and processes surrounding the evaluation, initial measurement,
and revaluation of the bifurcated derivatives. 
 
 We verified the note amount, interest rate, and maturity date to the supporting documentation and debt
agreement, and examined terms and conditions of the note and confirmed the ending balance to the note holder. 
 
 We evaluated management s assessment and the conclusions reached to ensure these instruments were
recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. 
 
 We evaluated the fair value of the bifurcated derivatives that included testing the valuation models and
assumptions utilized by management. We reviewed and tested the fair value model used, significant assumptions, and underlying data used
in the model. 
 
 We considered the adequacy of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements in relation to
convertible debt.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

million 
at December 31, 2022. The Company has funded its activities to date almost exclusively from debt and equity financing. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue to
require substantial funds to implement its new investment acquisition plans. Management s plans in order to meet its operating
cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, preferred stock offerings, and
issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements depends on its ability to execute its business plan,
increase revenue, and reduce expenditures. Such conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern.

Fair Value of the Acquired Assets 

The Company accounted for the acquisitions as
business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed in ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations ASC
805 and ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 ). In accordance with ASC
805 and ASC 820, the Company assigned fair value to the tangible assets acquired, identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed
as of the acquisition dates. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value
of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

The excess purchase price has been recorded as goodwill
in the amount of at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible assets is six to fourteen

 . The effective interest rates of the notes are 10 and mature within one year. In addition, the Company issued 
 shares of common stock in the aggregate for the commitment of resulting in a charge of 
 to debt discount. In 2020, the Company entered into various promissory notes with lenders in the aggregate principal balance of
 
 with effective interest rates between 8 and 10 per annum. Each of these notes was extended until May 31, 2023. The

 of convertible promissory notes to investors. The notes had maturity dates between nine months and three years and have interest
 rates between 8 and 12 per annum. The notes were later extended and not in default. The Company also issued 
 shares of common stock and granted warrants to purchase 
 shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging between 2.685 and 3.00 per share. The value of the common stock and warrants
 were recorded as a discount of the note at fair value. 

During the second quarter of 2022, one of the
 nine-month notes was extended for an additional 60 days, until August 1, 2022. As consideration for the 60-day extension, the Company
 agreed to pay shares of common stock to the note holder, reduce the conversion price of the note, and reprice the associated warrants

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures. 

A. Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Stemtech s principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated
its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) for the period covered by this
annual report as of its fiscal year end, December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, this officer concluded that as of the end of the
period, these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Stemtech in
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including Stemtech s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of December 31 , 2022. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that Stemtech s disclosure controls and procedures
were adequate as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Stemtech files or submits under
the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer
also confirmed that there was no change in Stemtech s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

B. Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over Stemtech s financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing,
using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO ). 

Stemtech s system of internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Based on Stemtech s evaluation, its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Stemtech s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective
as of December 31, 2022 and were subject to material weaknesses. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified
the following material weaknesses in Stemtech s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in the
COSO: 

1. Failing to have an audit committee or other
independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control over financial reporting; and 

2. Failing to have a director that qualifies as
an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

3. Lack of segregation of duties consistent with
control objectives. 

12 

4. Insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and applications of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of Stemtech s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Stemtech s
internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by Stemtech s independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit Stemtech to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

C. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, Stemtech s
internal control over financial reporting was not subject to changes. 

Item 9B. Other Information.

Director independence 

Stemtech s board of directors currently
consists of John W. Meyer our President and COO, Charles S. Arnold, our CEO, John Thatch, Benjamin Kaplan and Darryl V. Green. Pursuant
to Item 407(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, Stemtech s board of directors has adopted the definition of independent
director as set forth in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Manual. In summary, an independent director means a person
other than an executive officer or employee of Stemtech or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of Stemtech s
board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgement in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, and
includes any director who accepted any compensation from Stemtech in excess of 200,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months with
the three past fiscal years. Also, the ownership of Stemtech s stock will not preclude a director from being independent. 

In applying this definition, Stemtech s
board of directors has determined that neither Messrs. Meyer nor Arnold qualifies as an independent director pursuant to
the same rule. 

As of the date of the report, Stemtech did not
maintain a separately designated compensation or nominating committee. 

Stemtech has also adopted this definition for
the independence of the members of its audit committee. John Meyer our COO and Charles Arnold, our CEO are the sole members of Stemtech s
audit committee as a result of being the sole director. Stemtech s board of directors has determined that neither Messrs. Meyer
nor Arnold qualifies independent for purposes of Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Manual, applicable to audit, compensation
and nominating committee members, and is independent for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act. 

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. 

Audit Fees 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the
aggregate fees billed by KR Margetson Ltd., Chartered Professional Accountant for professional services rendered for the audit of our
annual consolidated financial statements were 800 and 6,000. The aggregate fees billed by Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P in 2022
and 2021 were 35,000 and 35,000, respectively, plus any out-of-pocket costs. 

We do not use Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P.
for financial information system design and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a system that aggregates
source data underlying the consolidated financial statements or generates information that is significant to our consolidated financial
statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P. to provide compliance
outsourcing services. 

Effective May 6, 2003, the SEC adopted rules which
require that before Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P. is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service,
the engagement be: 

approved by our board of directors who are capable of analyzing and evaluating financial information; or 

entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the board of directors responsibilities to management. 

The board of directors pre-approves all services
provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before
or after the respective services were rendered.
