stage emerging diversified information and communications technology company specializing in cutting-edge digital transformation services,
including new-media technology; telecommunication and network carrier services; IoT-enabled solutions; and managed ICT, managed cloud
services, data centers and co-location services. 

Founded
in 2016, and based in New York, N.Y., ISI seeks to operate internationally with a global team known for its technological expertise,

mission is to help advance critical milestones in the future of communication technology. 

How

Our
top priorities are to manage and deliver products and services of acquired companies while concurrently extending our current product
and service offerings to meet clients needs. Our core value proposition is designed to offer: 

Convenience
 Our goal will be to provide a comprehensive offering of products and services to meet all of the information and communications
 technology needs of our clients. We will provide semi-annual proposals with a list of recommendations to be implemented within ISI s
 family of companies. 

Cost

 lower prices in a bundle than purchasing individual stand-alone products or services.

Our
Market Opportunity 

We
see our market opportunities as follows: 

Opportunities
in building a high margin business model-open-source platform, software and hardware which offer substantial cost-savings on licenses,
with better security and reliability than many leading closed-source platforms. 

We
intend to target acquisitions in digital telecommunication that are Tier 2 network providers, furthering opportunities with services
delivered over guaranteed access networks, increasing security, quality, and speed: 

By
 migrating future clients who might use legacy technology to more efficient technology, this migration will significantly increase
 rental margins. 

By
 marketing internet hosted telephone platforms to satisfy demand in the global marketplace for telephone systems and services in
 the cloud. 

By
 integrating existing installations into multimedia contact center environment. 

By
 capitalizing on general transposition of IT services not in the cloud, requiring the faster, more robust 

internet
 connectivity that some of the acquisition targets are primed to provide. 

By
 integrating voice services with multimedia contact center applications. 

Our
Corporate Strategy 

The
Company s corporate strategy focuses on executing a two-tier growth strategy: 

a.
Growth by acquiring existing revenue producing companies with at least 10 years of operations in the technology spaces in which they
operate, a critical mass of customers, ownership of key intellectual property assets and that provide critical services to business and
government customers. 

b.
Organic growth by developing product and services in new business segments in horizontal markets for diversification across geographies,
industries, and customers.

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Management s
Discussion and Analysis 

This
section of the Form 10-K includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events
and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend,
project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from our predictions. 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues from our planned business model are anticipated until we have completed
financing the Company. 

We
need to seek capital from resources such as the sale of private placements in the Company s common stock or debt financing, which
may not even be available to the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are an early-stage company with no or
limited operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with such financing and in the case of high-risk
loans be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such
financing. If the company cannot raise additional proceeds via such financing, it may be required to cease business operations. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated a net negative
cash flow of 4,005 as compared to a positive cash flow of 4,005 for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of the date of this Form 10-K,
the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related to maintaining a reporting status. We are
in the process of seeking additional equity financing in the form of private placements and in raising funds from registered securities
to fund our intended business operations. 

3 

Management
believes that if subsequent private placements are successful or we are successful in raising funds from registered securities, we will
generate sales revenue within twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms
or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. 

Results
of Operations 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company was not engaged in continued business and has been primarily involved in early-stage activities. Due to
a lack of funding, we have not implemented our Plan of Operations. 

The
Company has not yet implemented its business model. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. In the event we
do not raise any proceeds, the Company s existing cash will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related to maintaining a reporting
status and to implement its planned business. We had 0 in revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Total
operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 72,857 as compared to total operating expenses for the year ended December
31, 2021 of 54,535, and a net loss for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of 72,857 and 53,648, respectively. The net loss for
the year ended December 31, 2022 is a result of General and Administrative expenses of 1,799, Professional Fees of 5,920, and Compensation
of 65,138. Conversely, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from General and Administrative expenses of 7,910,
Professional Fees of 29,025, Compensation of 17,600, and other income of 887. The increase in expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021
is primarily due to increased stock-based compensation for services rendered by executives, directors, and third parties. 

Off-Balance
sheet arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect or change on the
company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other
contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party, under which the company has (i) any obligation
arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred
to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. 

Plan
of Operations 

On
October 5, 2018, the Company changed its name to Internet Sciences Inc. ISI ). Internet Sciences Inc. ISI 
or the Company ), formerly known as Luxury Trine Digital Media Group Inc., is an early stage emerging diversified information
and communications technology company specializing in cutting-edge digital transformation services, including new-media technology; telecommunication
and network carrier services; IoT-enabled solutions; and managed ICT, managed cloud services, data centers and co-location services. 

ASC
810-10-25-38, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities requires a variable interest entity VIE to be
consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the VIE s expected losses and/or receives a majority of the entity s
expected residual returns as a result of holding variable interests. Trine Digital Broadcasting is a VIE as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38.
As ISI owns 49 of the VIE and the founder (CEO) majority shareholder (a related party) of ISI controls the remaining 51 , ISI has been
determined to be the primary beneficiary of this VIE. The VIE was formed to expand the business of ISI into the United Kingdom. There
are no formal explicit arrangements as of December 31, 2020, that requires ISI to provide financial support to the VIE, although financial
support is. 

We
are unaware of any material risks associated with this VIE. 

ISI
is an information and communications technology company that seeks to become a multi-industry technology-based enterprise primarily through
merger and acquisition of business segments in new media technologies, digital telecommunication, data storage, IoT enabling technologies
and cutting-edge ICT technologies for Data Analytics. 

4 

Through
its planned acquisitions in the United States and the United Kingdom, the Company expects to reach a broad base of existing clients across
Continental Europe, principally in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxemburg. While ISI s primary activities
in the United Kingdom will focus on delivering managed high performance WIFI networks, managed ITC solutions, , its US operations will
sharply focus data centers and co-location services, internet exchange services and on organic growth by launching new business segments
that design commercial intelligent software applications in Business Analytics and Business Intelligence , scalable cloud based platforms
that deliver enterprise solutions as Platform-as -a -Service (PaaS) and infrastructure solutions as Infrastructure-as-a service (IaaS). 

As
a complement to its total products and service offerings across the entire Company landscape and global footprint, ISI seeks to add value
by offering its consulting services with expertise in artificial intelligence, data analytics, supply chain and logistics.

Company s principal place of business is 667 Madison Avenue 5th Floor, New York, NY 10065 

Luxury
Trine TV 

Luxury
Trine TV is an OTT platform with TV software assets owned by Internet Sciences which distributed short form luxury lifestyle information
and entertainment content to diverse consumer segments via smart TV platforms and set top boxes from June 2017 to July 2018. The company
developed 6 proprietary TV applications for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku TV, Samsung, LG and Android TV. 

As
of July 2018, the Company has ceased its broadcasting activities in the US, and it is preparing to relaunch its broadcasting activities
in the UK via Trine Digital Broadcasting Ltd (the VIE ). The Company has chosen to change its strategy by focusing on a
UK audience through connected Free view which is a hybrid of terrestrial TV and OTT. 

5 

Freeview
(terrestrial) is the largest UK broadcasting platform available in 18.3 million UK households (this includes homes that have two or more
platforms i.e., Free view and another platform) and dedicated Free view only homes equate to 11.4 million UK households. See

Trine
Digital Broadcasting LTD. (the VIE 

Trine
Digital Broadcasting Ltd is a UK based broadcasting company that will distribute both short form and long form television content via
a hybrid of terrestrial TV and OTT enabling advertisers to reach critical mass audiences with diverse forms of access to television contents. 

The
VIE s objectives are twofold: 

a.
Develop Software as a Service SaaS broadcast technology products to expand its commercial activities. 

b.
Bring addressable TV to the US once there is a market for HbbTV in the US. Presently there is no market for Hybrid broadcast broadband
TV HbbTV in the US and addressable TV is an opportunity gap that we intend to fill with HbbTV enabling technologies in
the US market. 

Based
upon the growth of the UK media market, our initial focus for Trine Digital Broadcasting Ltd., will be in the UK where we intend to acquire
existing UK based media companies to deploy our strategies which include strategic alliances with UK based companies to balance market
penetration, market development, product development and diversification.

Over-the-top content (OTT) is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a multiple-system
operator (MSO) in the control or distribution of the content. 

Studies 

According
to a 2021 Price Waterhouse Global Entertainment Media Outlook, the UK is forecasted to return to growth this year and continues
to grow over the next four years driven by sectors liberated from Covid restrictions. By 2025, the UK is set to overtake Germany as the
biggest E M market in Western Europe by revenue. Digital advertising is forecast to continue to forge ahead, rising at a CAGR of
almost 8 over the next four years, twice as fast as non-digital. 

UK
 compound annual growth rate to outpace global over the forecast period 

Total
 UK advertising spend to grow at 7 p.a. over the next 5 years as it recovers from the pandemic disruption 

Total
 UK consumer spending on Entertainment Media to grow at 5 p.a. over the next 5 years, driven by continued digital downloads,
 access and consumption 

PwC
 forecasts growth will rebound 9 this year and over the forecast period at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5 outpacing the
 expected growth in E M revenues at a global level. 

6 

By
 2025, the UK s E M sector is expected to be worth 88bn with only the US, China, and Japan worth more globally. 

Latest
 forecasts support optimism about augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) growing to a value of more than 44.7 billion worldwide
 by 2024. 

By
 2025, the UK s E M sector is expected to be worth 88bn with only the US, China, and Japan worth more globally. 

The
 UK is a key driver for these sectors within Europe, which is forecast to hold a 25 share of the global market behind only the US
 and the Asia-Pacific region. 

The implications of these studies suggest that we will benefit from current and future growth in new media by focusing,
identifying, and investing in growing and emerging sectors as we recognize the innovative nature of British enterprises is critical as
the technologies seek new use cases outside of the gaming industry. 

Our
Competition 

Our
competitive landscape is as diverse as the business segments in which we seek to operate. We face competition from some of the largest
and best capitalized companies in the United States and throughout the world and include media conglomerate such as Google, Apple, British
Telecom, Amazon to smaller technology consulting companies such as Critical Future. These and other niche companies have greater name
recognition and financial resources, enabling them to finance acquisition and development opportunities or develop and support their
own operations. They may also be in a position to pay higher prices than we would for the same acquisition opportunities. Consequently,
we may encounter significant competition in our efforts to achieve our internal and external growth objectives. Many of our competitors
have established methods of operation that have been proven over time to be successful.

have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Internet Sciences Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Considerations 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered
recurring losses since inception and has not achieved profitable operations, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE
1 - ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS 

Internet
Sciences Inc. ISI or the Company was originally incorporated as Luxury Trine Digital Media Group, Inc.
in the State of Delaware on May 20, 2016. On October 5, 2018, the Company changed its name to Internet Sciences Inc. 

ISI
is an early-stage emerging diversified information and communications technology company specializing in cutting-edge digital transformation
services, including new-media technology; telecommunication and network carrier services; IoT-enabled solutions; and managed ICT, managed
cloud services, data centers and co-location services. 

Based
in New York, N.Y., ISI seeks to operate internationally with a global team known for its technological expertise, deep industry knowledge,
world-class research and analytical capabilities, and innovative mindset. 

ISI seeks to transform corporations, enterprises, and government entities

excellence. We plan to have our interdisciplinary teams work in close collaboration with clients, helping them to solve their biggest
problems utilizing a user-centric, data-driven approach focusing on creating seamless unified experiences across all digital, communication
and physical touchpoints. 

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America GAAP and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the following subsidiaries: 

Ownership 

Country 
 Interest 
 
 Trine Digital Broadcasting Ltd (TDB) 
 United Kingdom 
 49 
 
 Institute of Technology, Informatics Computer Analytics LLC (IOTICA) 
 USA 
 100 
 
 Analgene Limited (AL) 
 United Kingdom 
 100 

The
Company s functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currency of TDB and AL is the British pound.
On consolidation, the subsidiary translates its assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at
the balance sheet date and translates its revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses arising
on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions are included in other income (expense), while translation gains (losses) are
reported as other comprehensive income (loss). No foreign currency translation or transactions gains or losses were recognized during
the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021 due to the absence of operations in the UK subsidiaries. 

In
the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. 

F- 6 

Variable
Interest Entities 

The
Company holds a 49 noncontrolling interest in Trine Digital Broadcasting Ltd (TDB) as it is solely a party of interest in providing
funding to TDB broadcasting projects. Ownership of the intellectual property assets are to remain with TDB. TDB is deemed to be a variable
interest entity VIE as defined in ASC 810-10-25-38, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. ASC 810
requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the VIE s expected losses and/or receives
a majority of the entity s expected residual returns as a result of holding variable interests. As ISI owns 49 of the VIE and
the founder (CEO) majority shareholder (a related party) of ISI controls the remaining 51 , ISI has been determined to be the primary
beneficiary of this VIE. The VIE was formed to expand the business of ISI into the United Kingdom. There are no formal explicit arrangements
as of December 31, 2022, that require ISI to provide financial support to the VIE, although financial support is implied by the relationship.
There were no assets or liabilities of the VIE as of December 31, 2022. The Company has not provided funding to TDB to date, therefore,
there have been no operations. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates made by management in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include but are not limited to the fair value of stock-based
compensation and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

ln
highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with
high credit quality financial institutions. The Company s accounts at these institutions are each insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation FDIC up to 250,000. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not reach bank balances
exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the exchange price that would
be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable
inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available
in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
(Level 3). 

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level
1 

Level
1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level
2 

Level
2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level
3 

Level
3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement
of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

F- 7 

The
fair value of accounts payable and accrued expenses, loans, and due to shareholder approximates their carrying amounts because of their
immediate or short-term maturity. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company follows ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and plans to recognize revenue from the sale of products
and services following the five steps procedure: 

Step
1: Identify the contract(s) with customers. 

Step
2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 

Step
3: Determine the transaction price. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations. 

Step
5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The
Company will recognize revenue as it transfers control of promised services to its customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these services. The Company is in its early stage and had
no revenues during years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

As
of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions,
or significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. 

Stock
Based Compensation 

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires
recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award
of equity instruments over the period the individual or entity is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of the services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. 

Earnings
(Loss) per Share 

The
Company computes earnings per share EPS in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Basic EPS is measured
as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., convertible securities,
options, and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential
common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded
from the calculation of diluted EPS. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, as the Company didn t have any potentially-dilutive instruments outstanding.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company s management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements and believes that these recent pronouncements will not
have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

NOTE
3 - GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31,
2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 441,464 a stockholders deficit of 182,828 and a working capital deficiency of
 182,828. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of 72,857 and cash used in operating activities of 15,442.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months
from the issue date of this report. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon initiating sales, obtaining
additional capital, and financing. The Company plans to raise funds through its planned Initial Public Offering and through a pre-listing
private market raise. There is currently no public market for our common stock. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy
to initiate sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The consolidated financial
statements do not include adjustments to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, as businesses and governments
have taken broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on
our operations to date, these conditions could significantly negatively impact the Company s business in the future. The Company
intends to continue to monitor the situation and may adjust its current business plans as more information and guidance become available. 

F- 9 

The
extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak ultimately impacts the Company s business, future revenues, results of operations and financial
condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the
duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity and longevity, the actions to curtail the virus and treat its impact (including an
effective vaccine), and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak
has subsided, the pandemic may result in a significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce the Company s ability
to access capital or its customers ability to pay for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect the Company s
liquidity. 

NOTE
4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s CEO advanced 8,437 and 22,246, respectively, in non-interest-bearing
demand loans to the Company, and was repaid 0 and 0, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 115,908 and 107,471,
respectively, due to the Company s CEO. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 209,000 and 320,000 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock to its
officers and directors for services rendered to the Company. The shares were valued at fair market value of 0.25 (2022) and 0.10 (2021)
per share, for total compensation of 52,250 and 32,000 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the 2021
amount, 16,000 was for 2021 compensation expense and 16,000 was for satisfaction of prior accrued wages.

The
Company has provided for a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of 92,707 on the expected future tax benefits from

Management
believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable in the future. Accordingly, the Company
provided for a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of 92,707 as of December 31, 2022. During the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, the valuation allowance increased by 15,300 and 11,266, respectively, primarily relating to net operating loss
carryforwards from the local tax regime.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time
period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
connection with this annual report, as required by Rule 13a -15d and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company s management, including our company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the existence
of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Company s Principal Executive and Principal Financial officer and effected by the Company s
board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

1. Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. 

2. Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors; and 

3. Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal
control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. As of December 31, 2022, management determined material
weaknesses occurred over our internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. 

The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s management considered to be material weaknesses under the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of
outside directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. Due to these
material weaknesses management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

8 

Material
Weakness Discussion and Remediation 

Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company s previous
reported financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside
directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures can result in the Company s determination to its financial statements for the future periods. 

We
are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent
with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when
funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the
audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists
which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company s Board. In addition, management
believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i)
insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application
of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further,
management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation
of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed
to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside
directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future. 

We
will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as
necessary and as funds allow. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer s last fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
