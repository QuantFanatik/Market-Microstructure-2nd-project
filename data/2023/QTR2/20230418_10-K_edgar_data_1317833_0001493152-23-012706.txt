Company
Overview 

Golden
Ally is focused on its Aquaporin AQP Bottled Water project, which is a derivative of an academic inspiration from the
2003 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, Dr. Peter Agre and Dr. Roderick MacKinnon jointly, for discoveries concerning channels in cell
membranes . Golden Ally has been working closely with experienced field experts and top scientific research institutions to apply
the theory of aquaporins into its commercialized products, i.e., the AQP Bottled Water. 

AQP
Bottled Water is the product of a unique water filtration technology derived from raw materials with exclusive access by Golden Ally.
The advanced technology can enhance water filtration for better body cell absorption. All AQP Bottled Water products
are expected to be produced through OEM arrangements and their distribution logistics will also be supported by the OEM partners. 

AQP
Bottled Water is an epoch-making product. Golden Ally has been running laboratory tests on its products at the David Geffen School of
Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. 

High-income
households are Golden Ally s targeted consumers due to a strong correlation between income level and health spending. The global
consumer pool for AQP Bottled Water is estimated at 17.61 million households. These households represent the portion that has an annual
household income of over 150,000 USD, a level that can potentially support annual household spending on healthcare products. 

Plan
of Operations 

In
order for us to implement our business plan over the next 12 months, we have identified various milestones that we are striving to achieve
and have taken various actions to achieve those milestones, including those outlined in this report. The Company regularly engages
with its manufacturing supplier. Multiple milestones have been achieved through collaboration efforts. The bottle has been designed and
mold been manufactured; label has also been designed up to FDA specifications; manufacturing lines design to our specific process requirement
has also been finished. The core filtering material has finally been manufactured, despite COVID-19 induced significant delays that constrained
our effort. We are actively pushing forward to produce our final production plan targeted for the middle of 2023. We have kept communication
with TCAM (defined below) about the progress of their marketing efforts. We are relying on TCAM to market our water according to the agreement,
all payments to TCAM have been current. COVID-19 and its indirect effects have been a big delay factor in the implementation of TCAM s
effort. 

Distribution
Method for Our Products 

In
June 2022 we entered into a Bottling Agreement (the Bottling Agreement with Azure Water Bottling of Florida, LLC Azure pursuant to which Azure will produce, bottle, label and ship our AQP active water products. The Bottling Agreement is for an initial
one-year term, subject to potential renewal at the election of Golden Ally. Azure is an integrated OEM bottler that supplies many beverage
products on the market. 

In
July 2022, we entered into a Supplier Agreement (the Supplier Agreement with Taucoin Asset Management, LLC TCAM , and entity owned and controlled
by a significant shareholder, 
pursuant to which the Company will supply TCAM with the Company s AQP water products for sale and distribution on a blockchain-based
platform being developed to facilitate sales of the Company s products (the Platform ). TCAM, and its related subsidiaries
and affiliates, is a financial technology company that develops certain blockchain-based technology solutions for business enterprises.
Also in July 2022 the Company and TCAM entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the Strategic Agreement related
to the parties collaboration and efforts in marketing and selling the Company s AQP water products through the platform,
selling licenses to clients to access the Platform, and related matters. 

Developments
with respect to the Supplier Agreement include: 

We
have kept the communications with TCAM about the progress of their marketing efforts. We are relying on TCAM to market our water according
to the agreement, all payments to TCAM have been current. 

The
Company has been engaged with our manufacturing supplier on weekly basis since the signing of the agreement. Multiple milestones have
been achieved through the collaboration efforts. The bottle has been designed and mold been manufactured; label has also been designed
up to FDA specifications; manufacturing lines design to our specific process requirement has also been finished. The core filtering material
has finally been manufactured, despite of COVID-19 induced significant delays that constrained our effort. 

4 

Marketing 

We
intend to continue to market our product through TCAM and to avail ourselves to the promotional activities of other companies and competitors
regarding the benefits of premium bottled water products. We anticipate that TCAM initial marketing thrust will be to support the retailers
and distribution network with point of sales displays and other marketing materials, strategically adding an extensive public relations
program and other marketing as the markets dictate. 

Competition 

The
commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants
are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital.
We compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including bottled water and numerous specialty beverages, such as: CORE Hydration,
SOBE , Snapple , AriZona Iced Tea, Vitaminwater , Gatorade Perform , and POWERADE . We compete indirectly with
major international beverage companies including but not limited to: The Coca-Cola Company , PepsiCo, Inc., The Nestl Group,
Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc, Danone S.A., The Kraft Heinz Company, and Unilever PLC. These companies have established market presence
in the United States and globally, and offer a variety of beverages that are competitors to our products. We face potential direct competition
from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter
the alkaline water market. 

We
will compete directly with other premium water producers and brands focused on the emerging health related beverage market including
Eternal, Essentia, Core, Icelandic, Real Water, AQUAHydrate, Mountain Valley, Qure, Penta, and Alka Power. Our competitors may introduce
larger sizes and offer them at an prices that are lower than our products. We can provide no assurances that consumers will continue
to purchase our products or that they will not prefer to purchase a competitive product. 

Intellectual
Property 

Where
available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs.
We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual
property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition
of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation
against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. 

Governmental
Regulation 

Any
third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental
protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will
be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect
such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 10 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. We believe that our future success will depend in part
on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and
we believe that our employee relations are good. 

Legal
Proceedings; Product Liability 

From
time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. Currently, we are not a party to
any material legal proceedings or subject to any material claims. The results of any future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty,
and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management
resources, and other factors.

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital 

We
have had limited operations and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor for the year ended December 31,
2022, based on our lack of an established source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going
concern. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred a cumulative deficit of 6,129,157. There is limited historical financial information
about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee
that we will be successful in our business operations. 

Our
business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible
delays in developing our products and market downturns. 

In
the year ended December 31, 2022, Golden Ally received 5,042,000 for stock subscriptions receivable related to its Common Stock, which occurred prior to the share exchange and reverse merger. We
expect to require further outside sources of liquidity and have no assurance that future financings will be available to us on acceptable
terms, or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations.
Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. If we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain
our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our business plans or we may be forced to cease operations. 

Going
Concern 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes Golden Ally will be able to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. No revenues have been generated to date and we expect limited
revenues. 

Results
of Operations 

During
year ended December 31, 2022, we did not generate any revenue. Our operating expenses year ended December 31, 2022 were 6,071,587 consisting
primarily of professional fees and other expenses paid to continue to develop and implement marketing strategies our products and
wages and salaries for Company personnel. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a loss from operations
of 6,071,587. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have any operations. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Golden
Ally used cash of 6,086,115 for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

On
July 12, 2022, Golden Ally entered into an agreement with a company owned by a related party, Taucoin Asset Management LLC, to

rent is currently 6,300 per month. 

The Company does not have any material future cash requirements for existing
contractual obligations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations
of accounting principles that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures in
our financial statements. We had no critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

We
have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding
our results, which are summarized in Note 3 to our financial statements. Although we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions
are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is collected and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for our Company. In designing
and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that no matter how well conceived and operated, disclosure
controls and procedures can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as
of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date ). Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
 transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
 financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
 are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
 Company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
 use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
 statements. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework (2013 framework) (COSO). Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022,
our internal control over financial reporting is not effective at the reasonable assurance level, principally due to the following: 

- 
 The Company has not established adequate financial
 reporting monitoring activities to mitigate the risk of management override, specifically because there are few employees and only
 one officers with management functions and therefore there is lack of segregation of duties. 
 
 - 
 An outside consultant assists
 in the preparation of the annual and quarterly financial statements and partners with the Company to ensure compliance with US GAAP
 and SEC disclosure requirements. 
 
 - 
 Outside counsel assists the
 Company in the external attorneys to review and edit the annual and quarterly filings and to ensure compliance with SEC disclosure
 requirements. 

At such time as the Company raises additional working capital it plans to add staff, initiate training, add additional
subject matter expertise in its finance area so that it may improve it processes, policies, procedures, and documentation of its internal
control processes. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
we are a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to issue an attestation report on our
internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

by the person holding those options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities
identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Golden Ally Lifetech Group, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Golden Ally Lifetech Group, Inc. the Company as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the two-year period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES 

Golden
Ally Lifetech Group, Inc. we , our , us , or the Company has the following securities described below registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). The following summary of the terms of our capital stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation Charter and our Amended and Restated Bylaws Bylaws ), in each case as amended and in effect
on the date hereof. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference
to, the applicable provisions of our Charter and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, of which
this Exhibit 4.1 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our Charter, our Bylaws, and the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL for more information. 

Authorized
Capital Stock 

The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 11,000,000,000 shares, of which 10,000,000,000 shares shall be common stock, par
value 0.00001 per share (the Common Stock ), and 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.00001 per
share (the Preferred Stock ). 

Each
holder of our Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably the dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board
of directors out of funds legally available therefor. If there is a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, holders of
our common stock would be entitled to share in our assets remaining after the payment of liabilities. Holders of our common stock have
no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to
the common stock. The outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of shares of our common stock are
not liable for further calls or to assessments by us. The rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subordinate
to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock which our board of directors
may designate and issue in the future. 

As
of March 31, 2023, 1,000,000,000 shares of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding. Each holder of Preferred Stock is entitled
to ten (10) votes per share held on all matters submitted to the shareholders of the Corporation for a vote thereon. Each share of Series
A Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder into one (1) share of Common Stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

We
have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our
common stock for the foreseeable future. We expect to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business.
Any future determination to pay dividends on our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon,
among other factors, our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and other factors
that our board of directors may deem relevant. 

The
holders of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends or distributions on a pro-rata basis with the
holders of Common Stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Dividends shall not be cumulative. No dividends
or distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Common Stock unless dividends or distributions on the Convertible
Series A Preferred Stock are likewise declared and paid or set apart for payment. No declared and unpaid dividends shall bear or accrue
interest. 

Delaware
Anti-Takeover Law 

We
are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL which contains anti-takeover provisions. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware
corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that
the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested
stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or another transaction
resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect
with respect to transactions that are not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result
in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders 

No
Cumulative Voting 

Under
the DGCL, cumulative voting for the election of directors is not permitted unless a corporation s certificate of incorporation
authorizes cumulative voting. Our Charter does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting allows
a minority stockholder to vote a portion or all of its shares for one or more candidates for seats on our board of directors. Without
cumulative voting, a minority stockholder will not be able to gain as many seats on our board of directors based on the number of shares
of our stock the stockholder holds as compared to the number of seats the stockholder would be able to gain if cumulative voting were
permitted. The absence of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for a minority stockholder to gain a seat on our board of directors
to influence our board s decision regarding a takeover. 

Stockholder
Action by Written Consent 

The
DGCL generally provides that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on such matter is required to amend a
corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws requires
a greater percentage. Our Charter permits our board of directors to amend or repeal most provisions of our Bylaws by majority vote. Generally,
our Charter may be amended by holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled
to vote. The stockholder vote or consent with respect to an amendment of our Charter or Bylaws would be in addition to any separate class
vote that might in the future be required under the terms of any series of preferred stock that might be outstanding at the time such
a proposed amendment were submitted to stockholders. The DGCL and the provisions of our Bylaws generally permit stockholders owning the
requisite percentage of shares of common stock necessary to approve an amendment to our Charter and Bylaws to act by written consent
in lieu of a meeting of our stockholders. 

Limitation
of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

Our
Bylaws provide indemnification, including advancement of expenses, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law to any person
made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the company, or is or was
serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including
service with respect to an employee benefit plan. In addition, our Charter provides that our directors will not be personally liable
to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of
loyalty to us or our shareholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions
or derived an improper personal benefit from their action as directors. This provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the
rights of any stockholder to seek nonmonetary relief such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a director s
duty of care. In addition, this provision does not limit the directors responsibilities under the DGCL or any other laws, such
as the federal securities laws. Our Bylaws also permit the Company to obtain insurance that insures our directors and officers against
certain losses and which insures us against our obligations to indemnify the directors and officers. We also have entered into indemnification
agreements with our directors and executive officers.
