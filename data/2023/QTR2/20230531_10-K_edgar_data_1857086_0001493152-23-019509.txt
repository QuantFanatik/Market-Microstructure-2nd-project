our

Item
 1. 
 Business. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on July 8, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination.
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private
placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward
purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the
owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

While
we have focused on targets in the healthcare industry with an equity value of approximately 300 million to 1 billion, we have also
actively explored business combination targets in other businesses, industries or geographical locations, including, but not limited
to, related industries such as consumer packaged goods, health wellness, technology, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, distribution,
logistics and brand management. On March 31, 2023, we entered into the TruGolf Business Combination Agreement, as more fully disclosed
under TruGolf Business Combination below. 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from July 8, 2020 (inception) through March 31, 2023,
relates to our formation and initial public offering, which is described below, and subsequent to the IPO, identifying a target company
for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the
earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the cash and marketable securities held in the trust
account. We have selected March 31 as our fiscal year end. 

Initial
Public Offering 

On
October 29, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 12,650,000 units at 10.00 per unit, which included 1,650,000 units issued pursuant to the
full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, and the private placement of an aggregate of 519,500 private placement
units to the sponsor and I-Bankers at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of 5,195,000
that closed simultaneously with the closing of the IPO. 

In
connection with its services as the representative of the underwriters for the IPO and as a result of the full exercise of the over-allotment
option , upon the closing of the IPO, we issued 101,200
representative shares to I-Bankers, along with a five-year warrant to purchase 632,500 shares of Class A common stock, equal to 5.0 
of the public shares issued in the IPO (the representative warrants ), which has an exercise price of 12.00 per share.
 I-Bankers has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of representative shares until the completion
of the initial business combination. In addition, I-Bankers has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares
in connection with the completion of the initial business combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to such shares if we fail to complete the initial business combination within the Combination Period.
 The representatives warrants may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, at any time during
the period commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the Registration Statement and the closing of the
initial business combination and terminating on the fifth anniversary of such effectiveness date. The representative warrants and such
shares purchased pursuant to the representative warrants were subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the
commencement date of sales in the IPO. The representative warrants grant to holders demand and piggy back rights for periods
of five and seven years, respectively, from the commencement date of sales in the IPO with respect to the registration under the Securities
Act of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the representative warrants. 

Transaction
costs amounted to 7,282,500 consisting of 2,530,000 in cash of underwriting commissions, 4,427,500 of the Marketing Fee, and 325,000
of other offering costs. 

Upon
the closing of the IPO, we deposited 127,765,000 10.10 per unit) from the proceeds of the IPO and certain proceeds of the sales of
the private placement units in the trust account, located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within
the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment
company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company
Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held
in the trust account, as described below. 

1 

Following
the closing of the IPO, cash of 764,101 was held outside of the trust account and was available for working capital purposes. As of
March 31, 2023, we had available cash of 595,536 on our balance sheet, including 554,873 distributed from the trust account for
tax payments, and a working capital deficit of 2,179,125 . 

Management
has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement units,
although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. There
is no assurance that we will be able to complete a business combination successfully. We must complete a business combination with one
or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80 of the net assets held
in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of
any deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination.
We will only complete a business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as
an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

It
is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Humphrey Polanen,
our Chief Executive Officer, who has (i) many years of experience in mergers and acquisitions, having been actively involved as an investor
and director in various venture capital backed companies in the technology industry, and (ii) served as a director of various private
equity funds. We must complete our initial business combination by July 29, 2023, 21 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
If our initial business combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, then our existence will terminate, and we
will distribute all amounts in the trust account. 

Extension
of our Combination Period and Founder Conversion 

Our
Initial Combination Period was extended until January 29, 2023 in the First Extension pursuant to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes (as further described below under Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business
Combination. On December 23, 2022, we held the 2022 Special Meeting at which our stockholders approved, among other things, an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business
combination to July 29, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors, and (ii) provide for the right of a holder
of Class B common stock to convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial business combination. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the above, the holders of 11,819,790 public shares properly exercised their right to redeem such
shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 121 million (approximately 10.24 per share)
was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. 

On
December 23, 2022, stockholders holding all of the issued and outstanding Class B common stock elected to convert their Class B common
stock into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result, 3,162,500 shares of Class B common stock were cancelled, and 3,162,500
shares of Class A common stock were issued to such holders of the converting Class B common stock. 

Following
the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the 2022 Special Meeting, and as of March 31, 2023, we had 4,613,410
shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding. 

Our
Securities 

Since
the IPO, our securities have been listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. On December 2, 2021, the units no longer traded, and the public
shares and rights underlying the units commenced trading separately. On February 15, 2023, we received approval from the Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Department of Nasdaq that our application to transfer the listing of the public shares and rights from the Nasdaq Global
Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market was approved. The public shares and rights were transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening
of business on February 17, 2023 and continue to trade under the symbol DMAQ and DMAQR, respectively. The
Nasdaq Capital Market operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market, and listed companies must meet certain financial
requirements and comply with Nasdaq s corporate governance requirements.

Acquisition
Criteria 

A
methodical and disciplined approach has been, and if the TruGolf Business Combination is not consummated, may continue to be used to
identify and evaluate potential acquisition targets. 

Nature
 of products and solutions. 

Opportunities
 for accelerating growth. 

Strong
 management teams. 

These
criteria are not exhaustive and we have considered these along with other key criteria along the journey to identify and evaluate companies.
There have been company-specific criteria that has emerged as we examined the products and business models of companies. Given the deep
and diverse experience of our team, we believe we have been able to discern the product- and company-specific criteria of success and
determine the company s strengths and weaknesses against those criterial and in the case of weaknesses, how our team can be a catalyst
in overcoming those weaknesses. 

Initial
Business Combination 

Nasdaq

the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair
market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member
of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our
board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination,
it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant
amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business
combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board
of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of TruGolf was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account
and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 

We
anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public
stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such
a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial
business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target,
our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case,
we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares,
our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. 

9 

If
less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company,
the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s
80 of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be
based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination
for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 

Our
Business Combination Process 

In
evaluating prospective business combinations, we conduct a thorough due diligence review process that encompasses, among other things,
a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site
inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or our officers or
directors. Our sponsor, owns approximately a 3 equity interest in TruGolf that was received as consideration for services provided under
a service agreement with TruGolf. Although the ownership interest of the sponsor in TruGolf may not rise to the level that it would cause
TruGolf to be deemed to be affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, our directors, have obtained an opinion from an independent
financial advisory firm that the initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. 

We
will issue to our officers and our directors an aggregate of 300,000 post business combination shares within 10 days following the business
combination, with the same lock-up restrictions and registration rights as the founder shares. Because of this arrangement, our sponsor
and our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate
business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of
interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors
were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 

Each
of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations
to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly,
if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or
she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors
will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly
offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally
and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer
is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 

Our
Management Team 

Members
of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time
as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of
our management team will devote in any time period varies based on the current stage of the business combination process. 

We
believe our management team s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies have provided, and if the TopGolf
Business Combination is not consummated, may continue to provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets.
Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships
in various industries. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses,
our management team s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management
team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

10 

Status
as a Public Company 

We
believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target
business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following
an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating
management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders interests than it would as a private company. A target business
can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In
a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the
target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class
A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. 

Although
there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a
more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial
public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there
are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road
show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

Furthermore,
once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial
public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions,
which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business
combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management
incentives consistent with stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public
company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting
talented employees. 

While
we believe that our structure and our management team s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential
target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder
approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory
vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find
our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities
may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following October 29, 2026, (b) in
which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which
means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior September 30,
and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally,
we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take
advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held
by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of the prior September 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during
such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior September
30. 

11 

Offering
Structure 

Unlike
other blank check companies that sold units comprised of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a full share of common stock
in their initial public offerings, we sold units, each unit comprised of one share of Class A common stock and one right that entitles
the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination.
Our management believes that investors in similarly structured blank check offerings, and those likely to invest in the IPO, have come
to expect the units of such companies to include one share of common stock and another security which would allow the holders to acquire
additional shares of common stock. Without the ability to acquire such additional shares of common stock, our management believes the
investors would not be willing to purchase units in such companies initial public offerings. Accordingly, because the number of
shares ordinarily issuable upon exercise of the warrants found in the structure of other blank check initial public offerings is lessened
in our case (since units often consist of a whole warrant that entitles the holder thereof to receive a full share of common stock as
opposed to the one-tenth (1/10) of one share the rights entitle a holder to receive), our management believes we may be viewed more favorably
by potential target companies when determining which company to engage in a business combination with. However, our management may be
incorrect in this belief. 

Financial
Position 

With
funds available for an initial business combination as of March 31, 2023 in the amount of approximately 9,160,803, assuming no further
redemptions and after reducing the balance for income taxes payable and after payment of 4,427,500 of Marketing Fee payable to I-Bankers,
in each case before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, together with the Marketing Fee, we offer a target
business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion
of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial
business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the
most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

Effecting
Our Initial Business Combination 

We
are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the IPO. We intend
to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement, the proceeds of the
sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop
agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued
to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business
combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would
subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If
our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account
are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A
common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for
maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred
in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We
may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the
amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of
the IPO and the sale of the private placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed
initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only
simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets
other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would
disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no
prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time,
we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the
sale of securities or otherwise. 

See
 TruGolf Business Combination above for more information on the financing of the TruGolf Business Combination.

Sources
of Target Businesses 

Target
business candidates have been and may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment
bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses have been and may continue to be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated
sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which
they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report and know what
types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our
attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries
or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we received a number of proprietary deal
flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers
and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates. 

Additionally,
pursuant to a business combination marketing agreement, we engaged I-Bankers as an advisor in connection with our business combination
and will pay I-Bankers the Marketing Fee for such marketing services upon the consummation of our initial business combination. I-Bankers 
financial interests tied to the consummation of a business combination transaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in
providing any such additional services to us, including potential conflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation
of an initial business combination. 

In
no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are
affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation
by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, is allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective
business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination prior to the business combination. However,
we will issue to our officers and directors an aggregate of 300,000 post business combination shares, with the same lock-up restrictions
and registration rights as the founder shares. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements
with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements
will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate.] 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with
our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership
with our sponsor, officers or directors. While the sponsor s equity interest in TruGolf may not rise to the level that would cause
TruGolf to be deemed to be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the TruGolf
Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated
with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company
from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business
of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business
combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently
have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Selection
of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq
rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value
of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing
a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination
will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as
discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial
metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market
value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of
FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board
of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may
be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount
of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated
industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted
flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our
initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

13 

In
any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business
or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be
taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the
possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. 

To
the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages
of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor
to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant
risk factors. 

In
evaluating a prospective business target, we conduct a thorough due diligence review, which encompasses among other things, meetings
with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as
a review of financial and other information that are made available to us. 

Any
costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination
is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack
of Business Diversification 

For
an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely
on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with
multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate
the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of
diversification may: 

subject
 us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the
 particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause
 us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team 

Although
we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of TruGolf, when evaluating the
desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the TruGolf Business
Combination is not consummated and we seek another initial business combination], our assessment of the target business management
may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage
a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be
stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company
will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated
in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including the TruGolf Business Combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent
to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience
or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

We
cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The
determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business
combination. 

14 

Following
an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business.
We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite
skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 

We
may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval
if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case in the TruGolf Business Combination as currently contemplated),
or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation
of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law
for each such transaction.

Under
Nasdaq s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we
 issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock
 then outstanding; 

any
 of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons
 collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise
 and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of
 5 or more; or 

the
 issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

Permitted
Purchases of our Securities 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase
shares or rights in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial
business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates
may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information
not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate
that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private
transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases
that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant
to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the
funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or rights in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business
combination. 

The
purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase
the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement
with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination,
where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of rights could be to reduce the
number of rights, or underlying shares, outstanding. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial
business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float 
of our shares of Class A common stock or rights may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced,
which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

15 

Our
sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers,
directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt
of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination.
To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact
only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account
or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial
business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply
with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

Any
purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange
Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability
for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be
complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates
will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases
will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting
requirements. 

Redemption
Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the
completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in
the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of
then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially approximately
 10.10 per public share. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter agreement with us,
pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares, representative
shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

See
 TruGolf Business Combination above for more information on the redemption process and specifics for the TruGolf Business
Combination. 

Manner
of Conducting Redemptions 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the
completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business
combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business
combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as
the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or
stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder
approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding
common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure
an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as
to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder
vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements
or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities
on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 

If
a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct
 the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file
 tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial
 and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the
 Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

16 

Upon
the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with
Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender
offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

In
the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days,
in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until
the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more
than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we
will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that
we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may
be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered
to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

If,
however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder
approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct
 the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation
 of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file
 proxy materials with the SEC. 

In
the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection
therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If
we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in
person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant
to the letter agreement, our initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers have agreed to vote their founder shares, private
placement shares, representative shares and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately
negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding
shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained.
As a result of the aggregate redemptions of public shares in connection with the 2022 Special Meeting and the number of outstanding founder
shares, private placement shares, representative shares and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market
and privately negotiated transactions) held by our initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers, unless otherwise required
under applicable law, we will not require the vote of the holders of any of the public shares sold in our initial public offering to
be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved, as the founder shares
now constitute more than a majority of the total outstanding shares of common stock. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not
less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve
our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make
it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption)
our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination
and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock 
rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business
combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its
owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash
to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash
consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount
required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of
cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock
submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

17 

Limitation
on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with
our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that
a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert
or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with
respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in the IPO (the Excess Shares. Such restriction shall also
be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and
subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination
as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other
undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in the IPO could
threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the
then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the
shares sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably
attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination
with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not
be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business
combination. 

Tendering
Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We
may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares
in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer
documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial
business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
the DWAC System, at the holder s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of
our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy
such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the
close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials,
as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period,
it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not
to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking
to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless
of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The
foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with
their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial
business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card
indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the
company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result,
the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she
could monitor the price of the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell
his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption
rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights
surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement
for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once
the initial business combination is approved. 

18 

Any
request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the
date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered
its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect
to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed
promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

If
our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their
redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case,
we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed initial
business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until
the end of the Combination Period. 

Ability
to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 

Our
Initial Combination Period was 12 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or until October 29, 2022. However, we had
the ability to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for
a total of up to 18 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and the trust agreement entered into between us and AST on October 26, 2021, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate
our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline,
had to deposit into the trust account up to 1,265,000 0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each
three month extension (or up to an aggregate of 2,530,000, or 0.20 per share, if we extend for the full six months). Our sponsor and
its affiliates or designees were not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the Initial Combination Period. 

To
effect the First Extension, on October 19, 2022, an aggregate of 1,265,000 pursuant to the First Sponsor Affiliate Note was deposited
into the trust account and the Initial Combination Period was extended from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, which amount will be
included in the pro rata amount distributed to (i) all of the holders of the public shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of the
public shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination. 

Instead
of utilizing the additional three-month extension available under the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we held the
2022 Special Meeting to give our stockholders the opportunity to further amend the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and approve the Second Extension. As a result, we now have until July 29, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the board) to complete
our business combination. 

If
we are unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose
of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions,
if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders
and the board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

Redemption
of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 

If
we are unable to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to 50,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders
and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims
of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect
to our rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. 

19 

Our
initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have
waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares
or representative shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. However,
if our initial stockholders officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination
Period. 

Our
initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders
with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.
However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001
either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and
commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised
with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above),
we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. We expect that all costs and expenses
associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded, to the extent possible, from
the remaining amounts held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any franchise and income tax obligations
we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution,
to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay franchise and income taxes on interest income
earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 50,000 of such accrued
interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

The
per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders was approximately 10.83 as of March 31, 2023. The proceeds
deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than
the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders
will not be substantially less than 10.83. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims
against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets.
These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we
intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all
creditors claims. 

Although
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit
of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that
they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of
fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order
to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses
to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives
available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such
third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where
we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise
or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver
or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. MaloneBailey and the underwriters of the
IPO will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

20 

In
addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising
out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor
has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us,
or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or
business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.10 per public share and
(ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than
 10.10 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply
to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust
account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such
indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations
and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would
be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without
limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In
the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets,
in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy
its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors
would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. 

While
we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for
example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if
the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification
obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that
due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.10 per public share. 

We
will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring
to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements
with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not
be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately 500,000 from the proceeds of the IPO with which to pay any such potential
claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately
 50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient,
stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses
exceed our estimate of 500,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case,
the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event
that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of 500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account
would increase by a corresponding amount. 

Under
the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by
them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public
shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period may be considered a liquidating
distribution under Delaware law. 

If
the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision
for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation,
a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating
distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser
of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder
would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

21 

Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period is not considered a liquidating distribution under
Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a
party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations
for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of
a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income
taxes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption
will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public
shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those
procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but
no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

Because
we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such
time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within
the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be
limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as
lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. 

As
described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers,
prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. 

As
a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that
would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary
to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets,
in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the
underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver
is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party
claims. 

If
we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the
trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of
third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot
assure you we will be able to return 10.10 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an
involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed
under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. 
As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors
may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and
our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our
public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of
our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to
amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption
of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within the Combination Period, subject to applicable
law. 

In
no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder
approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the initial business combination
alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such
stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 

22 

Competition 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as TruGolf, we have encountered and
may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank
check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations.
Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or
through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others
an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection
with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination,
and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors
may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We
currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote
as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time
they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have
any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We consider our relations with our employees to
be good. 

Periodic
Reporting and Financial Information 

Our
Class A common stock and rights have been registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations under such act, including
the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange
Act, our annual reports, such as this Report, will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered
public accountants. 

We
will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial
statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical
financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements
may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide
such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination
candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare
its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we
may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates,
we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We
will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth
company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity
to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.
We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent
to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following October 29, 2026, (b) in
which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which
means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior September
30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

Item
 1A. 
 Risk
 Factors. 

As
a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However,
below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we
 are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we
 may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed
 time frame, including the TruGolf Business Combination; 

our
 expectations around the performance of a prospective target business, such as TruGolf, or businesses may not be realized; 

we
 may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;

our
 officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have
 conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we
 may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the TruGolf Business Combination
 or reduce the number of stockholders requesting redemption; 

we
 may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing
 market price of our shares at that time; 

you
 may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust
 account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an
 active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the
 availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to
 the business combination; 

our
 financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack of an established
 record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

there
 may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated
 with completing our initial business combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target; 

changes
 in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate
 and complete an initial business combination; 

we
 may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial
 public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement
 agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions
 that will be released from the trust account only upon completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives
 may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering,
 including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

24 

we
 may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, such
 as TruGolf, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; 

since
 our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than
 with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers
 and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection
 with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate
 for our initial business combination; 

changes
 in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations,
 may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results
 of operations; 

the
 value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the
 nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.10 per share;

resources
 could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to
 locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination
 Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.10 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances,
 on the liquidation of our trust account; 

in
 March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential
 business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the
 time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial
 business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate
 the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

if
 we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome
 compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to
 modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business
 combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

to
 mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any
 time instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account
 in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation.
 As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on
 the funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption
 or liquidation of the Company; 

we
 may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with
 the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations,
 including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. We are a Delaware company and Ke Li, the managing member of our
 sponsor, is a citizen of the U.S. and a resident of Hong Kong SAR. Additionally, certain minority owners of our sponsor are citizens
 of China; 

recent
 increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an
 initial business combination; 

25 

military
conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult
for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

there
 is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and 

we
 have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. If we are unable to develop
 and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial
 results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business
 and operating results. 

Market
conditions, economic uncertainty or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability
to consummate a business combination. 

In
recent years, the United States and other markets have experienced cyclical or episodic downturns, and worldwide economic conditions
remain uncertain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, the Ukraine-Russia conflict, instability
in the U.S. and global banking systems, rising fuel prices, increasing interest rates or foreign exchange rates and high inflation and
the possibility of a recession. A significant downturn in economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to consummate a business
combination. 

We
cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or in any industry.
If the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition,
operating results and our ability to consummate a business combination could be adversely affected. For example, in January 2023, the
outstanding national debt of the U.S. government reached its statutory limit. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury
Department has announced that, since then, it has been using extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. government s default
on its payment obligations, and to extend the time that the U.S. government has to raise its statutory debt limit or otherwise resolve
its funding situation. The failure by Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling could have severe repercussions within the U.S. and
to global credit and financial markets. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its payment
obligations, or experience delays in making payments when due. A payment default or delay by the U.S. government, or continued uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling, could result in a variety of adverse effects for financial markets, market participants and U.S. and
global economic conditions. In addition, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility a downgrade in
the credit rating of the U.S. government and could result in economic slowdowns or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have
passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the
long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States as a result of disputes over the debt ceiling. The impact of a potential downgrade
to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect economic conditions,
as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate a business combination. 

A
1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination
or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption (a Redemption
Event ). 

Pursuant
to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act ), commencing in 2023, a 1 U.S. federal excise tax is imposed on certain
repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries
of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its stockholders. The amount
of the excise tax is equal to 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. The Treasury Department has authority to promulgate regulations
and provide other guidance regarding the excise tax. In December 2022, the Treasury Department issued Notice 2023-2, indicating its intention
to propose such regulations and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Under the interim rules, liquidating distributions
made by publicly traded domestic corporations are exempt from the excise tax. In addition, any redemptions that occur in the same taxable
year as a liquidation is completed will also be exempt from such tax. Accordingly, redemptions of our public shares in connection with
an extension of the combination period may subject us to the excise tax, unless one of the two exceptions above apply. Such redemptions
would only occur if an extension of the combination period is approved by our stockholders and such extension is implemented by the board
of directors. 

26 

If
the deadline for us to complete a business combination (currently July 29, 2023) is extended, our public stockholders will have the right
to require us to redeem their public shares. Any redemption or other repurchase may be subject to the excise tax. The extent to which
we would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Redemption Event would depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the fair
market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Redemption Event, (ii) the nature and amount of any PIPE 
or other equity issuances in connection with the business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Redemption Event
but issued within the same taxable year of the business combination), (iii) if we fail to timely consummate a business combination and
liquidate in a taxable year subsequent to the year in which a Redemption Event occurs and (iv) the content of any proposed or final regulations
and other guidance from the Treasury Department. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming
holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax remain to be determined. Any excise tax payable by us in connection
with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available to us to complete a business combination and could affect our ability
to complete a business combination. 

Adverse
developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance
by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects. 

The
funds in our operating account and our trust account are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest
bearing and interest-bearing accounts would exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance
limits. Should events, including limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the
banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally,
or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, our liquidity may be adversely affected. For example, on
March 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and
Innovation. Although we did not have any funds in Silicon Valley Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee
that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience similar issues. 

In
addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing
terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit
and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us in connection with a potential
business combination, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial condition or results
of operations, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this
time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences
directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. 

For
the complete list of risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our IPO Registration
Statement, (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on June 24, 2022, (iii) Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022
and February 10, 2023, respectively, and (iv) Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A as filed with the SEC on December 12, 2022. Any of these
factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks
could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. We may disclose changes to such
risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All
statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section
regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward- looking
statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, 
 intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed
in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf
are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on July 8, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination.
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private
placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward
purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the IPO or otherwise), shares issued to the
owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

Extension
of our Combination Period and Founder Conversion 

Our
Initial Combination Period was extended until January 29, 2023 in the First Extension pursuant to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes. On December 23, 2022, we held the 2022 Special Meeting at which our stockholders
approved, among other things, an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date by which we
must consummate an initial business combination to July 29, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by the board of directors, and (ii)
provide for the right of a holder of Class B common stock to convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing
of an initial business combination. 

In
connection with the vote to approve the above, the holders of 11,819,790 public shares properly exercised their right to redeem such
shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 121 million (approximately 10.24 per share)
was removed from the trust account to pay such holders. 

On
December 23, 2022, stockholders holding all of the issued and outstanding Class B common stock elected to convert their Class B common
stock into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result, 3,162,500 shares of Class B common stock were cancelled, and 3,162,500
shares of Class A common stock were issued to such holders of the converting Class B common stock. 

29 

Following
the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the 2022 Special Meeting, and as of March 31, 2023, we had 4,613,410
shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding. 

Our
Securities 

On
February 15, 2023, we received approval from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq that our application to transfer
the listing of the public shares and rights from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market was approved. The public shares
and rights were transferred to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on February 17, 2023 and continue to trade under
the symbol DMAQ and DMAQR, respectively. The Nasdaq Capital Market operates in substantially the same manner
as the Nasdaq Global Market, and listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq s corporate governance
requirements. 

TruGolf
Business Combination 

On
March 31, 2023, we entered into the TruGolf Merger Agreement with Merger Sub, the Purchaser Representative, TruGolf and the Seller Representative.

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities and those necessary to prepare for the IPO. Following the IPO, we have not and do not expect to generate any operating revenues
until after completion of our initial business combination. We generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash
and cash equivalents after the IPO in amount of 1,824,459 for the year ended March 31, 2023. There has been no significant change in
our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements contained
elsewhere in this Report. After the IPO, we incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public
company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence on prospective
business combination candidates. Our expenses have increased substantially after the closing of the IPO. 

For
the year ended March 31, 2023, we had a net loss of 400,232, which consists of 2,167,122 of operating and formation costs, offset by
the unrealized gain on our marketable securities held in the trust account of 1,824,459. 

For
the year ended March 31, 2022, we had a net loss of 414,045, which consists of 409,912 of operating and formation costs and unrealized
loss on our marketable securities held in the trust account of 4,133. 

Factors
That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot
at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they
may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
had cash of 595,536 on our balance sheet, including 554,873 distributed from the trust account for the tax payments as of March 31,
2023, and cash of 877,099 as of March 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had total current liabilities of 2,795,069 and 536,712,
respectively, and total current assets of 9,776,747 and 128,953,272, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, we had working capital deficit
of 2,179,125, a decrease of working capital of 2,834,818 as compared to March 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a decrease in cash
and prepaid expenses and an increase in total current liabilities. 

The
significant increase in accrued expenses as of March 31, 2023 was in connection with the due diligence on Chijet. In addition, on October
15, 2022, we issued the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes in an aggregate principal amount of 1,265,000 to two affiliates of the sponsor
in connection with the First Extension. Due to the stockholders redemption in December 2022 in connection with the 2022 Special
Meeting, cash and marketable securities held in trust account decreased to 9,160,803 as of March 31, 2023 compared to 127,760,867 as
of March 31, 2022, after 121,034,650 (approximately 10.24 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such redeeming holders.
In connection with the Second Extension, under the Second Sponsor Affiliate Note, an additional 100,000 was deposited in the aggregate
into the trust Account as of March 31, 2023 and a further 100,000 has been deposited subsequently. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of a business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
the business combination will be successful. 

For
the year ended March 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities amounted to 1,036,436, mainly due to the net loss of 400,232, the
unrealized income earned on investment held in the trust account in amount of 1,824,459, and the decrease in accrued expenses to related
parties by 15,000, offset by the decrease in prepaid expenses by 294,898 and the increase in accrued expenses and taxes payable by
 850,788 and 57,569, respectively. Comparatively, cash of 697,868 used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2022
was due to the net loss of 414,045, plus the increase in prepaid expenses by 277,806 and the decrease in accrued expenses to related
parties by 25,000, offset by the increase in accrued expenses by 14,850. 

Cash
flow of 120,424,523 provided by investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2023 was due to the distribution from the trust
account in amount of 754,873 for taxes payments, offset by the investment of 1,365,000 in the trust account, of which 1,265,000 was
to extend the Initial Combination Period in the First Extension pursuant to the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes and 100,000 was a partial
payment pursuant to the Second Sponsor Affiliate Note in connection with the Second Extension (under which a monthly payment of 50,000
should be deposited into the trust account after January 29, 2023). In addition, subsequent to and in connection with the 2022 Special
Meeting, stockholders holding 11,819,790 public shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds
in the trust account. As a result, 121,034,650 (approximately 10.24 per share) was released from the trust account to pay such holders.
Cash flow of 127,765,000 used in investing activities during the year ended March 31, 2022 was due to the investment of cash in the
trust account. 

Cash
flow of 119,669,650 used in financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2023 was due to the proceeds from related parties 
loans totaled 1,365,000 as discussed above, offset by the cash of 121,034,650 removed from the trust account to pay the redeeming shareholders
in December 2022. Cash flow of 128,839,900 from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2022 was due primary to the proceeds
from the sale of Units at the closing of the IPO in amount of 126,500,000, net of underwriting discounts of 2,530,000, the proceeds
from the sale of Private Placement Units in amount of 5,195,000, offset by the payment to the offering costs of 325,000 and the repayment
of 100 to due to related party. 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 9,160,803, after the 121,034,650 (approximately
 10.24 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay the redeeming holders in connection with the 2022 Special Meeting, substantially
all of which has been invested in U.S. treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less. Interest income earned on the balance in the
trust account may be available to us to pay taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including
any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account to complete our initial business combination. In December 2022, we withdrew
interest of 754,873 to pay franchise and income taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares
of our common stock authorized and outstanding after the completion of the IPO, to be 200,000, which is the maximum amount of annual
franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may pay from funds from the IPO held outside of the trust
account or from interest earned on the funds held in our trust account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax obligations
depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in trust account. The interest earned on the amount in the
trust account has been and we expect it will continue to be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our capital stock
or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the
trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions
and pursue our growth strategies. 

31 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had available cash of 595,536, including 554,873 distributed from the trust account for the tax payments. We
have used and will continue to use these funds to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective
target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives
or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete
an initial business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital
Loans as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay any Working Capital Loans. In the event that
our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay
any such Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working
Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent units at a price of 10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result
in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of Class A common stock if 1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights
included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination), at the option of
the lender. Such units would be identical to the private placement units. The terms of such Working Capital Loans by our sponsor or its
affiliates, or our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following the IPO in order to meet the expenditures required for conducting the
due diligence related to a proposed business combination and operating our business during this process. However, if our estimates of
the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination, including
the proposed business combination, are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or we are unable to complete the proposed business
combination, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we
may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem
a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, have targeted and if the TruGolf Business Combination
is not consummated, we will continue to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale
of the private placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business
combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion
of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient
funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business
combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

As
of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, we had loans payable to the sponsor and its affiliates in the amount of 1,865,000 and 500,000,
respectively, as discussed below: 

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO, our sponsor agreed to loan us 500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. The Sponsor
Note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon completion of our initial business combination. Under no circumstances shall any
individual, including but not limited to any officer, director, employee or stockholder, be obligated personally for any obligations
or liabilities of the Sponsor Note. 

On
October 15, 2022, we issued the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes to two affiliates of the sponsor in connection with the First Extension,
from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. The First Sponsor Affiliate Notes bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the earlier
of (a) the date of the consummation of the initial business combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. 

On
October 19, 2022, an aggregate of 1,265,000 from the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes was deposited into the trust account, which amount
will be included in the pro rata amount distributed to (i) holders of public shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of public shares
who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination. 

32 

On
February 9, 2023, we issued the Second Sponsor Affiliate Note to an affiliate of the sponsor, in connection with the Second Extension,
from January 29, 2023 to July 29, 2023, pursuant to which a monthly payment of 50,000 is to be deposited into the trust account after
January 29, 2023. The Second Sponsor Affiliate Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the
consummation of the initial business combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. Accordingly, an aggregate of 100,000 had been
deposited into the trust account as of March 31, 2023 and an additional 100,000 has been deposited subsequently. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it
pursues an initial business combination target. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with FASB ASU Topic 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist solely of pursuing a business combination. 

The
Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s
working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier
of consummation of a Business combination or the deadline to complete a business combination pursuant to the Company s amended
and restated certificate of incorporation (unless otherwise amended by stockholders). 

While
the Company expects to have sufficient access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part
of any financing source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately
be available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the consummation
of a business combination or for a period of time within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. There is
no assurance that the Company s plans to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate a business
combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As
is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a business combination during the Combination
Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a business
combination during the Combination Period. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2023. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay our Chief Financial Officer monthly fee of 5,000 for accounting, administrative and support services. We will continue to incur
these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation. 

The
underwriters of the initial public offering are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per unit, or 4,427,500 in the aggregate. The deferred
fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete a business
combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have
not identified any critical accounting policies . 

33 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our condensed financial statements.

 Controls
 and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this Report, due to the inadequate segregation of duties within our account processes since we
had limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT and financial reporting and record keeping. 

In
light of this material weakness, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements
to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making
greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation
plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.
We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but we can offer no assurance
that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
 assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

(3) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our
review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to
accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and
consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to
our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March
31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On April 26, 2022, the Court granted Ms. Luo judgment as a matter of law and dismissed all claims against her. 

Number
and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

We
have six directors. Our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and
each class serving a two-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we were not required to hold an annual
meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors,
consisting of Tina Spires, HongLiang Ren and John Chiang, expired at the 2022 Special Meeting, which was held in lieu of our first annual
meeting of stockholders. Each of Tina Spires, Bryant E. Fong, HongLiang Ren and Marc A. Hamer was re-elected as directors at the 2022
Special Meeting, with a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors,
consisting of Humphrey P. Polanen, Ronald M. Razmi and Wanlei Miao, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding stock. 

Our
officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our
bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President,
Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited
exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of
independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors. 

38 

Audit
Committee 

We
have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Wanlei Miao and HongLiang Ren serve as members of our audit committee,
and John Chiang chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least
three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Wanlei Miao, HongLiang Ren and John Chiang meets the independent
director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each
member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Chiang qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We
have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the
 appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm
 engaged by us; 

pre-approving
 all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and
 establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting
 clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited
 to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting
 clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining
 and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent
 registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent
 internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional
 authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken
 to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the
 independent registered public accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing
 and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404
 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing
 with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory
 or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published
 reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting
 standards or rules promulgated by the FASB, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

Compensation
Committee 

We
have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. HongLiang Ren and John Chiang serve as members of our compensation
committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation
committee, all of whom must be independent. HongLiang Ren and John Chiang are independent, and John Chiang chairs the compensation committee. 

We
have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing
 and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation,
 if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining
 and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing
 and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing
 on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

39 

implementing
 and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting
 management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving
 all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if
 required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing,
 evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

No
compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our existing stockholders,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation
of an initial business combination, except that we pay Weixuan Luo, our Chief Financial Officer, monthly fees of 5,000 for her services
commencing on August 1, 2020. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation
committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection
with such initial business combination. 

The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Director
Nominations 

We
do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required
to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend
a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. 

The
board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving
director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who will participate in the consideration and
recommendation of director nominees are Tina Spires, HongLiang Ren, Wanlei Miao and John Chiang. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the
Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee
charter in place. 

The
board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are
seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders).
Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our
bylaws. 

We
have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess.
In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of
professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent
the best interests of our stockholders. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. A copy of our Code of ethics and our audit and compensation
committee charters have been filed as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement. You will be able to review these documents by accessing
our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without
charge upon request from us. Requests for copies of our code of ethics should be sent in writing to 595 Madison Avenue, 12 th 
Floor, New York, NY 10017. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our code of ethics in a Current
Report on Form 8-K. 

40 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class
of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and
other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to
furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished
to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, all
reports applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner in accordance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. except as set forth below: 

Humphrey
J Polanen filed one late Form 3. 

Item
 11. 
 Executive
 Compensation. 

We
pay Weixuan Luo, our Chief Financial Officer, monthly fees of 5,000 for her services commencing on August 1, 2020. Upon completion of
our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We will also issue to our officers and
directors an aggregate of 300,000 post business combination shares within 10 days following the business combination, with the same lock-up
restrictions and registration rights as the founder shares. 

Other
than the foregoing, no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect
of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers,
prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates.
Any such payments prior to an initial business combination are made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly
audit committee review of such payments, we have not had and do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement
payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating
an initial business combination. 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting
or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business
combination, such as the TruGolf Proxy Statement. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the
combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time
of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining
officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors
for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent
directors on our board of directors. 

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any
agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.

 Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

In
March 2021, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 founder shares to our initial stockholders for an aggregate purchase price of 50,000
in cash, or approximately 0.017 per share, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 2,875,000 founder shares (up
to 375,000 shares of which were subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option
was exercised). The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent
20 of our outstanding shares upon completion of the IPO (not including the shares of Class A common stock underlying the private placement
units or the representative shares). In October 2021, we effected a 0.1 for 1 stock dividend for each share of Class B common stock outstanding,
resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 3,162,500 founder shares. The founder shares (including the Class A common stock that
is issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. 

43 

On
December 23, 2022, we held the 2022 Special Meeting at which our stockholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation to provide for the right of a holder of Class B common stock to convert into Class A common
stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an initial business combination. 

Also
on December 23, 2022, stockholders holding all of the issued and outstanding Class B common stock elected to convert their Class B common
stock into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result, 3,162,500 shares of Class B common stock were cancelled, and 3,162,500
shares of Class A common stock were issued to such holders of the converting Class B common stock. 

Our
sponsors have purchased an aggregate of 406,500 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of 4,065,000 and
I-Bankers purchased an aggregate of 113,000 units at a price of 10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of 1,130,000. The private
placement units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, so long as they are held by our sponsor or the underwriters or their permitted
transferees, and (i) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after
the completion of our initial business combination, and (ii) will be entitled to registration rights. The private placement units (including
the private placement shares, the private placement rights, and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion thereof)
may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business
of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or
contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have
certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

We
pay Weixuan Luo, our Chief Financial Officer, monthly fees of 5,000 for her services commencing on August 1, 2020. Upon completion of
our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We will also issue to our officers and
directors an aggregate of 300,000 post business combination shares within 10 days following the business combination with the same lock-up
restrictions registration rights as the founder shares. 

Other
than the foregoing, no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect
of any payment of a loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers,
prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates
and determines which expenses and the amount of expenses that are reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

As
of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, we had loans payable to the sponsor and its affiliates in the amount of 1,865,000 and 500,000,
respectively, as discussed below: 

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO, our sponsor agreed to loan us 500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. The Sponsor
Note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due upon completion of our initial business combination. Under no circumstances shall any
individual, including but not limited to any officer, director, employee or stockholder, be obligated personally for any obligations
or liabilities of the Sponsor Note. 

On
October 15, 2022, we issued the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes to two affiliates of the sponsor in connection with the First Extension,
from October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023. The First Sponsor Affiliate Notes bear no interest and are repayable in full upon the earlier
of (a) the date of the consummation of the initial business combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. 

On
October 19, 2022, an aggregate of 1,265,000 from the First Sponsor Affiliate Notes was deposited into the trust account, which amount
will be included in the pro rata amount distributed to (i) holders of public shares upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of public shares
who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination. 

On
February 9, 2023, we issued the Second Sponsor Affiliate Note to an affiliate of the sponsor, in connection with the Second Extension,
from January 29, 2023 to July 29, 2023, pursuant to which a monthly payment of 50,000 is to be deposited into the trust account after
January 29, 2023. The Second Sponsor Affiliate Note bears no interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of (a) the date of the
consummation of the initial business combination, or (b) the date of our liquidation. Accordingly, an aggregate of 100,000 had been
deposited into the trust account as of March 31, 2023 and an additional 100,000 has been deposited subsequently. 

44 

Under
no circumstances shall any individual, including but not limited to any officer, director, employee or stockholder, be obligated personally
for any obligations or liabilities of the loans payable to the Sponsor and its affiliates. 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required.
If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such Working Capital Loans. In the event that the initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay any such Working Capital Loans but
no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible
into private placement-equivalent units at a price of 10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000
shares of Class A common stock if 1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights included in such units would result
in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination), at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical
to the private placement units. The terms of such Working Capital Loans by our sponsor or its affiliates, or our officers and directors,
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide
a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender
offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders, such as the TruGolf Proxy Statement. It is unlikely
the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder
meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation. 

Our
initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have
waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares, private placement shares
or representative shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. However,
if our initial stockholders, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination
Period 

We
have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the private placement units, the private placement shares, the private
placement rights, the representative shares, the representative warrants, the securities issuable upon conversion of Working Capital
Loans (if any), the post business combination shares, and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion or
exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the founder shares.

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Tina Spires, HongLiang Ren, Wanlei Miao
and John Chiang are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent
directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Deep
Medicine Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Deep Medicine Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of March 31, 2023 and
2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within
a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

of the Class A common stock sold in the Company s IPO Public Shares upon the Company s liquidation or (ii)
holders of Public Shares who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of the Company s initial Business
Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), the Company
will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than 10 business
days thereafter, redeem of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then
on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the
number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate,
subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of
other applicable law. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares if the Company fails
to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in
or after the IPO, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below). The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their
business combination marketing fees (see Note 9) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Initial Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that
will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value
of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the IPO price per Unit ). 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or by a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement,
reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) per Public Share or (2) such lesser amount per Public Share held
in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case
net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third
party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party,
the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility
that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers
(other than the Company s independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business,
execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the
Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable
to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily
be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company
cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management
continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that
the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target
company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this financial statement. The financial statement does not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Going
Concern and Management s Plan 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial Business Combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it
pursues an initial Business Combination target. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU Topic 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern the Company does not currently have adequate liquidity to sustain operations, which consist
solely of pursuing a Business Combination. 

The
Company may raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from the Sponsor or its stockholders, officers, directors,
or third parties. The Company s officers and directors and the Sponsor may, but are not obligated to (except as described above),
loan the Company funds, from time to time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s
working capital needs. Based on the foregoing, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its needs through the earlier
of consummation of a Business Combination or the deadline to complete a Business Combination pursuant to the Company s Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (unless otherwise amended by stockholders). 

While
the Company expects to have sufficient access to additional sources of capital if necessary, there is no current commitment on the part
of any financing source to provide additional capital and no assurances can be provided that such additional capital will ultimately
be available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the consummation
of a Business Combination or for a period of time within one year after the date that these financial statements are issued. There is
no assurance that the Company s plans to raise additional capital (to the extent ultimately necessary) or to consummate a Business
Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As
is customary for a special purpose acquisition company, if the Company is not able to consummate a Business Combination during the Combination
Period, it will cease all operations and redeem the Public Shares. Management plans to continue its efforts to consummate a Business
Combination during the Combination Period.

make the determination of how to treat fractional shares at the time of its initial Business Combination and will include such determination
in the proxy materials that it will send to stockholders for their consideration of such initial Business Combination.

MEDICINE ACQUISITION CORP. 

 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 MARCH
31, 2023 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the
Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution
from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless.
Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of a Business
Combination. 

Additionally,
in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the rights, and the rights may expire worthless. 

Representative
Warrants and Representative Shares 

Upon
the closing of the IPO, the Company issued to the Underwriters Representative Warrants, the exercise price of which will be per
Share, and Representative Shares. 

The
Representative Warrants shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, commencing the later of October 26, 2022 and the closing of the Company s
initial Business Combination and terminating on October 29, 2026. The Company accounted for the warrants as an expense of the
IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The fair value of Representative Warrants was estimated to be approximately
 (or per warrant) using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the Representative Warrants granted
to the Underwriters was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of , (2) risk-free
interest rate of and (3) expected life of . The Representative Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock underlying
Representative Warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a -day lock-up immediately following October
29, 2021 pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1). 

The
Representative Warrants grants to holders demand and piggy back rights for periods of five and seven years from October
29, 2021. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which
will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Representative Warrants
may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or the Company s recapitalization, reorganization,
merger or consolidation. However, the Representative Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class A common stock at a price below
its exercise price. 

The
Underwriters agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Representative Shares without the Company s prior written consent
until the completion of the Business Combination. The Underwriters agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares
in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from
the Trust Account with respect to the Representative Shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within
Initial Combination Period. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of
180 days immediately following October 29, 2021 pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1).

Exhibit
4.6 

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED 

As
of March 31, 2023, Deep Medicine Acquisition Corp. we, our, us or the Company had the following two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ): its (i) Class A common stock, 0.0001 par value per share Class A common stock ), and (ii) public rights,
with each right exchangeable into one-tenth of one share of Class A common stock (the rights ). As of March 31, 2023, we
had no units or shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 110,000,000 shares of common stock,
including 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 0.0001 par value (the Class
B common stock ), and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 0.0001 par value. The following description summarizes
the material terms of our capital stock and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference
to, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our rights agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference
as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023 (the Report of which this Exhibit 4.6
is a part. 

Defined
terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Report. 

Class
A Common Stock 

Common
stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of the Class
A common stock and holders of any issued and outstanding Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted
to a vote of our stockholders, except as required by law. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with
the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our stockholders
are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. 

We
will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial
business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of
two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
subject to the limitations described herein. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, any private
placement shares, representative shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate
of 15 of the shares of common stock sold in the initial public offering (the Excess Shares ). However, we would not be
restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business
combination. 

Our
stockholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business
combination, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market.
Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete the initial
business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15 and, in order to
dispose such shares would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after an initial business combination, our stockholders are entitled
to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made
for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Our stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights.
There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock, except that we will provide our stockholders with the opportunity
to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, upon
the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described in the Report. 

Public
Rights 

Each
holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination,
even if the holder of such right redeemed all shares of common stock held by it in connection with the initial business combination.
No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation
of an initial business combination, as the consideration related thereto was included in the unit purchase price paid for by investors
in the initial public offering. 

If
we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement
will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the
transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis, and each holder of a public right will automatically receive the 1/10 share of
common stock underlying such public right (without paying any additional consideration).If we are unable to complete an initial business
combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive
any such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets held outside of the trust account
with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. 

Upon
the consummation of our initial business combination, we will issue to each registered holder of the public rights the number of full
shares of common stock to which he, she or it is entitled, registered in such name or names as may be directed by him, her or it and
issue to such registered holder(s) a certificate or book-entry position for such shares. 

Additionally,
in no event will we be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, you might not receive the shares of Class A common stock
underlying the rights. 

The
shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours). We will not
issue fractional shares upon conversion of the rights. If, upon conversion of the rights, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, we will, upon conversion, comply with Section 155 of the DGCL (which provides that Delaware companies shall either
(1) arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto, (2) pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share
as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined or (3) issue scrip or rights in registered form (either represented
by a certificate or uncertificated) or in bearer form (represented by a certificate) which shall entitle the holder to receive a full
share upon the surrender of such scrip or rights aggregating a full share). We will make the determination of how we are treating fractional
shares at the time of our initial business combination and will include such determination in the proxy materials we will send to stockholders
for their consideration of such initial business combination.
