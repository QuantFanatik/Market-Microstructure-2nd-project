We generally use words such as "believe," "may," "could," "will," "intend," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this report. Although the forward-looking statements herein reflect our focused actual intentions, and although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made, and our future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements may not meet these expectations. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this document to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. All references in this Annual Report to the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" are to Tautachrome, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary(ies). Since its public announcement on September 25, 2017 (via SEC form 8-K) that it would be using its Twitter site (@Tautachrome_Inc) https://twitter.com/tautachrome_inc to post important Company information, and finding this method of publicizing important Company information both fast and effective, the Company has continued to use this means of public communication almost exclusively, supplemented occasionally with Current Reports via SEC Form 8-Ks. Shareholders are advised to follow us on Twitter to be current on the Company s disclosures in conformity with Regulation FD. Item 1. Business Factors History The Company was formed in Delaware on June 5, 2006 as Caddystats, Inc. On March 3, 2009, the Company acquired all of the voting shares of Roadships Holdings, Inc., a Florida Corporation, and Roadships America, Inc., also a Florida Corporation in exchange for an aggregate of 16,025,000 shares of the Company s common stock. On March 4, 2009, the Company changed its name to Roadships Holdings, Inc. On May 26, 2015, the Company acquired all the voting shares of Click Evidence Inc., an Arizona corporation. Effective November 2, 2015, the Company changed its name to Tautachrome Inc. Our Business Tautachrome operates in the internet applications space, uniquely exploiting the technologies of the Augmented Reality sector, the blockchain/cryptocurrency sector and the smartphone picture and video technology sector. We have high-speed blockchain concepts under development aiming to couple with the Company s patents and licensing in augmented reality, smartphone-image authentication and imagery-based social networking. Tautachrome is currently pursuing four main avenues of business activity based on our patented activated imaging technology, our blockchain cryptocurrency products, and our licensing of the patent pending ARk technology (together banded KlickZie technology): 1. KlickZie ARk technology business: The Company has licensed and is developing a new KlickZie augmented reality AR platform branded ARknet. ARknet enables goods and services providers to establish geolocated augmented reality interfaces, called ARks, allowing consumers to purchase the provider s products and take advantage of is specials and discounts, using the ARk. A provider s ARk may be located anywhere in the world, from a store location to anyplace else the provider may desire. The ARknet is a fintech platform connecting consumers to providers in the global 50+ trillion household goods market, using augmented reality as the medium of interaction. 2. KlickZie s blockchain cryptocurrency-based ecosystem: The Company has developed its own digital currency XAR ), smart contracts using XARs, and high speed blockchain concepts aimed at supporting fast frictionless transactions within the ARknet as well as incentivizing user activity in the development of ARknet infrastructure and the use of ARknet services. 3 Table of Contents 3. KlickZie Activated Digital Imagery business: The Company is developing downloadable apps based on our patented KlickZie trusted imaging and image-based social interactions using the pictures and videos that smartphone users create. 4. New Platform Exploitation: The Company is looking to exploit its KlickZie technology to generate substantial revenues partnering with Fortune 50 corporations via novel platforms introduced to the Company by Mr. Timothy Holly (the PXR Platforms ), our new director appointed to the Board on December 22, 2022. In the long term, we envision a KlickZie ARknet with billions of users and ARks connecting humanity, commerce, information, crypto currency, and innovation in economically useful ways. In the mid-term, we aim to achieve significant cash flow by coupling the KlickZie and PXR Platforms together to develop unique partnerships with a number of Fortune 50 corporations. Competition With regard to the internet applications in general, competition is intense. According to Statista there are millions of smartphone applications available to users. In spaces that are this crowded the principal matter of competition is about capturing user mind space, which for a given product consists of elements such as degree of product exposure to users, degree of product apparent desirability, pleasure of product usage, and persisting necessity for the product in a user s life. These elements of competition are well known to our competitors which include the internet giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom have financial resources and operating staffs substantially larger than those of the Company, and all of whom can focus on the optimization of their products towards the same consumer and business arenas upon which we intend to focus. With regard to the ARknet augmented reality space, while there is no direct competition in the space at the moment, that could change in a heartbeat with an interest taken by any of the internet giants mentioned above. With regard to KlickZie s technology for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there are many firms who mark, store and track digital imagery. Among these have been Digimarc, BatchPhoto, and Thirdlight who have marketed such processes for purposes of protecting intellectual property. To our knowledge none of these has turned the smartphone into a generally trustable imager or an advanced image-based communicator as envisioned here. This requires substantially more talent and development activity than required for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery. However, there is nothing stopping any firm, particularly the internet giants, from entering into similar activity. Moreover Truepic, which entered the arena of smartphone trusted imagery, also has patents related to trusted imagery. We have reviewed Truepic s patent claims and believe that our planned applications do not infringe their claims. Intangible Properties: issued and pending patents The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our technologies, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success could substantially depend upon our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies and know-how, to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek patent protection for our technologies. Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents or licenses which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of technology companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology licensing, and the patents which we hold and for which we have applied, do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our technology and patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. 4 Table of Contents As of the date of this annual report, our patent portfolio includes the patents and applications issued by and filed with the USPTO and the purchase technology licensing as described in the following table: Title Status Patent or Application Number License date Patent Grant or Application Date License to commercialize the patent: Exploitation Of Augmented Reality And Cryptotoken Economics In An Information-Centric Network Of Smartphone Users And Other Imaging Cyborgs Patent pending owned by Arknet Inc licensed to Tautachrome 62/755589 11/05/2018 Authentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery Patent granted to owned by Tautachrome 9582843 02/28/2017 Authentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery Patent granted to owned by Tautachrome 10019774 07/10/2018 Authentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery Patent granted to owned by Tautachrome 10019773 07/10/2018 System And Method For Creating, Processing, And Distributing Images That Serve As Portals Enabling Communication With Persons Who Have Interacted With The Images Patent granted to owned by Tautachrome 9928352 03/27/2018 System And Method For Creating, Processing, And Distributing Images That Serve As Portals Enabling Communication With Persons Who Have Interacted With The Images Patent granted to owned by Tautachrome 910,339,283 B2 07/02/2019 System And Method For Creating Geo-located Augmented Reality Communities Patent granted and owned by Arknet Inc licensed to Tautachrome 11,461,974 10/20/2022 Advanced Signal Processing and Fusion for AR, MR, and VR Applications with Attention Mechanisms, RNN Autoencoders, and Multi-Modal Integration.

Recent Sales of Equity Securities We issued 227,485,212 shares in conversion of outstanding convertible promissory notes. We issued 33,236,858 shares for conversion of accounts payable balances. We issued 98,896,076 shares to settle stock payable balances. We issued 3,000,000 shares to a Director We issued 7,850,000 shares to a creditor as an enticement for a loan.

Selected Financial Data We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A provides information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This MD A should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See Forward-Looking Statements elsewhere in this report. Overall Performance We are an early stage internet applications company, engaged in advanced technology and business development in the internet applications space. We have incurred general and administrative costs, marketing expenses and research and development costs since we commenced our current operations in May 2015, against very little revenue. The Company s audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. We had negative cash flows from operations of 613,787 and 1,249,760 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with recurring losses and negative working capital of 5,404,277 and 4,644,642 as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon our ability to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future. The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through loans from related parties. We believe that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding may provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee, however, that the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives. 8 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2022 and 20 21 Net Comprehensive Loss The Company realized a net comprehensive loss of 1,112,225 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net comprehensive loss of 5,026,747 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue and Cost of Sales The Company recognized minimal revenues and cost of sales for both years as the company s product has not been fully taken to market. Operating Expenses The Company s total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,072,022 compared to 4,267,148 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 3,195,126. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of 591,907 compared to 2,862,773 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 2,270,866. The following table sets out the material components of the Company s general and administrative for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Year Ended December 31, General and Administrative Expenses 2022 2021 Legal and accounting fees 101,733 132,486 Consulting 76,700 138,385 Other professional services 97,787 97,847 Office and occupancy costs 15,077 9,897 Arknet license fees 200,000 200,000 Advertising and promotion 100,315 2,276,445 Other 295 7,713 591,907 2,862,773 The vast majority of change from 2021 to 2022 was in advertising and promotion (a decrease of 2,161,648, or a 96 decrease). Most of this decrease resulted from our issuance of 198,000,000 shares in 2021 issued to a supplier to pay for media buys which resulted in a charge to Advertising and Promotion of 1,980,000. No such issuance occurred in 2022. Research and development Research and development costs were 1,239,133 in 2021 versus 465,633 in 2022 owing to decreased development activity. Bad Debt Expense On June 8, 2021, we loaned a board member 150,000 on a promissory note which was due upon demand. The company made demand for re-payment and the board member defaulted on the note. At the time of default, 760, in interest had accrued. We charged the entirety of principal and interest to Bad Debt Expense. We had no such item in 2022. 9 Table of Contents Depreciation Expense We had depreciation expense of 14,482 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as our assets are depreciated using the straight-line method and the asset base has not been changed. Other Expenses Other Expenses dropped significantly from the previous year due to decreased activities. 2021 saw a significant amount of discount amortization 1,092,397 versus only 593,261 in 2022. Other Comprehensive Loss At each balance sheet date, transactions and balances that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate which may give rise to a foreign currency translation adjustment accounted for as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income. The Company recorded a translation gain of 56,667 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a gain of 53,444 for the year ended December 31, 2021. These amounts are included in the Company s statement of operations as foreign currency gain (loss) for the respective years. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of the date of this report, the Company has generated only minimal revenues and is not profitable. The Company s operations to date have been funded primarily by private placements of common stock and convertible notes, as well as by loans from its management and controlling stockholders. As at December 31, 2022, the Company had 10,361 in cash and 5,414,638 in current liabilities resulting in a working capital deficit of 5,404,277. The Company is not currently able to maintain its operations through its existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows. Moreover, we have determined that the current capital structure of the Company is not adequate to fund its planned growth. We intend to secure additional capital to fund the Company s operations through the issuance of common stock, convertible debt instruments and loans from our management. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the capital the Company requires to achieve its business objectives, or that such capital will be available on acceptable terms. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including technology development costs, technology product rollout and support expense and the demand for the Company s products and services. Operating Activities During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used net cash of 613,787 in operating activities compared to 1,249,760 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company s average monthly cash burn rate was 51,150 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 104,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Subject to the success of the Company s financing activities, we expect to increase operating activities in the coming year with a concomitant increase in the Company s monthly burn rate. We will not be able to predict the increase to our burn rate until we have determined the outcomes of our financing activities. Financing Activities The Company received net cash of 323,400 from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, consisting primarily from the issuance of convertible notes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received a net of 1,439,902 from financing activities which, again, we primarily from the issue of convertible notes. We expect to continue our financing activities to fund our operations until such time as the Company s technologies are commercialized and we generate revenue on a profitable basis. Investing Activities In 2021, we loaned a board member 150,000 on a promissory note which was due upon demand. The company made demand for re-payment and the board member defaulted on the note. We had no such item in 2022. 10 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company s financial statements is critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of convertible debentures, assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) Accounting Codification Standard No. 820 ASC 820), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible notes. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company s cash is determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of the Company s other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have reviewed the FASB issue Accounting Standards Update, ASU accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the period reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration. Item 7A.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tautachrome, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the two-year period then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its consolidated operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. F-1 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Convertible Notes Payable and Derivative Liabilities As discussed in Note 5, the Company borrows funds through the use of convertible notes payable that contain a conversion price that may be fixed or fluctuates with the stock price. Due to the fluctuation of the conversion price, the embedded conversion feature requires bifurcation from the host contract and is recorded as a liability subject to market adjustments as of each reporting period. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining derivative liability values for these convertible note agreements, including the use of a specialist engaged by management. We evaluated management s conclusions regarding their derivative liability and reviewed support for the significant inputs used in the valuation model, as well as assessing the model and disclosures for reasonableness. /s/ M K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2008 May 20, 2023 F-2 Table of Contents TAUTACHROME, INC.

Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. To address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the 2013 criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses. As of December 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment. Specifically we have not developed and effectively communicated to our employees our accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further, the Board of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization, management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 13 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. Because of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the COSO. Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during quarterly period ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

Board of Directors and Committees At December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors presently consisted of three members: Dr. Jon Leonard, David LaMountain and Timoth Holly. Our Bylaws generally provide for majority approval of directors in order to adopt resolutions, and provide that the Board of Directors may be expanded by Board action. All executive officer compensation, including payroll expenditures, salaries, stock options, stock incentives, and bonuses, must be approved by the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors. The entire Board of Directors acts as the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. On future compensation matters, the Board will consider and recommend payroll expenditures, salaries, stock options, stock incentive and bonus proposals for our employees (if any). Acting in its audit committee function, the Board reviews, with our independent accountants, our annual financial statements prior to publication, and reviews the work of, and approves non-audit services performed by, such independent accountants. The Board appoints the independent public accountants for the ensuing year. The Board also reviews the effectiveness of the financial and accounting functions and the organization, operation and management of our Company. Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports The following table identifies each person who, at any time during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, was a director, executive officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10 of our common stock that failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year: Name Number of Late Reports Number of Transactions Not Reported on a Timely Basis Reports Not Filed Dr. Jon Leonard 0 0 0 David LaMountain 0 0 0 Timothy Holly 0 0 0 17 Table of Contents Code of Ethics We do not currently have a Code of Ethics, because we have only limited business operations, have a limited number of officers and directors, and believe a Code of Ethics would, at the present time, have limited utility. We intend to adopt such a Code of Ethics as our business operations expand and we have more directors, officers and employees. Procedure for Nominating Directors We have not made any material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. The board does not have a written policy or charter regarding how director candidates are evaluated or nominated for the board. Additionally, the board has not created particular qualifications or minimum standards that candidates for the board must meet. Instead, the board considers how a candidate could contribute to the Company's business and meet the needs of the Company and the board. Indemnification Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware. Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Delaware law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. Item 11. Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Except for the employment agreement for CEO Dr. Jon N Leonard described below, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no salary, bonus or other compensation was awarded or earned. However, Jon Leonard was partially paid his accrued salary. Payments to him during 2022 amounted to 22,000. We intend to adopt a compensation plan for executive officers when we have positive and stable cash flows for the purpose of: (a) attracting and retaining talented executive officers who can assist with our business strategy; (b) aligning the interests of those executive officers with those of the Company; and (c) linking individual compensation to the performance of the Company. Any such plan that we may adopt will be designed to provide compensation that is both in line with our fiscal resources and competitive with companies at a similar stage of development. The elements of compensation to be awarded to, earned by, paid to, or payable to our executive officers are currently expected to be composed of: (i) base salary (or consulting fees); (ii) option-based awards; and (iii) cash bonuses or share-based awards for exceptional performance that results in a significant increase in stockholder value. 18 Table of Contents Base salary will be a fixed element of compensation payable to executive officers for performing the specific duties of their respective positions. The amount of base salary for each executive officer will be reviewed and set annually by the Board of Directors. While base salary is intended to fit into our overall compensation objectives by serving to attract and retain talented executive officers, the size of the Company and the nature and stage of its business will also impact the level of base salary. We intend to use option-based awards as a variable element of compensation to attract and reward talented executives and professionals. Option-based awards are intended fit into our overall compensation objectives by aligning the interests of executive officers with those of the Company and linking individual compensation to its performance. The Board of Directors will be responsible for setting and amending any equity incentive plan under which an option based award would be granted. Previous grants of stock options will be taken into account when considering new grants. We intend to award bonuses at our sole discretion and do not have any pre-existing performance criteria or objectives. At this time we do not provide medical, dental, pension or other benefits to our executive officers. Employment Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with Dr. Jon Leonard, the Company s Chief Executive Officer at a compensation rate of 60,000 and six weeks per year of paid vacation. Payment and vacation benefits began to accrue in June, 2019. Other than the agreement in the previous paragraph, there are no employment agreements or arrangements, whether written or unwritten, between the Company and any of its executive officers. We do not contemplate entering into any other employment agreements with our executive officers until the Company has positive and stable cash flows. Incentive Plans The Company does not have any plan or arrangement providing compensation to executive officers or directors intended to serve as an incentive for performance to occur over any period. Equity Compensation Plans The Company does not have any stock option plans, stock appreciation rights or any other plan, contract, authorization or arrangement pursuant to which the executive officers or directors of the Company may receive equity-based compensation for their services to the Company. Outstanding Equity Awards No executive officer or director of the Company had any unexercised option, stock that had not vested or equity incentive plan award as at the end of the Company s last completed fiscal year. 19 Table of Contents Pension and Retirement Plans The Company does not have any plan or arrangement by which to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits to its executive officers or directors, and we do not currently intend to offer such any such plan or arrangement until we have positive and stable cash flows Termination, Resignation or Change of Control The Company is not a party to any contract or agreement, and has not entered into any plan or arrangement that may provide for payment to an executive officer or a director at, following, or in connection with the resignation, retirement or other termination of an executive officer or director, or a change of control of the Company or a change in the responsibilities of an executive officer following a change of control. Compensation of Directors The members of the Board of Directors do not receive compensation for their services as directors, but they are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of our board of directors. We may pay cash compensation to an executive officer who is also a director, but only in his or her capacity as an executive officer. We do not currently have an established policy to provide compensation to directors for their services in that capacity. Director Independence Our Board of Directors has determined that none of our directors is independent as defined under the standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. In making this determination, the Board of Directors considered all transactions set forth in the section titled Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, elsewhere in this prospectus. 20 Table of Contents Item 12.
