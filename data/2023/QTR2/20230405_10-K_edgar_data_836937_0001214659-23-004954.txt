and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this report. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
and the Company assumes no obligation to update this information. Therefore, the actual experience of the Company and the results
achieved during the period covered by any particular projections or forward-looking statements may differ substantially from those projected.
 The inclusion of projections and other forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any
other person that these estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially. There can be no assurance
that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate.

Prior Business History 

Record Street Brewing Company Craft
Beer Business 

On December 31, 2017, we closed on an
Agreement of Exchange and Plan of Reorganization with Record Street Brewing Co. RSB ), a Nevada corporation RSB ),
which required us to issue 80,000,000 of our restricted common stock shares to RSB s 4 shareholders for all of RSB s outstanding
capital stock. We purchased RSB to pursue the craft beer business. 

On December 31, 2020, we discontinued
RSB s operations pursuant to an Assumption Agreement between us and RSB whereby 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock
of RSB was assigned to RSB s co-founder/beneficial owner, the purchaser agreed to assume RSB s outstanding liabilities of
 251,164, and RSB acquired the rights to all royalties associated with the intellectual property licensing we previously held. During
the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, RSB did not engage in material operations or generate material revenues. 

RSB's business model was based upon
a contract brewer and U.S. west coast distribution model that was permanently impacted by the loss of both its contract brewer and its
statewide California distributor in close time proximity. In connection therewith, , RSB's original contract brewer, Mendocino Brewing
Company, filed for bankruptcy and ceased to provide contract brewing services, and RSB's California distributor, Young's Market Company,
LLC, exited the beer distribution business in California. RSB s efforts to replace those vendors, however, were unsuccessful, and
we determined that it was in our best interests to exit the adult beverage business in favor of the health and wellness business. 

iMetabolic Corporation Weight Loss and Weight Management
Products 

On July 1, 2013, we formed iMetabolic Corporation IMET in Nevada for the purpose of marketing products under the brand iMetabolic that previously were sold
by the brand s licensor, International Metabolic Institute LLC IMI ), as well trademark rights to IMET on July 22,
2013 (the License ). The License was amended on March 16, 2015 to clarify IMET s and IMI s future rights.
IMI produced a line of weight loss and weight management products, including, but not limited to, proprietary blend meal replacements,
dietary specialty foods, and nutraceuticals, which are sold at IMI s company store and doctors offices pursuant to a reservation
of rights by IMI in the License and on IMI s website at www.imetabolic.com. On October 5, 2021, pursuant to a termination
agreement with IMET, we terminated IMI s business and the license.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS 
REHABILITATION SERVICES 

The Lexington, Kentucky Lease and Lease
Cancellation 

On January 14, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary,
United Product Development Corporation, entered into a commercial lease with Athens Commons, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company,
for the lease of a 88,740 square foot building at 5532 Athens Boonsboro Road, Lexington, Kentucky (the Lexington Lease ).
The Lexington Lease is for a 5-year term with options to renew for 2 additional 5-year terms. The effective beginning date of the Lexington
Lease term was January 14, 2021. The Lexington Lease provides for minimum monthly rent of 50,000 for the first lease year and a 3 rental
increase for each succeeding lease year. We were only obligated to pay 20,000 per month for up to the first six months until the property
was re-zoned and licensed for our planned rehabilitation operations. The Lexington Lease has an option to cancel the lease during the
first six months if it is unable to obtain re-zoning approval and applicable regulatory licensing. 

On May 20, 2021, the Company terminated the Lexington
Lease due to zoning and licensing challenges associated with the facility. 

The Frankfort, Kentucky Lease 

On November 18, 2020, VBH Frankfort as the tenant
entered into a commercial lease (the Frankfort Lease with Kell Properties, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company, for
the lease of 4,015 square feet of office space in Units B, C, and D of 915 Leawood Dr, Frankfort, Kentucky (i.e., the Frankfort Facility).
The term of the Frankfort Lease is twenty-four months with no explicit extension options. The base monthly payment of the term of the
Frankfort Lease is 2,365. The Frankfort Lease commenced on February 1, 2021 and was assigned to VBH Kentucky, effective as of April 1,
2021. VBH Kentucky intends to develop the Frankfort Facility for the purpose of operating an outpatient substance abuse treatment facility
On August 26, 2021, our Non-Hospital-based Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Entity AODE was approved by the Kentucky Office
of the Inspector General. 

The Fayetteville, Georgia Lease 

VBH Georgia Inc. leased a facility in Fayetteville,
Georgia beginning August 1, 2021 with an initial base rent of 13,617 per month for an initial term of 18 months with a 5-year extension
option. The facility is intended be used for in-patient services upon the receipt of regulatory approval. The Company estimated the lease
liability associated with the facility using a discount rate of 7.7 . The discount rate is based on an estimate of the Company s
incremental borrowing rate for a term similar to the lease term on the commencement date. 

Business of Vital Behavioral Health, Inc. 

Vital s operational plans are contingent upon whether we are
able to: 

Obtain sufficient debt or equity financing to operate U.S. substance abuse facilities. 

Secure leases for the substance abuse facilities. 

Secure and have approved the required state licenses to operate the substance abuse facilities. 

Meet applicable zoning requirements. 

Upon our acquisition of Vital we became a health
and wellness company with a focus in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation services industry. Vital intends to operate U.S. facilities focusing
on substance abuse treatment and offer various programs that help provide a continuum of care to its patients. We intend to become a national
operator of clinical and transitional housing services for clients affected by substance use disorders and co-occurring disorders. Our
treatment plans will be based on an individualized approach and will be customized to meet each client s specific needs. 

The facilities we intend to operate
have access to Medically Monitored Withdrawal Management Services (MMWM), a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), an Intensive Outpatient
Program (IOP), and an Outpatient Program (OP). Clients who participate in the PHP, IOP, and OP treatment programs will be eligible for
housing through sober living accommodations that will be designed to give a client the ability to participate in his or her daily affairs
and work and to have access to daily on-campus treatment at convenient times and locations. 

We intend that our treatment facilities
will be enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid and will bill and accept payments from those governmental programs. In most cases, it takes between
45 and 90 days for a Medicaid application to be processed and either accepted or denied by the state Medicaid office. However, depending
on the circumstances and the state in which one resides, the application process could be shorter or longer. Most facilities that accept
Medicaid generally provide programs with some degree of medical care and substance rehabilitation, including group and individual therapy,
12-step meetings, and other recovery activities, on a 24 hours per day basis in a highly structured setting. Short-term programs may last
between 3 and 6 weeks and be followed by outpatient therapy. Long-term programs often last between 6 and 12 months and focus on re-socializing
patients as they prepare to re-enter their communities. Intensive outpatient services (IOPs) typically offer at least 9 hours of therapy
per week in sets of three 3-hour sessions, and some studies have found them to be similar to residential and inpatient programs in both
services and effectiveness. 

5 

 Table of Contents 

Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs)
provide care for people who need a more comprehensive level of treatment than standard or intensive outpatient. These programs typically
consist of approximately 20 hours a week of treatment and may include vocational and educational counseling, family therapy, medically
supervised use of medications, and treatment of co-occurring disorders. IOPs may also offer these services, but the time commitment of
a PHP typically is greater. 

We will offer both IOP and PHP services
at our facilities and accept Medicare and Medicaid payor-qualified patients and clients. 

VSL Frankfort intends to offer sober-designated
living quarters for individuals who are in recovery. Operations for VSL Frankfort are intended to commence once VBH Kentucky obtains the
operating entitlements for its outpatient substance use treatment facility in Frankfort, Kentucky. Until such time, VSL Frankfort s
operations will be limited to planning and preparation. 

All of our plans reflected above and below are
contingent upon receiving adequate debt and/or equity financing of which there are no assurances we will be successful in obtaining. 

Our Future Services and Solutions 

We intend to provide quality, comprehensive, and
compassionate care to adults struggling with alcohol and/or drug abuse and dependence as well as co-occurring mental health issues. We
will maintain a research-based, disciplined treatment plan for all patients with schedules designed to engage the patient in an enriched
recovery experience. Our purpose and passion is to empower the individual, their families, and the broader community through the promotion
of optimal wellness of the mind, body, and spirit. 

We plan to offer the following types of therapy:
motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, solution-focused
therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and systematic family intervention. Our variety of therapy settings includes individual,
group, and family therapies, recovery-oriented challenge therapies, expressive therapies (with a focus on music and art), and trauma therapies. 

We also intend to provide Medicated-Assisted Treatment MAT ), which is the use of FDA-approved medications, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide
a whole-patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders. We believe that it is particularly effective for treating
certain conditions such as opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and tobacco use disorder. The use of MAT has been shown to
significantly reduce overdoses from opioids and to improve long-term abstinence. 

Considering the high level of co-occurring substance
abuse, mental health, and medical conditions, we will offer patients a spectrum of psychiatric, medical, and wellness-focused services
based upon individual needs as assessed through comprehensive evaluations at admission and throughout participation in the program. To
maximize the likelihood of long-term recovery, all program levels will provide patients access to the following services: assessment of
individual substance abuse, mental health, medical history, and physical condition promptly upon admission; psychiatric evaluations; psychological
evaluations, and services based on patient needs; follow-up appointments with physicians and psychiatrists; medication monitoring; educational
classes regarding health risks, nutrition, smoking cessation, HIV awareness, life skills, healthy nutritional programs, and dietary plans;
access to fitness facilities; interactive wellness activities; and structured daily schedules designed for restorative sleep patterns. 

We plan to emphasize clinical treatment, as well
as the therapeutic value of overall physical and nutritional wellness. We are committed to providing fresh and nutritious meals throughout
a patient s stay in order to promote healthy routines, beginning with diet and exercise. Our facilities will offer comprehensive
work-out facilities either on-site or within walking distance, as well as various exercise classes and other amenities. We will support
long-term recovery for patients through research-based methodologies and individualized treatment planning while utilizing 12-step programs,
which are a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery. 

We plan to have a differentiated ability to manage
dual diagnosis cases and coordinate treatment of individuals suffering from the common combination of mental illness and substance abuse
simultaneously. These patients participate in education and discussion-oriented groups designed to provide information regarding the psychiatric
disorders that co-occur with chemical dependency. 

We plan to have a strong emphasis on tracking
patient satisfaction scores in order to measure our patient and staff interaction and overall outcome and reputation. In addition to patient
satisfaction surveys that we will receive after a patient s discharge, we also will solicit feedback during a patient s stay
at our inpatient facilities. This allows us to further tailor an individual s treatment plan to emphasize the programs that have
been more impactful to a particular patient. 

We believe in tracking clinical outcomes. We intend
to track and measure patient outcomes in order to drive continual improvement in our programs.

 Table of Contents 

We plan to offer a full spectrum of treatment
services to patients based upon individual needs that are assessed through comprehensive evaluations at admission and throughout their
participation in the program. The assignment and frequency of services will correspond to individualized treatment plans within the context
of the level of care and treatment intensity level. 

Detoxification detox . Detoxification is usually conducted at an inpatient
facility for patients with physical or psychological dependence. Detoxification services are designed to clear toxins out of the body
so that the body can safely adjust and heal itself after being dependent upon a substance. Patients are medically monitored 24 hours per
day, seven days per week, by experienced medical professionals who work to alleviate withdrawal symptoms through medication, as appropriate.
We plan to provide detoxification services for several substances including alcohol, sedatives, and opiates. 

Residential Treatment . Residential care is a structured treatment approach designed to prepare
patients to return to the general community with a sober lifestyle, increased functionality, and improved overall wellness. Treatment
is provided on a 24 hours per day, seven days per week basis, and services generally include a minimum of two individual therapy sessions
per week, regular group therapy, family therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups, exercise (if cleared by medical staff), case
management, and recreational activities. Medical and psychiatric care will be available to all patients, as needed, through our planned
contracted professional physician groups. 

Partial Hospitalization . Partial hospitalization is a structured program providing
care a minimum of 20 hours per week. This program is designed for patients who are stable enough physically and psychologically to participate
in everyday activities but who still require a degree of medical monitoring. Services include a minimum of weekly individual therapy,
regular group therapy, family education and family therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups, exercise (if cleared by medical staff),
case management, and off-site recovery meetings and activities. Medical and psychiatric care will be available to all patients, as needed,
through our planned contracted professional physician groups. 

Intensive Outpatient Services . Less intensive than the aforementioned levels of care,
intensive outpatient services are comprised of a structured program providing care three days per week for three hours per day at a minimum.
Designed as a step down from partial hospitalization, this program reinforces progress and assists in the attainment of
sobriety, reduction of detrimental behaviors, and improved overall wellness of patients while they integrate and interact in the community.
Services include weekly individual therapy, group therapy, family education and family therapy, didactic and psycho-educational groups,
case management, off-site recovery meetings and activities, and intensive transitional and aftercare planning. 

Outpatient Services . Traditional outpatient services are delivered in regularly scheduled
sessions, usually less the nine hours per week. Outpatient services include professionally directed screening, assessment, therapy, and
other services designed to support successful transition to the community and long-term recovery. These services are tailored to a person s
specific needs and stage of recovery and may involve many modalities, including motivational enhancement, family therapy, educational
groups, occupational and recreational therapy, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy. 

Ancillary Services . In addition to our inpatient and outpatient treatment services,
we intend to provide medical monitoring for adherence to addiction treatment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, and physician services
to our patients through our contracted laboratories and professional physician groups. We believe toxicological monitoring of patients
is an important component of substance abuse treatment. Patients are evaluated for illicit substances upon admission and thereafter on
a random basis and as otherwise determined to be medically necessary by the treating physician. 

Sober Living Facilities . We plan to provide sober living arrangements that serve as
an interim environment for patients transitioning from inpatient treatment centers to lower levels of care and eventually back to their
former living arrangements. Sober living facilities enable us to utilize existing beds for patients requiring higher levels of care, while
still providing housing for patients completing outpatient treatment programs. We provide sober living arrangements to patients through
our owned and leased properties in Texas, Nevada, Mississippi, and Florida. We plan to continue using sober living facilities as a complement
to our outpatient services.

Business Strategies 

Vital plans to hire highly trained and
experienced clinical staff to deploy research-based treatment programs with structured curricula for detoxification, inpatient treatment,
partial hospitalization, and intensive outpatient care. By keeping the majority of its treatment facilities and housing on campuses that
are conveniently located within walking distance to traditional community services, we are striving to create so-called sober cities 
in the United States that will nurture its clients development at all stages from detox to long-term self-sufficiency. By applying
a tailored treatment program based on the individual needs of each patient, many of whom require treatment for a co-occurring mental health
disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, we believe we will offer the level of quality care and service necessary
for our patients to achieve and maintain sobriety. Development of our business and the Vital Behavioral Health and Vital Sober
Living national brands is contingent upon our ability to raise sufficient funds to fund hiring clinical experts, leasing facilities,
and hiring professional staff, and national sales and marketing programs. We will engage the following strategies: 

Clinical excellence and outcomes-driven treatment. Our operations require us to comply with the
national standard for quality and sustainable outcomes in addiction treatment and to ongoing measurement and transparency regarding patient
outcomes. In addition to measurement of patient outcomes and satisfaction with treatment, we plan to advance utilization of modern, evidence-based
interventions that address addiction as a chronic brain disease, as supported by the science. 

Improve census over time at existing facilities. We plan to connect with potential patients through
a multi-faceted program that involves education about the disease of addiction and the development of relationships with healthcare professionals,
digital marketing, as well as such traditional channels as television, radio and print advertising. We plan to will take a consultative,
empathetic approach in operating our admissions department to allow our personnel to effectively identify and enroll patients who may
benefit from our treatment service offerings. 

Target complementary growth opportunities. We plan to pursue growth opportunities that are complementary
to our business, including providing laboratory services to other substance abuse treatment providers and expanding other ancillary services. 

Develop outpatient operations. We plan to selectively pursue opportunities to add outpatient centers
to complement our broader network of inpatient treatment facilities. We believe expanding our reach by developing or acquiring premium
outpatient facilities of a quality consistent with our inpatient services will further enhance our brand and our ability to provide a
more comprehensive suite of services across the spectrum of care. 

Opportunistically diversify our portfolio of treatment facilities. We intend to selectively seek
acquisition opportunities to expand and diversify our geographic presence, service offerings, and the portion of the population that can
access our services based on their individual healthcare coverage We believe that most mental health and substance abuse treatment companies
in operation are small, regional operations and this high level of fragmentation presents us with the opportunity to acquire facilities
or small providers and create economies of scale and enhanced patient care. All of the above plans are contingent upon adequate funding
of which there are no assurances. 

Sales and Marketing 

We intend to use a multi-faceted approach to reach
potential patients suffering from the disease of addiction and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. This multi-pronged approach will include: 

National Marketing Force. We intend to deploy and manage a team of representatives that will focus
on developing relationships with hospitals, other treatment facilities, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, employers, unions,
alumni, and employee assistance programs. Our sales representatives will educate these various constituents about the disease of addiction
and the variety of treatment services that we provide. 

Multi-Media Marketing. Through comprehensive online directories of treatment providers, treatment
provider reviews, user content that discusses the disease of addiction, treatment and recovery, as well as discussion forums and professional
communities, our future addiction-related websites will serve families and individuals who are struggling with addiction and seeking treatment
options. Additionally, we plan to pursue advertising opportunities in television commercials, radio spots, newspaper articles, medical
journals, and other print media that promote our facilities and have the intent to build our integrated, national brand.

Recommendations by Alumni. We anticipate receiving new patients who are directly referred to our
facilities by our satisfied and supportive alumni, as well as their friends and families. As our national brand continues to grow and
our business continues to increase, we believe our alumni will become an increasingly important source of business for us. 

The extent that we are able to implement the foregoing
or even able to implement any of the foregoing sales and marketing plans are contingent upon adequate funding, of which there are no assurances. 

Admissions Center Operations 

We intend to maintain a 24-hours per day, seven
days per week, remote admissions center. Our centralized admissions center initially will be provided by a third party provider that will
focus on outreach and enrolling patients. As part of its role, the admissions center team will conduct benefits verification, handle initial
communication with insurance companies, complete patient intake screenings, consult with our clinicians where necessary regarding a potential
patient s specific medical or psychological condition, begin the pre-certification process for treatment authorization, help each
patient choose a proper treatment facility for his or her clinical and financial needs, and assist patients with arrangements and logistics. 

Professional Groups 

We plan to become affiliated with groups of physicians
and mid-level service providers that may provide certain professional services to our patients through professional services agreements
with certain of our treatment facilities (the Professional Groups ). Under the professional services agreements, the Professional
Groups may provide a physician to serve as medical director for the applicable facility. The Professional Groups may either bill the payor
for their services directly or be compensated by the treatment facility based on fair market value hourly rates. 

Competition 

Our competitors have
greater assets, revenues, operational resources and financial resources than we do. The market for mental health and substance abuse treatment
facilities is highly fragmented with approximately 15,163 different companies providing services to the adult and adolescent population,
of which only 30 are operated by for-profit organizations (Source: IBISworld 2023 Data on Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities). Our
inpatient treatment facilities will compete with several national competitors and many regional and local competitors. Some of our competitors
are government entities that are supported by tax revenue, and others are non-profit entities that are primarily supported by endowments
and charitable contributions. We do not receive financial support from these sources. Some larger companies in our industry compete
with us on a national scale and offer substance use treatment services among other behavioral healthcare services. To a lesser extent,
we also compete with other providers of substance use treatment services, including other inpatient behavioral healthcare facilities and
general acute care hospitals. 

We believe the primary competitive factors affecting
our business include: 

quality of clinical programs and services; 

reputation and brand recognition; 

overall aesthetics of the facilities; 

amenities offered to patients; 

relationships with payors and referral sources; 

sales and marketing capabilities; 

information systems and proprietary data analytics; 

senior management experience; and 

national scope of operations. 

Legal Proceedings 

There are no legal actions currently threatened
or pending against us, our subsidiaries, or the Vital Subsidiaries.

Research and Development 

We did not incur any research and development
expenditures over the last two fiscal years or since our inception. 

Revenues 

We plan to generate revenues through our Vital
Behavioral Health operations from behavioral health treatment services at our inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities, which will
be derived from personally funded patients (i.e., private payor), insurance companies (e.g., United Healthcare and Blue Cross and Blue
Shield), and government program payors (e.g., Medicaid and Medicare) that act as the primary payment or reimbursement source of funds
for our patient services. We also plan to generate revenues through our Vital Sober Living operations as a landlord through the
provision of sober living residences that are supported by our Vital Behavioral Health patient services. Initially, we expect that
our revenue-producing operations will commence in Frankfort, Kentucky. 

Intellectual Property 

We have no registered patents, trademarks, or
other intellectual property. 

Dependence On One or a Few Major Customers

We do not anticipate being depending upon any
one or a few major customers since our facilities will accommodate multiple patients. 

Seasonality of Business 

Seasonality does not materially affect our business. 

Government Regulations 

Introduction 

Healthcare service providers are required to comply
with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels, including: 

licensure, certification and accreditation of substance use treatment services; 

licensure, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certification and accreditation of
laboratory services;

 Table of Contents 

Substance abuse treatment providers are regulated
extensively at the federal, state, and local levels. In order to operate our business and obtain reimbursement from third-party payors,
we must obtain and maintain a variety of licenses, permits, certifications, and accreditations. We also must comply with numerous other
laws and regulations applicable to the provision of substance abuse disorder services. Our facilities also are subject to periodic on-site
inspections by the regulatory and accreditation agencies in order to determine our compliance with applicable requirements. 

The laws and regulations that affect substance
abuse treatment providers are complex and change frequently. We must regularly review our organization and operations and make changes
as necessary to comply with changes in the law or new interpretations of laws or regulations. In recent years, significant public attention
has focused on the healthcare industry, including attention to the conduct of industry participants and the cost of healthcare services.
Federal and state government agencies have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts relating to the healthcare
industry. The ongoing investigations relate to, among other things, referral practices, cost reporting, billing practices, credit balances,
physician ownership, and joint ventures involving hospitals and other healthcare providers. Recently, federal and state governmental officials
have focused on fraud and abuse in the addiction treatment industry. In particular, new laws and regulations have been passed in recent
years that are intended to prohibit the payment of kickbacks, bribes, and other inducements in exchange for referrals of patients to treatment
providers, including residential treatment centers and outpatient programs. We expect that healthcare costs and other factors will continue
to encourage both the development of new laws and regulations and increased enforcement activity, including among substance abuse treatment
providers. 

While we believe we are in substantial compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any material pending or threatened investigations involving allegations
of wrongdoing, there can be no assurances of compliance. Compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to future government
review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from government health programs. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

We are subject to various federal, state, and
local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects,
such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of medical and pharmaceutical waste products generated at our facilities,
the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection
with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources
from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate
workplace safety, including the safety of workers who may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, the hepatitis B virus, and
the hepatitis C virus. Our laboratory and some of our treatment facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to
the illness or physical condition of our patients and in connection with performing laboratory tests. The management of infectious medical
waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state, and local environmental laws that establish management requirements for such
waste. These requirements include recordkeeping, notice, and reporting obligations. Management believes that our operations are generally
in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements or that any non-compliance will not result in a material
liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations
at our facilities, including our laboratory, have not been material. 

A CLIA certificate demonstrates that a testing
laboratory meets the federal regulations for clinical diagnostic testing, ensuring quality and safety in the laboratory and laboratory
results. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 are administered by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS). 

The United States has recently enacted the Eliminating
Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA) to create a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration
in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration
to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory.
Certain states, including Florida, have enacted similar laws, or will likely enact similar laws in the future.

Licensure, Accreditation, and Certification 

All of our substance abuse treatment facilities
will be licensed under applicable state laws where licensure is required. Licensing requirements vary significantly depending upon the
state in which a facility is located and the types of services provided. The types of licensed services that our facilities will provide
include medical detox, inpatient, partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient, outpatient treatment, ambulatory detox, and community
housing. In addition, our employed case managers, therapists, nurses, medical providers, and technicians may be subject to individual
state license requirements. 

Our facilities that store and dispense controlled
substances will be required to register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration DEA and abide by DEA regulations
regarding controlled substances. Each of our substance abuse treatment facilities will obtain accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation
of Rehabilitation Facilities CARF and/or The Joint Commission, which are the primary accreditation bodies in the substance
abuse treatment industry. This type of accreditation program is intended to improve the quality, safety, outcomes, and value of healthcare
services provided by accredited facilities. CARF and The Joint Commission require an initial application and completion of on-site surveys
demonstrating compliance with accreditation requirements. Accreditation is granted for a specified period, typically ranging from one
to three years, and renewals of accreditation require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey. 

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
of 1988 regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various
technical, operational, personnel, and quality requirements intended to ensure that laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable,
and timely. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the level of complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory. A CLIA certificate
of waiver may be sought by our treatment facilities that only perform the types of tests waived under CLIA, such as point-of-care drug
analysis, glucose monitoring, and pregnancy testing. 

We will contract with third-party clinical laboratory
facilities to perform high complexity testing. Each such laboratory will hold a CLIA certificate of accreditation, certifying that it
meets more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex testing. CLIA does not preempt state laws that may be more
stringent than federal law. State laws may require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency
testing. A number of states in which we intend to operate have implemented their own regulatory and licensure requirements. In addition,
some states require laboratories that solicit or test samples collected from individuals within that state to hold a laboratory license
even though the laboratory does not have physical operations within the state. 

We intend that all of our in-house and outside
contracted facilities and programs will be in substantial compliance with the then-current applicable state and local licensure, certification,
and accreditation requirements. Periodically, state and local regulatory agencies, as well as accreditation entities, will conduct surveys
of our facilities and may find that a facility is not in full compliance with all of the accreditation standards. Upon receipt of any
such finding, the facility will submit a plan of correction and remedy any cited deficiencies. 

FDA Laws and Regulations 

The Food and Drug Administration FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents, and other devices used by clinical laboratories
to perform diagnostic testing. We may develop esoteric tests that are offered as laboratory developed tests LDTs ). The
FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs but exercises enforcement discretion in not mandating FDA approval for most LDTs performed
by high complexity CLIA certified laboratories. The FDA released draft guidance in 2014 that would increase regulation of LDTs but has
indefinitely delayed finalizing the guidance. 

Fraud, Abuse and Self-Referral Laws 

We intend that most of our treatment facilities
will be enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid and bill and accept payments from those governmental programs. Therefore, the majority of our
operations will be impacted by the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the Anti-Kickback Statute, or
the federal prohibition on physician self-referrals, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. We expect that over the longer term, an increasing
number of our patients will be members of governmental health insurance programs and therefore, these rules and restrictions will increasingly
affect our operations. 

12 

 Table of Contents 

The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the payment,
receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under federal healthcare
programs. The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare providers that furnish certain
designated health services, including laboratory services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services, if the physicians or their immediate
family members have ownership interests in, or other financial arrangements with, the healthcare providers. Many states have anti-kickback
and physician self-referral prohibitions similar to the federal statutes and regulations. Some of these state laws are drafted broadly
to cover all payors (i.e., not restricted to Medicare and other federal healthcare programs), and they often lack interpretative guidance.
A violation of these laws could result in a prohibition on billing payors for such services, an obligation to refund amounts received,
or civil or criminal penalties and could adversely affect the state license of any program or facility found to be in violation. 

In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the
United States has recently enacted an addiction treatment-specific law known as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act EKRA ).
The EKRA created a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring
a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration to induce such a
referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction
under EKRA is punishable by up to 200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both. Unlike the Anti-Kickback
Statutes, EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government healthcare program. While EKRA contains certain exceptions similar
to the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors, those exceptions are narrower than the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors. As such, certain
practices that would not have violated the Anti-Kickback Statute may violate EKRA. 

Federal prosecutors have broad authority to prosecute
healthcare fraud. For example, federal law criminalizes the knowing and willful execution or attempted execution of a scheme or artifice
to defraud any healthcare benefit program as well as obtaining by false pretenses any money or property owned by any healthcare benefit
program. Federal law also prohibits embezzlement of healthcare funds, false statements relating to healthcare, and obstruction of the
investigation of criminal offenses. These federal criminal offenses are enforceable regardless of whether an entity or individual participates
in the Medicare program or any other federal healthcare program. 

False Claims 

We are subject to state and federal laws that
govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. These laws generally prohibit an individual or entity from knowingly and willfully
presenting a claim (or causing a claim to be presented) for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that is false
or fraudulent. The standard for knowing and willful often includes conduct that amounts to a reckless disregard for whether
accurate information is presented by claims processors. Penalties under these statutes include substantial civil and criminal fines, exclusion
from the Medicare program, and imprisonment. 

One of the most prominent of these laws is the
federal False Claims Act FCA ), which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff
(or whistleblower) on the government s behalf. When a private plaintiff brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant
often will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the amount
of the alleged false claim, plus mandatory civil penalties of between 11,181 and 22,363 for each separate false claim. These and
certain other civil monetary penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. 

Many states have passed false claims acts similar
to the FCA. Under these laws, the government may impose a penalty and recover damages, often treble damages, for knowingly submitting
or participating in the submission of claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or which contain false or misleading information.
These laws may be limited to specific programs (such as state workers compensation programs) or may apply to all payors. In many
cases, alleged violations of these laws may be brought by a whistleblower who may be an employee, a referring physician, a competitor,
a patient, or other individual or entity, and who may be eligible for a portion of any recovery. Further, like the federal law, state
false claims act laws generally protect employed whistleblowers from retribution by their employers. 

Although we believe that we have procedures in
place to ensure the accurate completion of claims forms and requests for payment, the laws, regulations, and standards defining proper
billing, coding, and claim submission are complex and have not been subjected to extensive judicial or agency interpretation. Billing
errors can occur despite our best efforts to prevent or correct them, and we cannot assure that the government or a payor will regard
such errors as inadvertent and not in violation of the applicable false claims act laws or related statutes.

Privacy and Security Requirements 

There are numerous federal and state regulations
that address the privacy and security of patient health information. In particular, federal regulations issued under the Drug Abuse Prevention,
Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1979 (known as the Part 2 Regulations restrict the disclosure of, and regulate the
security of, patient identifiable information related to substance abuse and apply to any of our facilities that receive federal assistance,
which is interpreted broadly to include facilities licensed, certified or registered by a federal agency. Further, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA ), extensively regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable
health information (known as protected health information and requires covered entities, which include most health providers,
to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security
requirements apply to electronic protected health information. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect
to their health information. 

The HIPAA privacy and security regulations and
the Part 2 Regulations also require our substance abuse treatment programs and facilities to impose compliance obligations by written
agreement on certain contractors to whom our programs disclose patient information known as business associates. Covered
entities may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA privacy and security regulations if the business
associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates also are directly subject to liability under the HIPAA privacy
and security regulations. In instances where our programs act as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for
additional liability beyond the program s covered entity status. 

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured
protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach
by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HHS ),
and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities
that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information
are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information
has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach
involving individually identifiable information without regard to whether there is a low probability of the information being compromised. 

With HHS s 2022 updates to penalty amounts,
violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil penalties of up to 60,973 per violation for a maximum civil
penalty of 1,919,173 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. These penalties will increase annually based on updates
to the consumer price index. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties of up to 250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties
for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer, or use such information for commercial advantage,
personal gain, or malicious harm. In addition, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in
response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS is required to
impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect and to perform compliance audits. 

Our programs remain subject to any privacy-related
federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. These laws vary by state and could impose
additional requirements and penalties. For example, some states impose restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information pertaining
to mental health or substance abuse treatment. The Federal Trade Commission also uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement
actions in response to data breaches or other privacy or security lapses. 

We intend to enforce a health information privacy
and security compliance plan that we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and other applicable requirements.
We may be required to make operational changes to comply with revisions made to the Part 2 Regulations that generally became effective
on August 14, 2020. 

Mental Health Legislation and Reform Efforts 

The regulatory framework in which we operate is
constantly changing. For example, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 MHPAEA ), is a federal parity
law that requires large group health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with
financial requirements and treatment limitations of coverage offered for other illnesses. The scope of coverage offered by health plans
must comply with federal and state laws and must be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice.
The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption that operates to temporarily exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA s requirements
if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly. 

14 

 Table of Contents 

The 21 st Century Cures Act Cures
Act ), enacted in 2016, requires development of an action plan for enhanced enforcement of mental health parity requirements and
additional compliance guidance for health plans regarding coverage under parity laws. Among other initiatives aimed at improving care
for people with mental health and substance use disorders, the Cures Act includes provisions intended to increase the healthcare workforce
dedicated to such treatment and expand programs that divert people with mental health and substance use disorders toward alternatives
to incarceration. However, the impact of the Cures Act largely depends on its implementation by agencies such as HHS and on future appropriations
by Congress. 

Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain
state legislatures have passed a large number of laws intended to result in extensive change to the healthcare industry. The Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively known as the Affordable
Care Act, is the most prominent of these legislative reform efforts. It resulted in reforms to the health insurance market and expansion
of public program coverage, among other changes. As currently structured, the law requires all non-grandfathered small group and individual
market health plans to cover ten essential health benefit categories, which currently include substance abuse addiction and mental health
disorder services. 

The Affordable Care Act poses both opportunities
and risks for us but, overall, the expansion of health insurance coverage under the law has been beneficial for the substance abuse treatment
industry. However, the overall and continued impact of the Affordable Care Act is difficult to determine, as the presidential administration
and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation
and its interpretation. For example, in October 2017, the president signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain
health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. In 2018, a federal district
court in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act, in its entirety, is invalid. That decision has been stayed pending appeal, and will
likely remain unresolved until finally decided by the United States Supreme Court. Further, effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated
the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate that was established by the Affordable Care Act. 

Addiction Treatment Legislation 

In October 2018, Congress enacted the Substance
Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the SUPPORT Act ).
The SUPPORT Act contains a number of provisions aimed at identifying at-risk individuals, increasing access to opioid abuse treatment,
reducing overprescribing, funding treatment related research, and promoting data sharing with the primary goal of reducing the use and
abuse of opioids. Most of the funding made available for treatment through the SUPPORT Act will be limited to patients covered by federal
healthcare programs such as Medicaid. The SUPPORT Act also contains an addiction treatment-specific law known as the Eliminating
Kickbacks in Recovery Act. 

Health Planning and Certificates of Need 

The construction of new healthcare facilities,
the expansion, transfer, or change of ownership of existing facilities and the addition of new beds, services, or equipment may be subject
to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies under certificate of need CON or determination
of need DON laws. These laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need for construction or acquisition
of facilities or the addition of new services. Review of CON or DON applications and other healthcare planning initiatives may be lengthy
and may require public hearings. Violations of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or revocation of a facility s
license. 

Other State Healthcare Laws 

Most states have a variety of laws that may potentially
impact our operations and business practices. For instance, many states in which our programs may operate prohibit corporations (and other
legal entities) from practicing medicine by employing physicians and certain non-physician practitioners. These prohibitions on the corporate
practice of medicine impact how our programs structure their relationships with physicians and other affected non-physician practitioners.
These arrangements, however, have typically not been vetted by either a court or the applicable regulatory body. 

Similarly, many states prohibit physicians from
sharing a portion of their professional fees with any other person or entity. These so-called fee-splitting prohibitions range from prohibiting
arrangements resembling a kickback to broadly prohibiting percentage-based compensation and other variable compensation arrangements with
physicians. 

15 

 Table of Contents 

If our arrangements with physicians are found
to violate a corporate practice of medicine prohibition or a state fee-splitting prohibition, our contractual arrangements with physicians
in such states could be adversely affected, which, in turn, may adversely affect both our operations and profitability. Further, we could
face sanctions for aiding and abetting the violation of the state s medical practice act. 

State governments have in recent years increased
regulation of addiction treatment providers. A number of states, such as Florida, have passed laws prohibiting patient brokering, which
broadly refers to the practice of paying or receiving kickbacks or other benefits in exchange for patient referrals. A number of these
statutes mirror federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Laws and, in some instances, the restrictions apply regardless of whether the payor source
is a governmental or commercial entity. Further, some state governments have passed statutes aimed at prohibiting deceptive online addiction
treatment marketing practices, such as the operation of websites and affiliated admission centers without disclosure to the caller about
existing financial arrangements to promote particular treatment centers. We expect that these kinds of regulations and restrictions to
increase. 

Local Land Use and Zoning 

Municipal and other local governments may also
regulate our treatment programs. Many of our facilities must comply with zoning and land use requirements in order to operate. For example,
local zoning authorities regulate not only the physical properties of a healthcare facility, such as its height and size, but also the
location and activities of the facility. In addition, community or political objections to the placement of treatment facilities can result
in delays in the land use permit process and may prevent the operation of facilities in certain areas. 

Risk Management and Insurance 

The healthcare industry in general continues to
experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. Like other providers of healthcare-related services, we
could be subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our patients or had other adverse effects. In addition, resident,
visitor and employee injuries could also subject us to the risk of litigation. While we believe that quality care is provided to our patients
and that we substantially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government
investigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Compliance Programs 

Compliance with government rules and regulations
is a significant concern throughout our industry, in part due to evolving interpretations of these rules and regulations. We seek to conduct
our business in compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations. Our executive management team is responsible
for the oversight and operation of our compliance program. We intent to provide periodic and comprehensive training programs to our personnel,
which are intended to promote the strict observance of our policies designed to ensure compliance with the statutes and regulations applicable
to us. 

Employees 

Effective as of July 1, 2021, we entered into
12 month consulting agreements with CEO Mark Conte and COO Patrick Ogle, providing for compensation of 5,000 per month to each officer
for public company administration and behavioral health treatment facility operations No directors were compensated in Fiscal Years 2020
or 2021. We do not currently have a formal plan for compensating our directors. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, VDH Kentucky,
Inc. has the following employees: 

7 Salary Employees 

4 Hourly Employees 

1 Director of Operations 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements are prepared
using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient
to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on
our company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital,
we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations.

 Table of Contents 

In its report on our financial statements
for the year ended June 30, 2022, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

We will need to raise additional funds
to finance continuing operations. However, there are no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional funds. Without sufficient
additional financing, it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in this report and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain
profitable operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Risks Related to Our Business 

Our revenue, profitability and cash flows
could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to operate certain key treatment facilities, our corporate office or our laboratory
facilities. 

We intend to derive a significant portion of our
revenue from our flagship treatment facilities located in Kentucky. It is likely that a small number of facilities will continue to contribute
a significant portion of our total revenue in any given year for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we have a centralized corporate
office that houses our accounting, billing and collections, information technology, and admissions center departments, centralized and
marketing offices. We also are building out a high complexity laboratory that will conduct quantitative drug testing and other laboratory
services. If any event occurs that results in a complete or partial shutdown of any of these facilities, our centralized corporate office,
our centralized marketing offices or laboratory, including, without limitation, any material changes in legislative, regulatory, economic,
environmental, or competitive conditions in these states or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or floods or
prolonged airline disruptions due to a natural disaster or for any reason, such event could lead to decreased revenue and/or higher operating
costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, and cash flows. 

Any disruption in our national sales and
marketing program, including our digital marketing resources, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

If any disruption occurs in our national sales
and marketing program for any reason, or if we are unable to effectively attract and enroll new patients to our network of facilities,
our ability to maintain census could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Internet search engines play an increasingly important
role in addiction treatment marketing. Google and other search engines use complex algorithms to rank websites. The algorithms take into
account many factors, including the domain name itself, website content and user-friendly factors such as the speed at which the website
pages may be clicked through and viewed. We cannot predict or control changes in algorithms and website rankings, which may result in
lower ranking search results for our websites. Additionally, Google and other online platforms have instituted review processes required
to advertise on their websites. Some of these processes are time-consuming, complex and continuously evolving. We cannot predict how these
private processes, rules and restrictions will evolve or be applied to individual advertising applicants. Unexpected changes in these
areas may result in a decrease in calls to our admissions center, a decrease in interactions with potential patients and a lowering of
our census, which could have and material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, our ability to grow or even to maintain
our existing level of business depends significantly on our ability to establish and maintain close working and referral relationships
with hospitals, other treatment facilities and clinicians, employers, alumni, employee assistance programs and other referral sources.
We have no binding commitments with any of these referral sources. We may not be able to maintain our existing referral relationships
or develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Negative changes to our existing referral relationships may cause
the number of people to whom we provide care to decrease, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

If reimbursement rates paid by third-party
payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, or
if third-party payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to patients, our business, financial condition and
results of operation could be adversely affected. This risk is heightened because we are generally an out-of-network provider. 

Managed care organizations and other third-party
payors pay for the services that we provide to many of our patients. We anticipate that approximately 90 or more of our revenue will
be reimbursable by third-party payors, including amounts paid by such payors to patients, with the remaining portion payable directly
by our patients. If any of these third-party payors reduce their reimbursement rates or elect not to cover some or all of our services,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

17 

 Table of Contents 

In addition to limits on the amounts payors will
pay for the services we provide to their members or participants, controls imposed by third-party payors designed to reduce admissions
and the length of stay for patients, including pre-admission authorizations and utilization review, have affected and are expected to
affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payors.
Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay, and occupancy rates are likely to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission
authorization and utilization review and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less
acutely ill patients. 

We believe that, generally, health insurance companies
have become more stringent and aggressive with respect to addiction treatment providers, taking measures that are putting pressure on
reimbursement rates, length of stay, and timing of reimbursement throughout the industry. We expect that payor efforts to impose more
stringent cost controls will continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes could have on our operations,
significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. If the rates paid or the scope of substance use treatment services covered by
third-party commercial payors are reduced, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. 

Third-party payors often use plan structures,
such as narrow networks or tiered networks, to encourage or require patients to use in-network providers. In-network providers typically
provide services through third-party payors for a negotiated lower rate or other less favorable terms. Third-party payors generally attempt
to limit use of out-of-network providers by requiring patients to pay higher copayment and/or deductible amounts for out-of-network care.
Additionally, third-party payors have become increasingly aggressive in attempting to minimize the use of out-of-network providers by
disregarding the assignment of payment from patients to out-of-network providers (i.e., sending payments directly to patients instead
of to out-of-network providers), capping out-of-network benefits payable to patients, waiving out-of-pocket payment amounts, and initiating
litigation against out-of-network providers for interference with contractual relationships, insurance fraud, and violation of state licensing
and consumer protection laws. The majority of third-party payors consider certain of our facilities to be out-of-network 
providers. If third-party payors continue to impose and to increase restrictions on out-of-network providers, our revenue could be threatened,
forcing our facilities to participate with third-party payors and accept lower reimbursement rates compared to our historic reimbursement
rates. 

Third-party payors also are entering into sole
source contracts with some healthcare providers, which could effectively limit our pool of potential patients. Moreover, third-party payors
are beginning to carve out specific services, including substance abuse treatment and behavioral health services, and establish small,
specialized networks of providers for such services at fixed reimbursement rates. Continued growth in the use of carve-out arrangements
could materially adversely affect our business to the extent we are not selected to participate in such smaller specialized networks or
if the reimbursement rate is not adequate to cover the cost of providing the service. 

If reimbursement rates paid by federal or
state healthcare programs are reduced or if government payors otherwise restrain our ability to obtain or provide services to patients,
our business, financial condition, and results of operation could be adversely affected. 

Managed care organizations and other third-party
payors, both government and commercial, pay for the services that we provide to many of our patients. We intend for a significant portion
of our revenues to come from government healthcare programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Payments from federal and state government
programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for
utilization review, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease program payments, as
well as affect the cost of providing service to patients and the timing of payments to facilities. 

We are unable to predict the effect of recent
and future policy changes on our operations. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon federal and state governments
as a result of, among other things, deterioration in general economic conditions and the funding requirements from the federal healthcare
reform legislation, may affect the availability of taxpayer funds for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Changes in government healthcare
programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

As federal healthcare expenditures continue to
increase, and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make,
significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These changes include reductions in reimbursement levels and to new or modified
demonstration projects authorized pursuant to Medicaid waivers. Some of these changes have decreased, or could decrease, the amount of
money we receive for our services relating to these programs. In some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare
payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively
impact payments from private third-party payers. 

In addition to limits on the amount payors will
pay for the services we provide to their members, government and commercial payors attempt to control costs by imposing controls designed
to reduce admissions and the length of stay for patients, including preadmission authorizations and utilization review. The ability of
governmental payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of insurance and
managed care companies and vertical integration of health insurers with healthcare providers. Although we are unable to predict the effect
these controls and changes could have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates
and fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the rates paid or the
scope of substance use treatment services covered by government payors are reduced, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.

If we overestimate the reimbursement amounts
that payors will pay us for out-of-network services performed, it would increase our revenue adjustments, which could have a material
adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, and cash flows and lead to significant shifts in our results of operations from quarter
to quarter that may make it difficult to project long-term performance. 

For out-of-network services, we recognize revenue
from payors at the time services are provided based on our estimate of the amount that payors will pay us for the services performed.
We estimate the net realizable value of revenue by adjusting gross patient charges using our expected realization and applying this discount
to gross patient charges. A significant or sustained decrease in our collection rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve historical collection rates in future reporting periods. 

Estimates of net realizable value are subject
to significant judgment and approximation by management. It is possible that actual results could differ from the historical estimates
management has used to help determine the net realizable value of revenue. If our actual collections either exceed or are less than the
net realizable value estimates, we will record a revenue adjustment, either positive or negative, for the difference between our estimate
of the receivable and the amount actually collected in the reporting period in which the collection occurred. A significant negative revenue
adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows in the reporting period in which such adjustment
is recorded. In addition, if we record a significant revenue adjustment, either positive or negative, in any given reporting period, it
may lead to significant changes in our results from operations from quarter to quarter, which may limit our ability to make accurate long-term
predictions about our future performance. 

Certain third-party payors are likely to
account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the reduction of reimbursement rates or coverage of services by any such payor could
have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability and cash flows. 

We intend that certain payors such as Medicaid
and Medicare will account for a significant portion of our revenue on an annual basis. If any of these or other third-party payors reduce
their reimbursement rates for the services we provide or otherwise implement measures, such as specialized networks, that reduce the payments
we receive, our revenue, profitability, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 

A deterioration in the collectability of
the accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The collection of receivables from third-party
payors and patients will be critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks are: (i) the risk of overestimating our
net revenue at the time of billing, which may result in us receiving less than the recorded receivable; (ii) the risk of non-payment as
a result of commercial insurance companies denying claims; (iii) in certain states, the risk that patients will fail to remit insurance
payments to us when the commercial insurance company pays out-of-network claims directly to the patient; and (iv) resource and capacity
constraints that may prevent us from handling the volume of billing and collection issues in a timely manner. Additionally, our ability
to hire and retain experienced personnel may affect our ability to bill and collect accounts in a timely manner. 

We intend to routinely review accounts receivable
balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions that might ultimately affect the collectability of the patient
accounts and to adjust our allowances as warranted. Significant changes in business operations, payor mix or economic conditions, including
changes resulting from legislation or other health reform efforts (including to repeal or significantly change the Affordable Care Act),
could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, future patient concentration in
states that permit commercial insurance companies to pay out-of-network claims directly to the patient instead of the provider, such as
California and Nevada, could adversely affect our collection of receivables. Unexpected changes in reimbursement rates by third-party
payors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our business depends
on our information systems. Failure to effectively integrate, manage, and keep our information systems secure could disrupt our operations
and have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our business depends on effective and secure information
systems that assist us in, among other things, admitting patients to our facilities, monitoring census and utilization, processing and
collecting claims, reporting financial results, measuring outcomes and quality of care, managing regulatory compliance controls, and maintaining
operational efficiencies. These systems may include software developed in-house and systems provided by external contractors and other
service providers. To the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software
or systems, our operations could be negatively affected. Our facilities also depend upon our information systems for electronic medical
records, accounting, billing, collections, risk management, payroll, and other information. If we experience a reduction in the performance,
reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate
reports could be adversely affected. 

19 

 Table of Contents 

Our information systems and applications require
continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement to meet our operational needs. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems 
capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain,
or expand our systems properly or in a timely manner, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems,
working capital disruptions, and increases in administrative expenses. 

In addition, we could be subject to cybersecurity
risks such as a cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology security systems and other security incidents that result in security
breaches, including the theft, loss, destruction, or misappropriation of individually identifiable health information subject to HIPAA
and other privacy and security laws, proprietary business information, or other confidential or personal data. Such an incident could
disrupt our information technology systems, impede clinical operations, cause us to incur significant investigation and remediation expenses,
and subject us to litigation, government inquiries, penalties, and reputational damages. Information security and the continued development,
maintenance, and enhancement of our safeguards to protect our systems, data, software, and networks are a priority for us. As security
threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify and enhance our safeguards and investigate
and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks may also impede our ability to exercise sufficient disclosure controls.
If we are subject to cyberattacks or security breaches, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
impacted. 

Further, our information systems are vulnerable
to damage or interruption from fire, flood, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, and similar events. A
failure to implement our disaster recovery plans or ultimately restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the confidential health
information that we store and transmit, loss, theft or destruction of electronically-stored information for any reason could expose us
to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, liability to patients and other losses. 

Our acquisition strategy exposes us to a
variety of operational, integration, and financial risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

An element of our business strategy is to grow
by acquiring other companies and assets in the mental health and substance abuse treatment industry. We evaluate potential acquisition
opportunities consistent with the normal course of our business. Our ability to complete acquisitions is subject to a number of risks
and variables, including our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable terms with the counterparties, our ability to finance the purchase
price and our ability to obtain any licenses or other approvals required to operate the assets to be acquired. We may not be successful
in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, which may impede our growth and negatively affect our results of operations, and
may also require a significant amount of management resources. In addition, rapid growth through acquisitions exposes us to a variety
of operational and financial risks. We summarize the most significant of these risks below. 

We may be subject to Integration Risks 

We must integrate our acquisitions with our existing
operations. This process involves various components of our business and the businesses we have acquired, including the following: 

physicians and employees who are not familiar with our operations; 

patients who may elect to switch to another substance abuse treatment provider; 

assignment or termination of material contracts, including commercial payor agreements; 

regulatory compliance programs and state and federal licensing requirements; and 

disparate operating, information and record keeping systems and technology platforms. 

The integration of acquisitions with our operations
could be expensive, require significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects,
and may impose challenges on the combined business including, without limitation, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies,
business cultures, internal controls, and compliance. In addition, certain acquisitions require a capital outlay, and the return we achieve
on such invested capital may be less than the return that we could achieve on other projects or investments. 

Expected benefits of acquisitions may not materialize.

When evaluating potential acquisition targets,
we identify potential synergies and cost savings that we expect to realize upon the successful completion of the acquisition and the integration
of the related operations. We may, however, be unable to achieve or may otherwise never realize the expected benefits. Our ability to
realize the expected benefits from potential cost savings and revenue improvement opportunities is subject to significant business, economic,
and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Such uncertainties may include changes to regulations impacting the
substance abuse treatment and behavioral healthcare industries, reductions in reimbursement rates from third-party payors, operating difficulties,
difficulties obtaining required licenses and permits, patient preferences, changes in competition, and general economic or industry conditions.
If we do not achieve our expected results, it may adversely impact our results of operations. 

20 

 Table of Contents 

Assumptions of unknown liabilities may adversely
affect our business 

Businesses that we acquire may have unknown or
contingent liabilities, including, without limitation, liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations. Although
we typically attempt to exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers of
such facilities for at least a portion of these matters, we may experience difficulty enforcing those indemnification obligations, or
we may incur material liabilities in excess of any indemnification for the past activities of acquired facilities. Such liabilities and
related legal or other costs and/or resulting damage to a facility s reputation could negatively impact our business. 

We may be subject to additional acquisition
risks. 

Suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished
due to unfavorable terms. Further, the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending
on various factors, including the amount paid for an acquired facility, the acquired facility s results of operations, the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, effects of subsequent legislation, and limits on reimbursement rate increases. In addition,
we may have to pay cash, incur additional debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, which could adversely affect
our financial results, result in dilution to our existing stockholders, result in increased fixed obligations, or impede our ability to
manage our operations. 

We may encounter risks associated with managing
our growth, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 

 Some of the facilities we may acquire in the future
either had or may have significantly lower operating margins than the facilities we operated prior to the time of our acquisition thereof
or had or may have operating losses prior to such acquisition. If we fail to improve the operating margins of the facilities we acquire,
operate such facilities profitably, or effectively integrate the operations of acquired facilities, our results of operations could be
negatively impacted. 

Liquidity risk could impair our ability
to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due, and our funding sources may be insufficient to fund our future operations
and growth. 

Liquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity
risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding.
An inability to obtain such funding, at competitive rates or at all, could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access
to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that
affect us specifically or the healthcare industry or economy in general. 

Any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change
in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our future operations and growth, which
could have a material adverse effect on our assets, business, cash flow, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects and
results of operations. 

The uncertainties associated with the factors
described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order for us to continue operations beyond
the next twelve months and to be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must do some or
all of the following: (i) increase the bed counts and other capacities at our facilities; (ii) increase gross revenues while improving
operating margins through cost savings initiatives; and (iii) obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able
to achieve any or all of the foregoing objectives. 

We will need additional financing to execute
our long-term business plan and fund operations, at which time additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. 

To fund our acquisition development and operational
strategies, we may consider raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our common or preferred
stock and the procurement of commercial debt financing. However, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand or continue our business
as desired and operating results may be adversely affected. Any debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of
operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds,
the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net
book value per share. 

21 

 Table of Contents 

Our ability to obtain needed financing may be
impaired by such factors as the capital markets, both generally and specifically in our industry, which could impact the availability
or cost of future financings. Any deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding, and
we cannot be certain that we will have access to adequate capital to fund our acquisition and development strategies when needed. In addition,
substantial sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital.
If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenue from operations, is not sufficient
to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to decrease the pace of, or eliminate, our acquisition strategy and potentially reduce
or even cease operations. 

Our business may face significant risks
with respect to future de novo expansion, including the time and costs of identifying new geographic markets, the ability to obtain necessary
licensure and other zoning or regulatory approvals and significant start-up costs including advertising, marketing, and the costs of providing
equipment, furnishings, supplies, and other capital resources. 

As part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop
new substance abuse treatment facilities in existing and new markets, either by building a new facility or by acquiring an existing facility
with an alternative use and repurposing it as a substance abuse treatment facility. Such de novo expansion involves significant
risks, including, but not limited to, the following: 

the time and costs associated with identifying locations in suitable geographic markets, which may divert
management attention from existing operations; 

the possibility of changes to comprehensive zoning plans or zoning regulations that imposes additional
restrictions on use or requirements, which could impact our expansion into otherwise suitable geographic markets; 

the need for significant advertising and marketing expenditures to attract patients; 

our ability to provide each de novo facility with the appropriate equipment, furnishings, materials,
supplies, and other capital resources; 

our ability to obtain licensure and accreditation, establish relationships with healthcare providers in
the community, and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems; 

the costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local physicians, management, and staff, and opening
new facilities, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient revenue to support the costs of the expansion;
and 

our ability to finance de novo expansion and possible dilution to our existing stockholders if
our common stock is used as consideration. 

As a result of these and other risks, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to develop de novo treatment facilities or that a de novo treatment facility will become
profitable. De novo expansion could expose us to liabilities or loss. 

Our ability to maintain census is dependent
on a number of factors outside of our control, and if we are unable to maintain census (i.e., our daily patient occupancy), our business,
results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 

Our revenue is directly impacted by our ability
to maintain census (i.e., the daily patient occupancy of our facilities by bed count). Our ability to maintain census is dependent on
a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including our referral relationships, average length of stay of our patients,
the extent to which third-party payors require preadmission authorization or utilization review controls, competition in the industry,
and the decisions of our patients to seek and commit to treatment. 

A significant decrease in census could materially
adversely affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flows due to fewer or lower reimbursements received and the additional resources
required to collect accounts receivable and maintain our existing level of business. 

Given the patient-driven nature of the substance
abuse treatment sector, our business is dependent on patients seeking and committing to treatment. Although increased awareness and de-stigmatization
of substance abuse treatment in recent years has resulted in more people seeking treatment, the decision of each patient to seek treatment
is ultimately discretionary. In addition, even after the initial decision to seek treatment, our patients may decide at any time to discontinue
treatment and leave our facilities against the advice of our physicians and other treatment professionals. For this reason, among others,
average length of stay can vary among periods without correlating to the overall operating performance of our business. If patients or
potential patients decide not to seek treatment or discontinue treatment early, census could decrease and, as a result, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We operate in a highly competitive industry
where competition may lead to declines in patient volumes and an increase in labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The substance abuse treatment industry is highly
competitive, and competition among substance abuse treatment providers (including behavioral healthcare facilities) for patients has intensified
in recent years. In 2018, there were approximately 4,200 substance abuse treatment businesses in the United States. There are behavioral
healthcare facilities that provide substance abuse and other mental health treatment services comparable to at least some of the services
offered by our facilities in each of the geographical areas in which we intend to operate. Some of our competitors are owned by tax-supported
governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may have certain financial advantages not available to us, including endowments,
charitable contributions, tax-exempt financing, and exemptions from sales, property, and income taxes. In some markets, certain of our
competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped, and offer a broader range of services than we do. Some of our competitors
are local, independent operators or physician groups with strong established reputations within the surrounding communities, which may
adversely affect our ability to attract new patients in markets where we compete with such providers. If our competitors are better able
to attract patients, expand services, or obtain favorable participation agreements with third-party payors, we may experience a decline
in patient volume, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our operations depend on the efforts, abilities,
and experience of our management team, physicians, and medical support personnel, including our nurses, mental health technicians, therapists,
addiction counselors, pharmacists, and clinical technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified
management, mental health technicians, therapists, nurses, counselors, and other support personnel responsible for the daily operations
of our facilities. The nationwide shortage of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue facing
our industry in recent years. This shortage may require us to enhance our wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical
support personnel or require us to hire expensive temporary personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we
may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could experience a decline in patient volume, all
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Increased labor union activity is another factor
that could adversely affect our labor costs. We do not currently employ a unionized labor force. In the event of the independent organization
or unionization of our employees, we may become subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, and other labor-relations
matters. Although we are not aware of any union organizing activity at any of our other facilities, we are unable to predict whether any
such activity will take place in the future. 

We depend heavily on key executives and
other key management personnel, and the departure of one or more of our key executives or other key management personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The expertise and efforts of our key executives,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Conte, and Patrick Ogle our Chief Operating Officer other management personnel are critical
to the success of our business. We currently do not have employment agreements or non-compete covenants with any of our key executives.
The loss of the services of one or more of our key executives could significantly undermine our management expertise and our ability to
provide efficient, quality healthcare services at our facilities. Furthermore, if one or more of our key executives were to terminate
employment with us and engage in a competing business, we would be subject to increased competition, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Failure to adequately protect our trademarks
and any other proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We intend to develop portfolio that we consider
to be of significant importance to our business, and we may acquire additional trademarks or other proprietary rights in acquisitions
that we pursue as part of our growth strategy. If the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights
are not adequate to prevent imitation of our services by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our services as an
alleged violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights, it may be necessary for us to initiate or enter into litigation in the future
to enforce our trademark rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others. The cost of any such legal
proceedings could be expensive, and such legal proceedings could result in an adverse determination that could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 

If we fail to comply with the extensive
laws and government regulations impacting our industry, we could suffer penalties, be the subject of federal and state investigations,
or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which may reduce our revenue, increase our costs, and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Healthcare service providers are required to comply
with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels relating to, among other things: 

licensure, certification and accreditation of substance use treatment services; 

licensure, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certification and accreditation of
laboratory services; 

handling, administration and distribution of controlled substances; 

necessity and adequacy of care and quality of services; 

licensure, certification and qualifications of professional and support personnel; 

referrals of patients and permissible relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

claim submission and collections, including penalties for the submission of, or causing the submission
of, false, fraudulent or misleading claims and the failure to repay overpayments in a timely manner; 

extensive conditions of participation for Medicare and Medicaid programs 

consumer protection issues and billing and collection of patient-owed accounts issues; 

communications with patients and consumers, including laws intended to prevent misleading marketing practices; 

privacy and security of health-related information, patient personal information and medical records; 

physical plant planning, construction of new facilities and expansion of existing facilities; 

activities regarding competitors; 

U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) laws and regulations related to drugs and medical devices; 

operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are
accurate, reliable and timely; 

health and safety of employees; 

handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens and infectious and hazardous waste; 

corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, self-referral and kickback prohibitions, including recent
state and federal laws intended to eliminate bribes and kickbacks; and 

the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which became law on October 24, 2018. 

A CLIA certificate demonstrates that a testing
laboratory meets the federal regulations for clinical diagnostic testing, ensuring quality and safety in the laboratory and laboratory
results. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 are administered by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS). 

The United States has recently enacted the Eliminating
Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA) to create a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (1) soliciting or receiving any remuneration
in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) paying or offering any remuneration
to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory.
Certain states, including Florida, have enacted similar laws, or will likely enact similar laws in the future. 

As a provider of addiction treatment services,
we are subject to governmental investigations and potential claims and lawsuits by patients, employees, and others, which may increase
our costs, cause reputational issues, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and reputation. 

Given the addiction and mental health issues of
patients and the nature of the services provided, the substance abuse treatment industry is heavily regulated by governmental agencies
and involves significant risk of liability. We and others in our industry are exposed to the risk of governmental investigations, regulatory
actions, and whistleblower lawsuits or other claims against us and our physicians and other professionals arising out of our day to day
business operations, including, without limitation, patient treatment at our facilities and relationships with healthcare providers that
may refer patients to us. Addressing any investigation, lawsuit, or other claim may distract management and divert resources, even if
we ultimately prevail. Regardless of the outcome of any such investigation, lawsuit, or claim, the publicity and potential risks associated
with the investigation, lawsuit, or claim could harm our reputation or the reputation of our management and negatively impact the perception
of the Company by patients, investors, or others and could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. Fines, restrictions, penalties, and damages imposed as a result of an investigation or a successful lawsuit or claim that
is not covered by, or is in excess of, our insurance coverage may increase our costs and reduce our profitability. Our insurance premiums
may increase year over year, and insurance coverage may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future, especially given the significant
increase in insurance premiums generally experienced in the healthcare industry. 

We also are subject to an inherent risk of potential
medical malpractice lawsuits and other potential claims or legal actions in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, we may
be subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a patient, that we failed to follow internal or external procedures
that resulted in death or harm to a patient, or that our employees mistreated our patients, resulting in death or harm. Any deficiencies
in the quality of care provided by our employees could expose us to governmental investigations and lawsuits from our patients. Some of
these actions may involve large claims as well as significant defense costs. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or the effect
that findings in such lawsuits may have on us. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may decide to negotiate a settlement,
and amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. All professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject
to policy limitations. We believe that, based on our past experience, our insurance coverage is adequate considering the claims arising
from the operation of our facilities. While we continuously monitor our coverage, our ultimate liability for professional and general
liability claims could change materially from our current estimates. If such policy limitations should be partially or fully exhausted
in the future or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, they could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We intend to care for a large number of patients
with complex medical conditions, special needs, or who require a substantial level of care and supervision. There is an inherent risk
that our patients could be harmed while in treatment, whether through negligence, by accident, or otherwise. Further, patients might engage
in behavior that results in harm to themselves, our employees, or to one or more other individuals. Patient safety incidents may result
in regulatory enforcement actions, negative press about us, or the addiction treatment industry generally, as well as in lawsuits filed
by plaintiff s lawyers against us. These developments could diminish public perception of the quality of our services, which in
turn could lead to a loss of patient placements and referrals, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.

 Table of Contents 

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations
could result in the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, loss of licenses or certifications, or require us to change
our operations, or in the ultimate exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and
state healthcare programs, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Both federal and state government agencies, as well as commercial payors, have heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement
efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare organizations. 

We endeavor to comply with all applicable legal
and regulatory requirements; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to adhere to all of the complex government regulations
that apply to our business. We seek to structure all of our relationships with referral sources and patients to comply with applicable
anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws, fee-splitting laws, and state corporate practice of medicine prohibitions. We monitor
these laws and their implementing regulations and implement changes as necessary. However, the laws and regulations in these areas are
complex and often subject to varying interpretations. For example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the compensation paid under
our contracts with professional physician groups, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay
substantial fines, or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result. 

We may be required to spend substantial
amounts to comply with legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to privacy and security of patient health information. 

There currently are numerous legislative and regulatory
initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security concerns. For example, the regulations contained in
42 CFR Part 2 (the Part 2 Regulations serve to protect patient records created by federally assisted programs for the treatment
of substance use disorders (SUD) and are administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) branch
of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Specifically, the Part 2 Regulations restrict the disclosure, and regulate
the security, of our patient s identifiable information related to substance abuse. These requirements apply to any of our facilities
that receive federal assistance, which is interpreted broadly to include facilities licensed, certified or registered by a federal agency. 

In addition, the federal privacy and security
regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) require our facilities to comply with
extensive requirements on the use and disclosure of protected health information and to implement and maintain administrative, physical,
and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic protected health
information. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect to their health information and impose substantial
administrative obligations on our facilities, including the requirement to enter into written agreements with contractors, known as business
associates, to whom our programs disclose protected health information. We may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate
violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be our agent. Covered entities must notify individuals, HHS and, in some cases,
the media of breaches involving unsecured protected health information. HHS and state attorneys general are authorized to enforce these
regulations. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and data
breaches and other HIPAA violations may give rise to class action lawsuits by affected patients under state law. 

Our programs remain subject to any privacy-related
federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. These laws vary by state and may impose
additional requirements and penalties. For example, some states impose strict restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information
pertaining to mental health or substance abuse. Further, most states have enacted laws and regulations that require us to notify affected
individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may
use its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches or other privacy or security lapses. 

As public attention is drawn to issues related
to the privacy and security of medical and other personal information, federal and state authorities may increase enforcement efforts
and seek to impose harsher penalties, as well as revise and expand laws or enact new laws concerning these topics. Compliance with current
as well as any newly established provisions or interpretations of existing requirements will require us to expend significant resources.
Increased focus on privacy and security issues by enforcement authorities may increase the overall risk that our substance abuse treatment
facilities may be found lacking under federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations.

Our treatment facilities operate in an environment
of increasing state and federal enforcement activity and private litigation targeted at healthcare providers. 

Both federal and state government agencies have
heightened and coordinated their civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies
and various segments of the healthcare industry. These investigations relate to a wide variety of topics, including relationships with
physicians, billing practices and use of controlled substances. The Affordable Care Act included an additional 350 million of federal
funding over ten years to fight healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse. The HHS Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice
have established national enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. Some of
our facilities participate in Medicare or Medicaid and, therefore, could be subject to government investigation. 

Even if a facility does not currently bill Medicare
or Medicaid for substance use treatment services, there is a risk that specific investigative initiatives or new laws such as EKRA could
result in investigations or enforcement actions that include or affect our treatment services, laboratory service providers, or marketing
operations. In addition, increased government enforcement activities, even if not directed towards our treatment facilities or laboratories,
also increase the risk that our facilities, physicians, and other clinicians furnishing services in our facilities, or our executives
and directors, could be named as defendants in private litigation such as state or federal false claims act cases or consumer protection
cases, or could become the subject of complaints at the various state and federal agencies that have jurisdiction over our operations. 

Any governmental investigations, private litigation,
or other legal proceedings involving any of our facilities, laboratories, executives, or directors, even if we ultimately prevail, could
result in significant expense, adversely affect our reputation or profitability and materially adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operation. In addition, we may be required to make changes in our laboratory, substance use treatment services or marketing
or other operational practices as a result of an adverse determination in any governmental enforcement action, private litigation or other
legal proceeding, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Changes to federal, state, and local regulations,
as well as different or new interpretations of existing regulations, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. 

Because our treatment programs and operations
are regulated at federal, state, and local levels, we could be affected by regulatory changes in different regional markets. Increases
in the costs of regulatory compliance and the risks of noncompliance may increase our operating costs, and we may not be able to recover
these increased costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. 

Many of the current laws and regulations are relatively
new, including the EKRA and recent state laws intended to prohibit deceptive marketing practices in the addiction treatment industry.
Thus, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. Evolving interpretations
or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or
could require us to make changes in our treatment facilities, equipment, personnel, services or capital expenditure programs. A determination
that we have violated these laws or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws could adversely
affect our business, operating results, and overall reputation in the marketplace. 

In addition, federal, state, and local regulations
may be enacted that impose additional requirements on our facilities. Adoption of legislation or the creation of new regulations affecting
our facilities could increase our operating costs, restrain our growth or limit us from taking advantage of opportunities presented and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse changes in existing comprehensive
zoning plans or zoning regulations that impose additional restrictions on the use of, or requirements applicable to, our facilities may
affect our ability to operate our existing facilities or acquire new facilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations
and profitability. 

We are subject to uncertainties regarding
the direction and impact of healthcare reform efforts, particularly efforts to repeal or significantly modify the Affordable Care Act. 

The healthcare industry is subject to changing
political, regulatory, scientific and technological changes, which have resulted and may continue to result in initiatives intended to
reform the industry. The most prominent of recent efforts, the Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, provides for increased access
to coverage for healthcare and seeks to reduce healthcare-related expenses. Among other mandates, it requires all new small group and
individual market health plans to cover ten essential health benefit categories, which currently include substance abuse addiction and
mental health disorder services. However, efforts by the executive branch and some members of Congress to repeal or make fundamental changes
to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and/or its interpretation have cast significant uncertainty on the future of the law. For
example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 2019, which may affect rates
of insurance coverage. 

26 

 Table of Contents 

We are unable to predict the full impact of the
Affordable Care Act and related regulations or the impact of its repeal or modification on our operations in light of the uncertainty
regarding whether or how the law will be changed, what alternative reforms, if any, may be enacted or what other actions may be taken.
Any government efforts related to health reform may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital
resources and liquidity. Moreover, the general uncertainty of health reform efforts, particularly if Congress elects to repeal provisions
of the Affordable Care Act but delays the implementation of repeal or fails to enact replacement provisions at the time of repeal, may
negatively impact our payment sources or demand for our services. 

The expansion of health insurance coverage under
the Affordable Care Act has been beneficial to the substance abuse treatment industry. This is due, in part, to higher demand for treatment
services, which resulted from the requirement that small group and individual market plans comply with the requirements of the Mental
Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which previously applied only to group health plans and group insurers. The 21 st Century
Cures Act requires development of an action plan for enhanced enforcement of mental health parity requirements and additional
guidance for health plans regarding compliance with parity laws. Increased demand for treatment services may bring new competitors to
the market, some of which may be better capitalized and have greater market penetration than we do. In addition, we expect increased demand
for substance use treatment services to increase the demand for case managers, therapists, medical technicians and others with clinical
expertise in substance abuse treatment, which may make it more difficult to adequately staff our substance abuse treatment facilities
and could significantly increase our costs in delivering treatment, which may adversely affect both our operations and profitability. 

One of the many impacts of the Affordable Care
Act and subsequent legislation has been a dramatic increase in payment reform efforts by federal and state government payors as well as
commercial payors. These efforts take many forms, including the growth of accountable care organizations, pay-for-performance bonus arrangements,
partial capitation arrangements and the bundling of services into a single payment. One result of these efforts is that more risk of the
overall cost of care is being transferred to providers. As institutional providers and their affiliated physicians assume more risk for
the cost of care, we expect more services to be furnished within provider networks that are formed for these types of payment arrangements.
Our ability to compete and to retain our traditional sources of patients may be adversely affected by our exclusion from such networks
or our inability to be included in such networks. 

Change of ownership or change of control
requirements imposed by state and federal licensure and certification agencies as well as third-party payors may limit our ability to
timely realize opportunities, adversely affect our licenses and certifications, interrupt our cash flows, and adversely affect our profitability. 

State licensure laws and many federal healthcare
programs (where applicable) impose a number of obligations on healthcare providers undergoing a change of ownership or change of control
transaction. These requirements may require new license applications as well as notices given a fixed number of days prior to the closing
of affected transactions. These provisions require us to be proactive when considering both internal restructuring and acquisitions of
other treatment companies. Failure to provide such notices or to submit required paperwork can adversely affect licensure on a going forward
basis, can subject the parties to penalties and can adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities. 

Many third-party payor agreements, including government
payor programs, also have change of ownership or change of control provisions. Such provisions generally include a prior notice provision
as well as require the consent of the payor in order to continue the terms of the payor agreement. Abiding by the terms of such provisions
may reopen pricing negotiations with third-party payors where the provider currently has favorable reimbursement terms as compared to
the market. Failure to comply with the terms of such provisions can result in a breach of the underlying third-party payor agreement.
As substance abuse treatment coverage and payment reform initiatives continue to expand, these types of provisions could have a significant
impact on our ability to realize opportunities and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability. 

State efforts to regulate the construction
or expansion of healthcare facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our facilities. 

The construction of new healthcare facilities,
the expansion, transfer, or change of ownership of existing facilities and the addition of new beds, services, or equipment may be subject
to state laws that require a determination of public need and prior approval by state regulatory agencies under CON laws or other healthcare
planning initiatives. The National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 requires the withholding of federal funds from
states that fail to adopt certificate-of-need (CON) laws regulating healthcare facilities. 

CON laws require healthcare providers wishing
to open or expand a healthcare facility to first prove to a regulatory body that the community needs the planned services. Review of CONs
and similar proposals may be lengthy and may require public hearings. States in which we now or may in the future operate may require
CONs under certain circumstances not currently applicable to us or may impose standards and other health planning requirements upon us.
Violation of these state laws and our failure to obtain any necessary state approval could: 

result in our inability to acquire a targeted facility, complete a desired expansion or make a desired
replacement; or 

result in the revocation of a facility s license or imposition of civil or criminal penalties on
us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Table of Contents 

If we are unable to obtain required regulatory,
zoning, or other required approvals for renovations and expansions, our growth may be restrained, and our operating results may be adversely
affected. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from such requirements, but we cannot predict their future
impact on our operations 

We could face risks associated with, or
arising out of, environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. 

We are subject to various federal, state, and
local laws and regulations that: 

regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such
as the generation, handling and disposal of medical and pharmaceutical wastes; 

impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals
on and off-site and other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and 

regulate workplace safety. 

Compliance with these laws and regulations could
increase our costs of operation. Violation of these laws may subject us to significant fines, penalties, or disposal costs, which could
negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We could be responsible for the investigation and remediation
of environmental conditions at currently or formerly operated or leased sites, as well as for associated liabilities, including liabilities
for natural resource damages, third-party property damage, or personal injury resulting from lawsuits that could be brought by the government
or private litigants relating to our operations, the operations of our facilities, or the land on which our facilities are located. 

Liability for contamination under certain environmental
laws can be imposed on current or past owners or operators of a site without regard to fault. Therefore, we may be subject to these liabilities
regardless of whether we lease or own the facility or such environmental conditions were created by us, a prior owner or tenant, a third-party,
or a neighboring facility whose operations may have affected such facility or land. We cannot assure you that environmental conditions
relating to our prior, existing, or future sites or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired will
not have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Changes in tax laws or their interpretations,
or becoming subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes, could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. 

We are subject to tax liabilities, including federal and state taxes
such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease
the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount
of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our tax liabilities
are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. If we are required to pay
additional taxes, our costs would increase. 

COVID-19 RELATED RISKS 

The coronavirus may negatively impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including
the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern. On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared
a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020
the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic . The significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted
in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and could adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic,
pandemic, or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which
are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic
or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential
impacts of an epidemic, pandemic, or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Risk Related to Our Stock 

Because we can issue additional shares of
common stock, our stockholders may experience dilution in the future . 

We are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares
of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 194,982,479 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding and 100,000
shares of preferred stock are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares
of common stock and preferred stock, and to determine the rights, preferences, and privileges of shares of our preferred stock, without
consent of our stockholders. Consequently, the stockholders may experience more dilution in their ownership of our stock in the future. 

Trading on the OTC Pink Sheets stock market
may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell
their shares. 

Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets
stock market operated by the OTC Markets Group with the trading symbol UPDC . Trading in stock quoted on OTC Pink Sheets
is often characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business
prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover,
trading of securities on OTC Pink Sheets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a stock exchange like the NASDAQ
or the NYSE. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of our shares. 

Our shares of common stock may be very thinly
traded, or not at all, the price may not reflect our values and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our
shares of common stock either now or in the future . 

Shares of our common stock may be very thinly
traded in the future, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active
market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our
operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance
given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate
it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile.
 Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions
in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to affect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination
of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many
lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for any loans. 

Sales of our currently issued and outstanding
stock may become freely tradeable pursuant to Rule 144 and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price
of the shares of our common stock. 

Certain of our issued and outstanding shares of
common stock are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As restricted shares, these
shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions
from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence
that an affiliated person, such as our management, who have held our restricted securities for a period of
at least one year from the date of this Form 8-K filing, may, under certain conditions, sell every three months in brokerage transactions,
a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1 of a company s outstanding shares of common stock. There is
no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate after the restricted securities have been held by
the owner for a period of one year from the date of this Form 8-K filing. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from
the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of common stock, may have a depressive effect
upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop. 

The market for penny stocks has experienced
numerous frauds and abuses which could adversely impact investors in our stock. 

We believe that the market for penny stocks has
suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: 

Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter
or issuer; 

Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press
releases; 

Boiler room practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections
by inexperienced salespersons; 

Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 

Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated
to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.

We believe that many of these abuses have occurred
with respect to the promotion of low-priced stock companies that lacked experienced management, adequate financial resources, an adequate
business plan and/or marketable and successful business or product. 

A decline in the price of our common stock
could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations, and we may go out of
business. 

A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in
a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we plan to acquire a significant
portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price
of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to
invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds
from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop
new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business.
We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our equity securities
and we may be forced to go out of business. 

Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our
stock may be restricted by the SEC s penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our
stock. 

Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security
that has a market price (as defined in Rule 15g-9) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors . The term accredited investor 
refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC,
which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must
provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson
in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The
bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing
prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition,
the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must
make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the
secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability
of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability
of our common stock. 

FINRA sales practice requirements may also
limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In addition to the penny stock rules
promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending
an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.
Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts
to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least
some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which
may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock. 

We do not intend to pay any cash dividends
on our shares of common stock in the near future, and our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they
sell them. 

We intend to retain any future earnings to finance
the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future.
The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend
upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other
factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid,
there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive
a return on their shares unless they sell them.

We may incur significant costs to ensure
compliance with United States corporate governance and accounting requirements. 

We may incur significant costs associated with
our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements
under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable
rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming
and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain
director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher
costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals
to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect
to these newly applicable rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. 

We may not be able to meet the accelerated
filing and internal control reporting requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission resulting in a possible decline in
the price of our common stock and our inability to obtain future financing. 

As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring each public company to include a report of management on the company s
internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm
auditing a company s financial statements must also attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of
the company s internal controls over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the company s internal
controls. 

While we expect to expend significant resources
in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, there is a risk that
we may not be able to comply timely with all of the requirements imposed by this rule. In the event that we are unable to receive
a positive attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls, investors and others
may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and our stock price and ability to obtain equity or debt financing
as needed could suffer. 

In addition, in the event that our independent
registered public accounting firm is unable to rely on our internal controls in connection with its audit of our financial statements,
and in the further event that it is unable to devise alternative procedures in order to satisfy itself as to the material accuracy of
our financial statements and related disclosures, it is possible that we would be unable to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to secure additional
financing as needed. 

Our articles of incorporation provide for
indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the
interests of our shareholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors. 

Our articles of incorporation and applicable Nevada
law provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney s
fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities
on our behalf. We will also bear the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents, upon such person s
written promise to repay us if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification. This
indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us which we will be unable to recoup. 

We have been advised that, in the opinion of the
SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of 1933 (the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities
arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection
with the securities being registered, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent)
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur
is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors is likely to materially
reduce the market and price for our shares, if such a market ever develop. 

Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder
approval, to issue shares of blank check preferred stock with terms that may not be viewed as beneficial to common stockholders,
and which may adversely affect common stockholders. 

Our articles of incorporation allow us to issue
shares of preferred stock without any vote by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative
rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder
approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred
right to vote on decisions submitted for a vote of the stockholders, to a priority on distribution of our assets upon liquidation, the
right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of
the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock, and similar rights and priorities over our common stock.

We are a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Regulation S-K and as such, are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition
for the periods presented. The following selected financial information is derived from our historical consolidated financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with such consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere herein and the Forward-Looking
Statements explanation included herein. 

Background 

Since 2016, under current management,
we have sought revenue generating activities in various industries. Since then, we have made acquisitions in different industries, some
of which have been disposed. 

Over the last five years, we have
been unable to sustain any material income from our operations, have incurred recurring losses, have been unsuccessful at raising material
capital, either through debt or equity financing arrangements, and we have disposed of our beverage industry business line. These factors
provide substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Despite these challenges, the
Company has been able to continue as a going concern and has achieved certain operational successes that mitigate the historical trends
of the Company. These recent successes, specifically occurring during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, include the following: 

In February 2021, the Company consummated the acquisition of Vital Behavioral Health, Inc. and its wholly
owned subsidiaries via the issuance of equity which provides an opportunity to generate material operational revenues from in and out-patient
rehabilitation services. 

On April 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Agreement to raise Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars 2,500,000) from the sale of its Series A Preferred Stock at a price of One Dollar 1.00) per share for use in making
capital improvements to its facilities, in developing its business, and as general working capital. Purchase to occur at 100,000 per
month until approximately April 2024. 

Plan of Operations 

Subsequent to the entry into the
rehabilitation services industry, primarily through the acquisition of Vital Behavioral and subsidiaries, we initiated the following plan
of operations. 

Capital Raising Activities
(Current Commitments, Future Plans, Estimated Timelines) 

As mentioned above, on April 4, 2022, the Company entered into a Preferred Stock Agreement to raise Two
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars 2,500,000) from the sale of its Series A Preferred Stock at a price of One Dollar 1.00) per
share for use in making capital improvements to its facilities, in developing its business, and as general working capital. Purchase to
occur at 100,000 per month until approximately April 2024. To date, this agreement has not performed monthly as anticipated and is behind
on its commitment. At the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, two monthly installments had not been received. 

On August 26, 2021, the Company entered into a loan agreement whereby the Lender lent us 500,000. The
loan bears interest at 12 per annum, payable monthly, and matures with a principal balloon payment on August 19, 2022. As additional
consideration for the loan, the Company also issued the lender One Million Warrants exercisable into One Million Common Stock Shares at
an exercise price of 0.005 per share. This lender has expressed a willingness and preference for increasing this loan principal size
to 1,000,000.

Operational Accomplishments/Paths
to Revenue (Licensing Timelines, Additional Facilities, Future Acquisitions): 

On August 1, 2021, the Company s subsidiary VSL Frankfort LLC leased 10 apartments that are intended
to provide sober living accommodations for patients of the outpatient facility for the Company s subsidiary VBH Kentucky Inc. in
Frankfort, Kentucky. Each unit will accommodate multiple patients on a weekly pay basis. 

On August 26, 2021, the Company s subsidiary VBH Kentucky Inc. received approval of its first license
to operate an intensive outpatient facility for the treatment of substance use disorders in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Substantially
all costs to finish, and outfit the facility have been expended. 

All facilities are intended to accept Medicaid and Medicare, out-of-network insurance and private pay
patients. 

As of the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, Vital Behavioral
Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries had a census of approximately 50 patients and the Company had collected 38,190 beginning in April 2022
with census and trajectory to add approximately 10 additional patients per quarter and collections ramping up toward 100,000 per mont h .

Revenue and Cost of Revenue 

Beginning in April 2022 we started generating
revenues from behavioral health treatment services at our inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities located in Kentucky. Revenue for
the year ended June 30, 2022 was 38,190 compared to no revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021. 

Professional Fees 

We incurred professional fees of 199,036 and
 208,688 for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Our professional fees decreased by 9,652 for the year ended June
30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, the decrease of which is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounting and legal fees. 

34 

 Table of Contents 

As funding permits, we expect to incur higher
professional fees associated with on-going development of our brand, customers, and other relationship development. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, we
incurred general and administrative expenses of 1,136,209 and 268,051, respectively, representing an increase of 868,158 for the year
ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The 868,158 increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable
to our acquisition of VBH, Vital, and VSL consisting of the following expenses: rent expense and related facilities; payroll expenses;
insurance expense and consulting fees. 

We expect our expenses to increase over the next
several periods should we be successful in our new business plan, which will primarily consist of facilities costs, management and other
salaries, travel, and other corporate overhead. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was 170,804 and 28,459 for
the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 142,345. The
increase is primarily the result of the incurrence of new debt obligations totaling 564,000. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities 

As of June 30, 2022, the Company did
not have enough authorized and unissued shares of common stock to settle all its convertible debt obligations. As a result, the Company
recognized obligations to issue a total of 4,866,679 shares of common stock upon convertible debt conversion to derivative liabilities
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The value of the derivative liability moves in parallel with the movement of the market
value of the shares of the Company. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized a gain on the change in the fair value of
derivative liabilities of 167,236. The Company had derivative liability obligations of 70,727 as of June 30, 2022 compared to 237,963
as of June 30, 2021. 

Discontinued Operations 

On December 31, 2020, we completed the disposition
of our prior RSB Operations. The primary consideration in the disposal was the purchaser s assumption of liabilities totaling approximately
 251,000. As a result of the assets acquired not having any book value, we recognized a gain on disposal of approximately 251,164, net
of tax of approximately 11,000. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 As of June 30, 2022, we had a working capital
deficit of approximately 1,748,265. Over the next twelve months, we have estimated that in order to maintain reporting company status
as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will require cash for general and administrative expenses primarily consisting
of facilities costs, payroll expenses and professional fees, which include accounting, legal and other professional fees, as well as filing
fees. 

We believe we will be able to meet these costs
by raising additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our common or preferred stock and the procurement
of commercial debt financing, and through our operations which are expected to commence during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. However,
no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed or at all, or that such capital, if available,
will be on acceptable terms. Further, we have recently entered the rehabilitation services industry and may not be able to operate our
facilities at levels sufficient to meet our on-going obligations. 

For the year ended June 30, 2022, our operational
cash flows primarily consisted of incurring expenses in the normal course of business at levels commensurate with its funding levels and
resulting inabilities to commence commercially viable operations. Net cash used in operating activities was 800,750 during the year ended
June 30, 2022 and consisted of a net loss of 1,300,623 and net change in operating assets and liabilities of 511,757, offset by net
non-cash items of 11,884. The primary non-cash items for the year ended June 30, 2022, consisted of change in derivative liabilities
of 167,236 and offset by the depreciation and amortization of 44,503, non-cash warrant amortization of 55,000, amortization of debt
discount of 39,639 and stock issued for settlement of debt of 16,210. The significant change in operating assets and liabilities was
a gain in the fair value of derivative liabilities. We expect these operational cash uses to increase as we begin our operations
in the first half of fiscal 2023. 

Our investing activities consisted of acquiring
property and equipment totaling 75,819. We expect to make additional capital expenditures as our rehabilitation facilities increase operations. 

35 

 Table of Contents 

During the year ended June 30, 2022, we generated
 863,083 of net cash from financing activities through the issuance of convertible debt and notes payable of 564,000, proceeds from the
sale of non-controlling interest of 250,000, proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of 100,000 and from related party notes payable
of 3,000, which was offset by 53,917 of payments on notes payable and accrued interest. We expect to continue our financing efforts
throughout fiscal 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, and
2021, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements as set forth in Item 303(a)(4) of the Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The
preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These items are
monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in
the future. 

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for at fair
value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests
are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after
the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined,
and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition
date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for
business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation
of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based
on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize
customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates,
the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of goodwill or the recognition of additional consideration
which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is re-measured each period based on relevant information and changes
to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of fair value over
identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, instead goodwill is reviewed
for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 

Embedded Conversion Features and Other Equity-linked Instruments
(Derivative Liabilities) 

The Company classifies all of its embedded debt
conversion features, and other derivative financial instruments as equity if the contracts (1) require physical settlement or net-share
settlement or (2) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement).
The Company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that (1) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash
settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company), (2) give the counterparty a choice of
net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (3) contracts that contain reset provisions.
The Company assesses classification of its equity-linked instruments at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification
between equity and liabilities (assets) is required. As of June 30, 2022, the Company did not have enough authorized and unissued shares
to settle all outstanding equity-linked instruments resulting in the reclassification of certain instruments to liability. The Company
reclassifies outstanding instruments based on allocating the unissued shares to contracts with the earliest inception date resulting in
the contracts with the latest inception date being recognized as liabilities first. 

The Company accounts for contracts convertible
into common stock in excess of its authorized capital as derivative as liabilities. The derivative liabilities are re-measured at fair
value with the changes in the value reported as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using a Black Scholes option pricing model. The model is based on assumptions including
quoted market prices and estimated volatility factors based on historical quoted market prices for the Company s common stock and
are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as established by US GAAP. As of June 30, 2022, all derivative liability contracts
are convertible into a fixed number of shares of common stock.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders
and Board of Directors 

 UPD Holding Corp. and Subsidiaries 

Reno, Nevada 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UPD Holding Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 ,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit ,
and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated
 financial statements ). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at
 June 30, 2022 and 2021 ,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
 ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue, suffered recurring losses from
operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are
 also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating
the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which
they relate.

Income Tax Provision 

As discussed in Notes
2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s income tax expense includes U.S. and state income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis
and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is based
on the enacted tax rate for the year and the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. 

We identified management s calculation of
income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities (net of valuation allowance) as a critical audit matter because of the significant
judgments and estimates management makes to determine these amounts. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s
interpretation of tax law in its estimate of the associated provisions and tax charges required a high degree of auditor judgment and
increased effort. Our audit procedures consisted of 1) evaluating historical tax filings, and 2)
assessing the reasonableness of the valuation allowance. 

Accounting for Embedded Derivative Liabilities Related to Convertible
Notes Payable 

As described in Notes 
2 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company had embedded debt
conversion features, and other derivative financial instruments which required complex accounting
considerations and significant estimates. 

The Company determined that variable conversion
features issued in connection with certain convertible debt required derivative liability classification. These variable conversion features
were initially measured at fair value and subsequently have been remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company determined
the fair value of the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. 

We identified the accounting considerations and
related valuations, including the related fair value determinations of the embedded derivative liabilities of such as a critical audit
matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (1) the accounting consideration in determining the nature of the various
features (2) the evaluation of the potential derivatives and potential bifurcation in the instruments, and (3) considerations related
to the determination of the fair value of the various debt and equity instruments and the conversion features that include valuation models
and assumptions utilized by management. Auditing these elements is especially challenging and requires auditor judgement due to the nature
and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. 

Our audit procedures related to management s
conclusion on the evaluation and related valuation of embedded derivatives, included the following, among others: (1) evaluating the relevant
terms and conditions of the various financings, (2) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to
the accounting for the convertible debt, and the assessment and accounting for potential derivatives and (3) independently recomputing
the valuations determined by Management.

of our reporting units below their carrying values. We performed our annual test of goodwill for impairment as of June 30, 2022. The results
of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair values of reporting unit were in excess of the carrying value, and, thus, we did
not require an impairment charge.

Item 9A - Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that,
as of June 30, 2022 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the size and nature of the existing business operation.
Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate
accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until the organization can increase in size to warrant an increase in personnel, formal
internal control procedures will not be implemented until they can be effectively executed and monitored. As a result of the size of the
current organization, there will not be significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors nor formal audit committee. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over
financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that
receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be
prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness,
as of June 30, 2022, of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due
to the size and nature of the existing business operation for the following reasons: lack of segregation of duties; lack of multiple levels
of review; insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting; and lack of an independent director or
audit committee. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures
that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until the organization can increase in size to warrant an increase in
personnel, formal internal control procedures will not be implemented until they can be effectively executed and monitored. As a result
of the size of the current organization, there will not be significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors nor formal
audit committee.

12 month consulting agreements with CEO Mark Conte and COO Patrick Ogle, providing for
compensation of 5,000 per month to each officer for public company administration and behavioral health treatment facility operations

Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and
Nominating Committee 

 As of the date of this filing, we do not have
a formal Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating Committee. Our Board of Directors make all decisions that an audit
committee would ordinarily make. We have determined that we do, not have a member of its Board of Directors that qualifies as an
 audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

We believe that the members of our Board of Directors
are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we believe that at this time,
retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any revenues
to date.

Conflicts of Interest 

Certain potential conflicts of interest are inherent
in the relationships between our officers and directors, and us. 

From time to time, one or more of our affiliates
may form or hold an ownership interest in and/or manage other businesses both related and unrelated to the type of business that we own
and operate. These persons expect to continue to form, hold an ownership interest in and/or manage additional other businesses which
may compete with ours with respect to operations, including financing and marketing, management time and services and potential customers.
 These activities may give rise to conflicts between or among the interests of us and other businesses with which our affiliates
are associated. Our affiliates are in no way prohibited from undertaking such activities, and neither we nor our shareholders will
have any right to require participation in such other activities. 

Further, because we intend to transact business
with some of our officers, directors, and affiliates, as well as with firms in which some of our officers, directors or affiliates have
a material interest, potential conflicts may arise between the respective interests of us and these related persons or entities. We
believe that such transactions will be affected on terms at least as favorable to us as those available from unrelated third parties. 

With respect to transactions involving real or
apparent conflicts of interest, we have adopted policies and procedures which require that: (i) the fact of the relationship or interest
giving rise to the potential conflict be disclosed or known to the directors who authorize or approve the transaction prior to such authorization
or approval, (ii) the transaction be approved by a majority of our disinterested outside directors, and (iii) the transaction be fair
and reasonable to us at the time it is authorized or approved by our directors.

financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement
or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation
prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

6. been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated,
of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), any registered entity

Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

The General Corporation Law of Nevada provides
that directors, officers, employees or agents of Nevada corporations are entitled, under certain circumstances, to be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys fees) and other liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any suit
brought against them in their capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if they
had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. This statute provides that directors, officers, employees and agents may
also be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with a derivative
suit brought against them in their capacity as a director, if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification may be made without court approval if such
person was adjudged liable to the corporation. 

Our by-laws provide that we shall indemnify our
officers and directors in any action, suit or proceeding unless such officer or director shall be adjudged to be derelict in his or her
duties.

Director Independence 

Although we are not listed on a national securities
exchange, in determining whether the members of our Board are independent, the Company has elected to use the definition of independence 
set forth by the NASDAQ Stock Market NASDAQ and the standards for independence established by NASDAQ. After review of
relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his family members, and the Company, its senior management and
the Board, have determined that none of our officers or directors are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable listing
standards of NASDAQ. Mark W. Conte and Patrick Ogle are not independent directors under the NASDAQ standard based in part on their positions
as executive officers and employees of the Company. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 

The following table summarizes the aggregate fees billed to us by our
registered independent auditor in relation to the audits and quarterly reviews of the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022

The Board of Directors has reviewed the services
provided by WSRP for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the amounts billed for such services and after consideration, have
determined that the receipt of these fees is compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Board has discussed these
services and fees with its registered independent audit firm and Company management to determine that they are appropriate under the rules
and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as well as under guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 

The entire Board of Directors acts as our Audit
Committee. The Board of Directors does not have a financial expert serving on its committee at this time due to our size and nature. 

All audit and non-audit services are pre-approved
by the Board of Directors which considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditors 
independence. The Board of Directors pre-approves the annual engagement of the principal independent registered public accounting
firm, including the performance of the annual audit and quarterly reviews for the subsequent fiscal year, and pre-approves specific engagements
for tax services performed by such firm. The Board of Directors have also established pre-approval policies and procedures for certain
enumerated audit and audit related services performed pursuant to the annual engagement agreement, including such firm s attendance
at and participation at Board and committee meetings; services associated with SEC registration statements approved by the Board of Directors;
review of periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in connection with securities offerings, such
as comfort letters and consents; assistance in responding to any SEC comments letters; and consultations with such firm as to the accounting
or disclosure treatment of transactions or events and the actual or potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or interpretations
by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), or other regulatory or standard-setting
bodies. The Audit Committee is informed of each service performed pursuant to its pre-approval policies and procedures. The
Board of Directors have considered the role of WSRP in providing services to us for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and
has concluded that such services are compatible with such firm s independence.
