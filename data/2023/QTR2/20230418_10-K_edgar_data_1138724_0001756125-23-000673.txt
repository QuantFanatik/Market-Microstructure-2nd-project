 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Global Arena Holding Inc. the Company ), a Delaware corporation, is organized as a holding company. The Company became a public company on May 18, 2011, when it successfully completed a reverse merger with China Stationery and Office Supply, Inc., an OTC Bulletin Board company. The Company currently has three subsidiary companies. The Company, GAHI Acquisition, Tidewater Energy Group and GES do not trade crypto currency, nor do they participate in Initial Coin Offerings. 1) Global Election Services (GES) GES, formed on February 25, 2015, provides comprehensive technology-enabled paper Absentee/Mail Ballot and Online election services to organizations such as craft and trade organizations, labor unions, political parties, co-operatives and housing organizations, associations and professional societies, universities, and political organizations. GES has developed proprietary election software for a data storage and retrieval registration system to determine voter eligibility and prevent duplicate votes with In-Person digital signature capture, as well as proprietary election software for scanning/tabulation utilizing advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode imaging software featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. The hardware includes high speed optical scanners that are hard lined to a computer with all Wi-Fi disabled so the entire tabulation process occurs offline, eliminating the opportunity for hacking. This system provides three types of audit capabilities. GES is also working with multiple vendors and has made investments in companies that are developing Blockchain Technology for a data storage and retrieval registration system; tabulation of paper Absentee/Mail Ballots; and Internet voting. The Company has also signed a Letter of Intent to acquire the assets of Election Services Solutions including all clients, contracts and employment contracts. This asset purchase is currently pending. GES Acquisition of Election Services Solutions, LLC On March 25, 2021, the Company entered into a second amended purchase agreement (APA) with Election Services Solutions. Under the second APA the Company entered into an amended asset purchase agreement with Election Services Solutions, LLC. Under the amended APA, the Company will purchase 100 of the assets of Election Services Solutions, LLC and the Company will pay 650,000, of which 511,150 has already been paid, and issue 40,000,000 common shares to purchase these assets under this second amended APA. This APA replaces the first amended purchase agreement signed on May 10, 2019 wherein the Company was to purchase 100 of the assets of Election Services Solutions, LLC. The Company was to pay 550,000, of which 511,150 has already been paid, and issue 20,000,000 common shares to purchase these assets under this first amended APA. GES derives over 80 of its current business from Election Services Solutions. Management anticipates the closing of this transaction will occur in the second quarter of 2023. The ESS asset acquisition will give GES the ability to expand into the following areas: Alumni Associations The ESS team formally ran elections for Alumni organizations for over 25 years with memberships from 5,000 to 200,000. Labor Unions The ESS Management team has a more than 40-year history in administering elections to organized labor unions. Pension and Retirement Groups The ESS team formally ran elections for Pension and Retirement groups for over 25 years with memberships from 300,000. Credit Unions The ESS team formerly ran elections for Credit Unions for over 25 years with memberships from 100,000 to 500,000. Professional Trade Associations The ESS team formerly ran elections for Professional Trade Associations for over 25 years with memberships from 30,000 to 50,000. 4 
 GES Current Business As one of the United States premier providers of comprehensive election services, GES focuses on efficiency, accuracy, integrity and security. GES prides itself on being able to provide flawless results regardless of the size or complexity of the project. GES helps organizations manage elections, strengthen corporate governance, increase member participation, and reduce costs. Today s election officials take on tremendous responsibility in managing all aspects of the voting process from selecting products to ensuring fair elections and every phase in between. In an industry that is constantly evolving, these tasks become more challenging every day. GES provides full-service technology enabled election solutions to clients while offering the experience, support, security, and capacity needed to meet ever-changing client needs now and in the future. GES believes it is unique in its ability to integrate multiple methods of voting; customers can hold elections via Paper Ballots by mail or in person, Internet Voting, or any combination of these methods, which GES refers to as Hybrid elections. Every project begins with a full review of the bylaws to ensure total compliance. GES then prepares a formal project plan and timeline. An experienced Election Administrator manages every facet of the project, while keeping the client fully informed every step of the way. GES provides telephone and/or email support for any procedural questions and help for management as well as voters. GES projects enhance the image of professionalism of the client organization, providing our clients with peace of mind every step of the way. The GES senior management team has conducted approximately over 8,650 elections, involving more than 40,000,000 voters. Each organized labor election result requires an election certification submitted to the US Department of Labor, and for over 40 years, not one of our elections has been overturned. Election security is an absolute priority for GES. We have seen emotions run high in many projects. Our focus on the security and confidentiality of election information diffuses most concerns and creates a broad consensus that the project is being conducted correctly and impartially. Election Committees regularly observe our processing and tabulation activities. Paper Ballots; Absentee/Mail and In-Person Voting GES management has been handling paper mail ballot and in-person elections for Labor Unions, Associations, and other private organizations for over 40 years. This process starts with a nominations meeting, creation and printing of the ballot and all materials. For an Absentee/Mail election, ballot packages are mailed to all eligible voting members. On the voting/tabulation day, GES collects the mail and uses the proprietary registration system that we developed to authenticate and register voters by scanning a barcode on the Business Reply Mail envelope with the ballot inside. For an in-person election, voters are authenticated in our system, and they sign a digital signature pad for registration. The authentication is based on a database provided by the client and any ineligible or challenged votes are removed. Once this list of valid voters has been compiled, we open the envelopes with identifiers and pull out the secret ballot envelope/sleeve containing the ballot. Once the ballots are pulled from the secret ballot envelopes/sleeves, we scan them using our proprietary software and hardware system to tabulate the votes. We uphold the essential requirements that the vote is secret, and each voter only gets one vote. Organized Labor/Unions Organized Labor Unions and their memberships in the United States are represented at the Local level, the regional level, and the international level. The smallest membership totals are at the Local level, groups of locals in a geographical area combine to make up a regional level, and all members belong to an International Level. Elections occur in all these groups and subsets of them, which means that there could be multiple votes for the same union throughout the year, with GES charging a per-member fee for each one. Most Nominations and Officer Elections for union leaders occur every two to three years. Additionally, GES is regularly involved in other types of elections, including: Strike Votes, Contract Ratifications, Delegate Nominations, Dues Increases, Assessments, By-Law Changes and Unexpired Term Votes, all of which can be done online. Each union has by-laws that dictate the process and how often these elections occur. Due to our experience, it is a natural progression for GES to expand into administering Regional and International elections, which GES has already begun to do. 5 
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released official guidelines for voting online. Since then, we have worked to develop our systems to offer our customers the most advanced software available today. The DOL announcement has encouraged many unions to look into this option for non-officer elections because it is not only a more efficient process, but there is also a significant cost savings for the client. Residential Organizations, Co-op/Condos GES has been conducting elections for Homeowner and Co-Op Organizations for more than forty years. At GES, we understand the sensitivity of the project, and the need to present a flawless experience to the owners. GES is the independent and impartial third-party Organizations can trust to manage an election and provide an organization with the tools essential to strong leadership and good governance. GES provides complete management of an election project, from initial design of voting materials through tabulation. We support in-person, paper mail, and Internet voting using ballots or proxies. Signature verification, slates, and weighted, or share, voting are standard. No activity proceeds unless there is a quorum present. Interim results are available immediately and certified results normally follow within 24 hours. The GES Team has conducted elections at properties with fewer than 200 Membership Interests, and with more than 10,000. We have also conducted lotteries for public housing agencies including Section 8 Housing. Now more than ever it is important to know what property owners are thinking. For many clients, we've included a limited set of survey questions on the proxy for the Board election. This technique has proven effective in capturing voter interest and stimulating turnout, in addition to providing valuable feedback on the important issues. GES can develop a regular program of surveys to help the client more effectively gauge members' views on needed improvements, regulatory matters, or other association-related issues. This interaction is made even easier utilizing GES online voting platform. GES Developed Election Technology Voter Authentication and Registration Software GES has worked diligently to create a very specific proprietary registration election software that functions in authenticating and registering voting members in a data look-up system. In the event of an In-Person election, a voter ID can be scanned, or information typed in to pull that voter up. A digital signature is then captured and saved to complete the voter s registration and is available in a final list of Who Voted . In the event of a Mail Ballot, a barcode on the Business Reply Envelope is scanned and the status of that member is identified. If the member is not eligible to vote, that ballot is removed from the count. Additionally, if a member requests a replacement ballot and mails back that and the original, the system will flag the duplicate ballot, which is removed from the valid ballots ensuring only one ballot from each voter is counted. Because we must account for every single ballot, the system has multiple reporting options where we may deliver to the client the list of members who mailed in a ballot but were not able to vote, detailing the reason. Scanning and Tabulation Software The GES proprietary scanning election software is advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode scanning and tabulation software featuring de-skewing, de-speckling, and image correction. The computer hardware utilizes high-speed optical scanners and was designed to run hard wired without Internet or Wi-Fi access, ensuring complete security. The system allows for triple auditing capabilities, which are; electronically generated tabulation results, jpeg imaging and storage, and the original physical ballot. This advancement gives GES the ability to tabulate elections faster and more efficiently and brings the opportunity for GES to compete for larger elections. GES began successfully deploying this system in our elections during the third quarter of 2017. Online Voting GES has a current client base of hundreds of unions. GES is committed to providing a comprehensive, secure voting platform, using state of the art technology for election officials charged with running their elections. We also offer the option for a hybrid election, which allows members to choose a Mail Ballot, In Person and/or Online Voting options, while ensuring no one votes twice. GES strives to build a user experience that limits human error and makes the voting process as easy and seamless as possible while ensuring the highest level of secrecy, security, and One Voter = One Vote integrity that we have been committed to for nearly 4 decades. 6 
 In 2020, GES developed, built, and implemented a propriety online election voting solution that is compliant with Title IV of the United States Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards. GES built the platform on one of the most secure global infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is a comprehensive, evolving platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform as a service and packaged software (PaaS), and software as a service offering (SaaS). The platform enables GES to protect individual client data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention (if required). All data flowing across the global network interconnects with the GES secured data center and is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. Additional encryption layers exist as well. GES controls where our client data is stored, who can access it, and what resources your organization is utilizing at any given moment. Fine-grain identity and access controls combined with continuous monitoring for near real-time security information ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times, wherever your information is stored. GES encryption software uses AES 256 with a cryptographic key using an RSA elliptic curve of 4096, which is used to encrypt the communication of the client and the GES server, as well all client data hosted in the server. A six-digit security code, delivered to the voter s email address provided by the client, must be validated by the prospective voter in order to authenticate the identity of the voter before the voter may access the ballot. After validating the voter, the voter then votes anomalously, so that the identity of the voter and the ballot cast can never be matched. The GES voting platform verifies that the users does not use the back and forward browser button, a safe mechanism against tampering. Distributed denial of service DDoS protection tools help secure websites and applications and prevent DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with traffic traditionally delivered via botnets" that are created by networked endpoints connected via malware. The DDoS software protection provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latenc. The GES platform also provides voting features such as posting documents like candidate statements, pictures, contracts, or amendments to be voted on.

Growth Strategy for the Company Management believes there are four significant opportunities to increase market share; 1) The growth and expansion of GES current business and the expansion into paper absentee/mail for US Government and Foreign elections. 2) The additional development of interactive communication, between elected individuals and their constituents; 3) The development of Blockchain voting applications. 4) The div ersification of Tidewater Energy Group Inc. 1) Management believes there is an opportunity in conducting United States and Foreign Government Elections. GES senior Management teams primary business for over 40 years has been mail/absentee ballot elections. The market for GES conducting paper/mail ballot elections grew exponentially in January of 2017, when first President Barack Obama, and then President Donald Trump designated U.S. Elections Critical Infrastructure . In the U.S. there are 3,007 counties, 64 parishes, 19 organized boroughs, 11 census areas, 41 independent cities, and the District of Columbia, all of whom purchase updated Election Machines and Software. Each municipal county individually purchases election voting machines under the guidance of their own State s Secretary of State, recommendations from the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), and local election regulations . The United States Government, through the Elections Assistance Commission, certifies election software and hardware for use in U.S. Government Elections. The size and scope of the opportunity in US Government elections can be measured in recent legislation providing funding to US municipalities. On March 27, 2020, President Donald J. Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) into law. The Act includes 400 million in new Help America Vote Act (HAVA) emergency funds, made available to states to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus for the 2020 federal election cycle. This supplemental appropriation funding, distributed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), will provide states with additional resources to protect the 2020 elections from the effects of the novel coronavirus. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 into law. The Act includes 425 million in new HAVA funds made available. On March 23, 2018 , President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 into law, which included 380 million in Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants for states to make election security improvements. 9 
 Among the authorized uses of the grant funds is the replacement of voting equipment, specifically equipment that does not produce a paper record or that is determined to be at the end of its useful life. Recent published examples are: In 2019 , Hawaii (SB 166) allocated 789,598 for the purpose of a vote counting system contract. In 2019 , Georgia issued a 150 million bond package for the replacement of voting equipment statewide. The state also appropriated 12,840,000 from the General Fund for the purpose of financing projects and facilities for the Office of Secretary of State. In 2019 , Wyoming appropriated 7.5 million into an election readiness account (HB 21). The state's 3 million HAVA allocation will also be placed in this account, the majority of which will go toward replacing outdated voting equipment statewide. In 2019 , North Dakota enacted SB 2002, which included a one-time appropriation for voting equipment and electronic poll books statewide. The total amount of 11.2 million included 8.2 million in state funds and 3 million in HAVA funds. The opportunity for mail/absentee ballots became a page one story in 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Subsequent accusations of voter fraud, compounded by President Trump declaring the 2020 U.S. election voting as rigged and fraudulent, has led to almost 40 of the U.S. Electorate believing the 2020 election was fraudulent. On October 23, 2019, the Brennan Center has estimated that the national cost for some of the most critical election security measures to be approximately 2.2 Billion dollars over the next five years. The opportunity is even greater in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to social distancing requirements, voters should not be congregating at polling locations for In-Person voting. Mail and Absentee Ballot voting has emerged as a safe alternative to In-Person voting and which is a complicated process that requires a company like GES that has significant experience in conducting Mail Ballot voting to avoid problems. The Elections Assistance Commission (EAC) updated their Voluntary Voting System Guidelines to 2.0 in February 2021. This certification process can take approximately 6 to 9 months and companies applying for certification can spend up to 2,000,000 or more. With the current compliance directives also in place in many individual States, the Company and GES anticipate annual software maintenance of approximately 250,000. The Company and GES have previously engaged software and hardware developers and GES is currently preparing request for proposals to assist in the development of additional and hardware development to comply with the EAC 2.0 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines. This will require the hiring of additional technical software employees, and additional outside vendors who in initial discussions will require fees of approximately 2 million dollars and stock-based compensation In an effort further prove GES ability to administer municipal and government elections, GES in the 1st quarter of 2020 administered the private government election space when GES successfully completed the Statewide Presidential Primary for North Dakota Democratic-NPL. GES administered the statewide polling for all North Dakota residents who wished to vote in Democratic Presidential Primary by; managing a call center and processed over 3,000 mail ballot requests, set up equipment and trained Staff on our proprietary Registration Software for In-Person voting at 14 locations across the state, and processed over 14,000 ballots with our proprietary Scanning and Tabulation software system. GES IT staff customized our proprietary Voter Registration software to ensure voters cast only one ballot, whether by mail or in person and set up secure servers that processed voter sign-in and digital signature capture in real time from a database of over 600,000 potential voters. GES trained over 100 volunteers, many with limited or no technology experience on how to use the system. After a short tutorial, those volunteers handled the increased registration volume with ease. After the polls closed and all the votes were cast, GES tabulation systems processed the ballots using our proprietary Scanning and Tabulation software system. The 2020 North Dakota Democratic-NPL Presidential Primary caucus had the largest voter turnout in over a decade . Management believes there is an opportunity in conducting United States and Foreign Government Elections. GES senior Management teams primary business for 40 years has been mail/absentee ballot elections. The market for GES conducting paper/mail ballot elections grew exponentially in January of 2017, when first President Barack Obama, and then President Donald Trump designated U.S. Elections Critical Infrastructure . The effect of these Executive Orders was to refocus the Department of Homeland Security, and the Elections Assistance Commission to reenergize compliance on U.S. Government elections, and assist by making available resources such as intelligence, funding, training and best practices in election software and hardware, for all fifty States. 10 
 GES has begun undertaking the following six step benchmarks to qualify for the updated U.S. certification and is also considering individual State certifications. Step 1 - Voting System Testing, Testing current developed systems to U.S. Federal 2.0 Standards Step 2 - Technical Data Package Review; Reviews submitted documents against documentation requirements of outside agencies, published standards, or U.S. specifications Step 3 - Physical Configuration Audit; Examines the documentation of the system against the actual submitted system Step 4 - System Integration Testing; Executes tests on all components of a system configured as if the system was deployed Step 5 - Functional Configuration Audit; Examines submitted test data and conducts additional testing to verify submitted system hardware and software described in the documents submitted to the Elections Assistance Commission and the Department of Homeland Security Step 6 - Security Testing; Performs vulnerability assessments and penetration analysis to assess system vulnerabilities Most states have a vote by mail process right now. Voters may request an Absentee Mail Ballot from their County Board of Elections, or a Vote by Mail ballot is sent. In either case, our proprietary registration and tabulation software has an immediate need. In the 2020 election, 69 of voters nationwide cast their ballot nontraditionally by mail and/or before Election Day. This is the highest rate of nontraditional voting for a presidential election since questions regarding voting method have been included in the survey. By comparison, about 40 of voters cast their ballots by mail and/or prior to Election Day in 2016. Much of the surge in nontraditional voting was due to an increase in mail-in voting. In 2020, 43 of voters cast ballots by mail and another 26 voted in person before Election Day. In 2016, 21 mailed in their ballots and 19 voted in person prior to Election Day. (US Census Bureau 4/29/21) Most individuals think only of the Presidential election every four years as the Election. In reality, municipal Board of Elections throughout the U.S. are conducting elections annually for such elected positions as; Governor, Mayor, City Council, State Assembly, State Senate, Members of U.S. Congress (House every 2 years, Senate every 6) Civil and Criminal Justices, Sheriffs, School Boards, Village Trustees, etc. In short, most State and local municipal Board of Elections are in the market purchasing software and hardware every year. 2) Management also sees an opportunity in developing and creating Blockchain Voting Technology, and is working with Blockchain Valley Ventures and TrueVote Inc, which Management believes could positively impact Global in many aspects of its business, including; Securely storing and creating accurate Voter Registration Information on the blockchain. Creating an international capability to administer or joint venture in conducting foreign government elections. Creating a secure Internet voting record on the blockchain for online elections. Administer Financial Services Elections, such as Proxy s and shareholder votes. Documenting current voting applications. Reducing cost and time of delivery, enabling scalability. Blockchain Valley Ventures On June 27, 2019, Blockchain Valley Ventures and GES signed an amended agreement calling for a 25,000 CHF payment for the development and facilitation of an extended workshop with relevant and best in class third party blockchain technology companies, wherein BVV was to serve as an advisor in connection with a Voter Registration, Voter Authentication, and Voter Eligibility using a Blockchain Platform and GES would pay BVV 25,000 CHF payment upon completion of the engagement. This agreement replaced a June 19, 2019, engagement letter with Blockchain Valley Ventures BVV of Zug Switzerland. Under the terms of the original agreement, GES was to pay BVV 50,000 Swiss Francs (CHF). 11 
 GES made payments of 25,000 CHF and received the working paper primarily covering the following matters: Development and facilitation of an extended workshop with relevant and best in class third party blockchain technology companies such as Phoenix Systems AG, Securosys AG and others as well as any subject matter expert to be invited by Global Election Services Inc. Development of a high-level technology solution architecture and its requirements for the blockchain based voting registration platform with inputs from third party blockchain technology.

Development of an implementation recommendation with respect to Voting on the Blockchain Platform. Legal facilitation with respect to outside tax and legal advisors in connection with compliance with local and international regulation. Project Management during the engagement. The Working Paper discusses a high-level envisaged Blockchain platform, including a foundational flowchart, and implementation recommendation; BVV is a Crypto Valley, Switzerland based venture capital firm who consists of highly successful entrepreneurs, finance experts, blockchain technology experts and ICO experienced analysts and consultants. The documents created will be used by GES, to begin to create a Minimal Viable Product. This Product, along with GES licensing rights on GES existing Registration and Tabulation Software will be owned by GES. The Working Paper was completed in 2022. GES is developing with TrueVote, Inc. a comprensive end-to-end, decentralized, completely digital voting system. GAHC, GES parent owns 30 of True Vote.The TrueVote Voting System will be based on traditional, proven database methodologies and layered with a checksum that is posted on the blockchain, proving all data is immutable and unalterable.

Current GES Corporate Operations GES has developed and deployed proprietary Registration software, which was designed specifically to authenticate and register voters. This proprietary software functions as a data storage and retrieval registration system by cross-referencing eligibility status within a control voter database. In a mail ballot election, the voter s ID barcode, QR code, or signature on the Business Reply Envelope, can be scanned and the status of that voter is identified. If the voter is not eligible to vote or another ballot for that individual has already been registered in the system, that ballot is marked VOID and removed from the count. In an in-person election, the voter provides their name for look-up in the system. If they have not voted, a signature box pops up on the screen, the voter signs an electronic signature pad and the digital signature is captured next to their name. If a voter tries to vote more than once, an alert will pop up indicating that the voter has already registered, and the voter will not receive an additional ballot. Because we account for every single ballot, the system has multiple reporting options, which include the list of valid envelopes and list of voters whose ballot was void, detailing the reason. Once the voter is authenticated, the identifiers are removed to ensure a secret vote and the ballot is scanned for tabulation. 18 
 GES developed proprietary Scanning and Tabulation election software. This software features advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode scanning and tabulation system featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. The computer hardware was designed to run hard wired without Internet or Wi-Fi access, ensuring complete security. The system allows for triple-auditing capabilities, which are; electronically generated tabulation results, .jpeg imaging and storage, and the original physical ballot. This advancement gives GES the ability to tabulate elections faster and more efficiently. As experts in paper/mail ballot elections, GES began deploying this system in our elections in the third quarter of 2017 and it has been operating flawlessly. In 2020 GES developed, built and implemented a propriety online election voting solution that is compliant with Title IV of the United States Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards. GES built the platform on one of the most secure global infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is a comprehensive, evolving platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform as a service and packaged software (PaaS), and software as a service offerings (SaaS). The platform enables GES to protect individual client data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention (if required). All data flowing across the global network interconnects with the GES secured data center and is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. Additional encryption layers exist as well. GES controls where our client data is stored, who can access it, and what resources your organization is utilizing at any given moment. Fine-grain identity and access controls combined with continuous monitoring for near real-time security information ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times, wherever your information is stored. GES encryption software uses AES 256 with a cryptographic key using an RSA elliptic curve of 4096, which is used to encrypt the communication of the client and the GES server, as well all client data hosted in the server. A six-digit security code, delivered to the voter s email address provided by the client, must be validated by the prospective voter in order to authenticate the identity of the voter before the voter may access the ballot. After validating the voter, the voter then votes anonymously, so that the identity of the voter and the ballot cast can never be matched. The GES voting platform verifies that the users does not use the back and forward browser button, a safe mechanism against tampering. Distributed denial of service DDoS protection tools help secure websites and applications and prevent DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with traffic traditionally delivered via botnets" that are created by networked endpoints connected via malware. The DDoS software protection provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latencya unique Every state has Election Software Developers and Manufactures may also qualify by meeting individual requirements for individual States in the United States. GES has begun undertaking the following six step benchmarks to qualify for the updated U.S. certification and is also considering individual State certifications; Step 1 - Voting System Testing, Testing current developed systems to U.S. Federal 2.0 Standards Step 2 - Technical Data Package Review; Reviews submitted documents against documentation requirements of outside agencies, published standards, or U.S. specifications Step 3 - Physical Configuration Audit; Examines the documentation of the system against the actual submitted system Step 4 - System Integration Testing; Executes tests on all components of a system configured as if the system was deployed Step 5 - Functional Configuration Audit; Examines submitted test data and conducts additional testing to verify submitted system hardware and software described in the documents submitted to the Elections Assistance Commission and the Department of Homeland Security Step 6 - Security Testing; Performs vulnerability assessments and penetration analysis to assess system vulnerabilities 19 
 Trends and Uncertainties The Company currently has minimal revenues and operations and is investigating potential businesses and companies for acquisition to create and/or acquire a sustainable business. Our ability to acquire or create a sustainable business may be adversely affected by our current financial conditions, availability of capital and/ or loans, general economic conditions which can be cyclical in nature along with prolonged recessionary periods, and other economic and political situations. The Company has generated recurring losses and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. Management believes that it will be successful in obtaining additional financing, from which the proceeds will be primarily used to execute its new operating plans. The Company plans to use its available cash and new financing to develop and execute its new business plan and hopefully create and maintain a self-sustaining business. However, the Company can give no assurances that it will be successful in achieving its plans or if financing will be available or, if available, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, and ultimately achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all of its operating activities. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from our continuing operations except for the fair value change on derivative financial instruments and settlement on arbitration. The rapid advances in computing and telecommunications technology over the past several decades have brought with them increasingly sophisticated methods of delivering administrating elections. Along with these advances, though, have come risks regarding the integrity and privacy of data, and these risks apply to election companies, falling into the general classification of cybersecurity. While it is not possible for anyone to give an absolute guarantee that data will not be compromised, when applicable, the Company shall utilize third-party service providers to secure the Company s financial and personal data; the Company believes that third-party service providers provide reasonable assurance that the financial and personal data that they hold are secure. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 31,306,048 and a working capital deficit of 9,215,598.

We recorded an amortization of debt discount of 321,970, a change in fair value of derivative liability of 2,251 and had a decrease in accounts payable of 38,917 and a decrease in deferred revenue of 21,500.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 29,594,851 and a working capital deficit of 8,172,977.

Management believes that it will be able to continue its operations and further advance its acquisition plans. However, management cannot give assurances that such plans will materialize and be successful in the near term or on terms advantageous to the Company, or at all. Should the Company not be successful in its new business plans or obtain additional financing, the Company would need to curtail certain or all of its operating activities. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 have included a going concern modification in their auditors reports. A going concern modification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot presently be determined. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve our operating results. Results of Operations for the year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 697,060 compared to 1,223,116 for the year ended December 31, 2021 decrease of 526,056. The majority of our clients hold elections on a three-year cycle. This decrease in revenues is due primarily to less elections held during the year of 2022. Salaries and benefits totaled 809,048 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 591,595 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was due to the employment compensation increase by 10 every year for John Matthews and Kathryn Weisbeck. Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 319,162 compared to 412,798 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an decrease of 93,636. This decrease is primarily due to lower professional services during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred marketing and advertising expenses of 143,392 compared to the 200,554 in the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred software development expenses of 45,784 in 2022 compared to 70,672 in 2021, we incurred printing costs of 165,125 in 2022 compared to 370,434 in 2021, and we incurred general and administrative expenses of 239,976 in 2022 compared to 249,065 in 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in costs due to the decrease in revenue. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 1,722,487 compared to 1,895,118 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an decrease of 172,631 principally due to reasons discussed above. Critical Accounting Policies The Company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's applications of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for the Company include revenue recognition, valuation of convertible promissory notes and related warrants, stock and stock option compensation, estimates, and derivative financial instruments. 21 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of GAHI and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, GES and GAHI Acquisition Corp. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers. The Company earns revenues through various services it provides to its clients. GES s income is recognized at the presentation date of the certification of the election results. The payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Should an election not proceed, all non-refundable deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue. The Company s revenue recognition policies comply with SEC revenue recognition rules and the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606-10-S65-1. The Company earns revenues through various services it provides to its clients. GES s income is recognized at the presentation date of the certification of the election results. The payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Should an election not proceed, all non-refundable deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue. Convertible Debt Convertible debt is accounted for under FASB ASC 470, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company records a beneficial conversion feature BCF related to the issuance of convertible debt that has conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued and records the relative fair value of any warrants issued with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features, both of which are credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company calculates the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation method, using the same assumptions used for valuing stock options, except that the contractual life of the warrant is used. Under these guidelines, the Company allocates the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between the conversion feature and any other detachable instruments (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair value of the BCF and warrants are recorded as a debt discount and is accreted over the expected term of the convertible debt as interest expense. The Company accounts for modifications of its embedded conversion features in accordance with the ASC which requires the modification of a convertible debt instrument that changes the fair value of an embedded conversion feature and the subsequent recognition of interest expense or the associated debt instrument when the modification does not result in a debt extinguishment. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Share-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees. 22 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 , Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid -in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluation the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Global Arena Holding Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Arena Holding Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Going concern uncertainty 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses since inception, experiences a deficiency of cash flow from operations, sold its principal operating business, is currently in default of certain outstanding notes, and has a stockholders deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Under this agreement, BTC would have merged with GAHI Acquisition, and GAHI Acquisition, would have been the surviving corporation. As consideration for the merger, the Company was to reserve a number of shares equal to 1/3 the total issued and outstanding of the Company to be issued to BTC shareholders at closing.

 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operating. In addition, certain of the Company s debt is in default as of December 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive cash flows from operations. The Company continues to raise funds from the issuance of additional convertible promissory note. Management is hopeful that with their ability to raise additional funds that the Company should be able to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. These . In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, deductibility of the Company s net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in the event of a change of control. 
 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. 
 
 FASB ASC 740 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including a company s performance, the market environment in which the company operates, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and expectations of future profits, etc. The Company believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to the future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 . The change in the deferred tax valuation allowance increased by approximately and during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The increase in 2022 and 2021 was a result of additional net operating losses. 
 
 The components of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: 

Less: valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax asset 

The Company evaluated the provisions of FASB ASC 740 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements. FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits. A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carryforward or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of FASB ASC 740. Interest costs related to unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated (if applicable) and would be classified as interest expense, net in the statement of operations. Penalties would be recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 . As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the United States and in New York State and City. The Company is no longer subject to Federal, state and local income tax examinations by the tax authorities for tax years prior to 2017. 

The reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Company s effective rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows : 

State income taxes, net of federal benefit 

Non-deductible expenses

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Controls and Procedures During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officers have concluded such controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows. The relatively small number of employees who are responsible for accounting functions prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control system. Our internal financial staff lack expertise in identifying and addressing complex accounting issued under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Upon receiving adequate financing, the Company plans to increase its controls in these areas by hiring more employees in financial reporting and establishing an audit committee. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Given these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions. Important Considerations The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. ITEM 9 B. OTHER INFORMATION None 52

 Committees of the Board of Directors We do not have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. Our board of directors believes that it is not necessary to have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees at this time because the functions of such committees are adequately performed by our board of directors. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, an officer, director, or greater-than-10 shareholder of the Company must file a Form 4 reporting the acquisition or disposition of Company's equity securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than the end of the second business day after the day the transaction occurred unless certain exceptions apply. Transactions not reported on Form 4 must be reported on Form 5 within 45 days after the end of the Company's fiscal year. Such persons must also file initial reports of ownership on Form 3 upon becoming an officer, director, or greater-than-10 shareholder. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of these reports furnished to it, the officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements during 2022. Code of Ethics Policy During July 2008, we adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions. Corporate Governance There have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having no nominating committee for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs. Indemnification The Company shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by, and in the manner permissible under the laws of the State of Delaware, any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Company, or served any other enterprise as director, officer or employee at the request of the Company. The board of directors, in its discretion, shall have the power on behalf of the Company to indemnify any person, other than a director or officer, made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he/she is or was an employee of the Company. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceedings) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with any securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issues. INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS OR PERSONS CONTROLLING THE COMPANY FOR LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, IS HELD TO BE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IS THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. 54
