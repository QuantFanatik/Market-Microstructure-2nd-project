1. BUSINESS 

BUSINESS
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW 

Earth
Science Tech, Inc. ETST or the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April
23, 2010, and subsequently changed its domicile to the State of Florida on June 27, 2022. As of November 8, 2022, the Company is a holding
entity set to acquire companies with its current focus in the health and wellness industry. The Company is presently in compounding pharmaceuticals
and telemedicine through its wholly owned subsidiaries RxCompoundStore.com, LLC. RxCompound ), Peaks Curative, LLC. Peaks ),
and Earth Science Foundation, Inc. ESF ). 

RxCompound
is a complete compounding pharmacy. RxCompound is currently licensed to fulfill prescriptions in the states of Florida, New York, New
Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Nevada, Colorado, and Arizona. RxCompound is in the application process to obtain licenses
in the remaining states in which it is not yet licensed to fulfill prescriptions. 

Peaks
is a telemedicine referral site focused on men s health. Peaks orders are exclusively fulfilled by RxCompound. Patients
who order Peaks via monthly subscription receive their refills automatically. Currently, Peaks is focused on Men s health, and,
more specifically, ED. The company intends to expand offerings to include over the counter OTC (non-prescription) products
such as supplements and topicals. The OTC products will be custom manufactured or fulfilled through partnered companies under the Peaks
brand and offered worldwide. 

ESF
is a favored entity of the Company, effectively being a non-profit organization that was incorporated on February 11, 2019, and is structured
to accept grants and donations to help those in need of assistance in paying for prescriptions. 

Current
Operations 

CORPORATE
STRATEGY 

The
Company operates as a holding entity with a presence in the telehealth and compounding pharmaceutical sectors. Its primary objective
is to deliver contemporary and personalized health and wellness medications to patients. These offerings primarily target chronic conditions,
which often require recurring prescriptions and continuous healthcare support. 

Most
of the offerings on Peaks website are sold to customers on a subscription basis. Subscription plans provide an easy and convenient
way for customers to get the ongoing treatment they need while simultaneously providing the Company with predictability through a recurring
revenue stream. 

Acquisitions 

In
November 2022, we completed the acquisitions of RxCompound and Peaks. Peaks completed its PCAOB audit on December 30, 2022, and RxCompound
on February 3, 2023. 

PRODUCT
REGULATION 

As
a consumer-driven healthcare organization, we are required to comply with complex healthcare laws and regulations at both the state and
federal level. 

Marketing 

Peaks 
marketing strategy relies on a combination of social media and search advertising techniques to reach its target audience effectively. 

RxCompound
has garnered a remarkable reputation through positive word-of-mouth, owing to its innovative approaches and unwavering commitment to
quality. The team at RxCompound goes the extra mile by personally visiting new accounts to ensure a strong foundation and continuously
strengthens existing relationships through valuable partnerships. 

4 

COMPETITION 

The
Company s competitors are other Specialty Compounding Pharmacies in the markets in which the subsidiaries operate and any telehealth
platforms specializing in men s health. 

EMPLOYEES 

As
of March 31, 2023, the Company has eight (8) employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

A
description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our Class A common stock is set forth below.
You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including
our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class
A common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors,
including the risks described below. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Summary
of Principal Risk Factors 

Our
 limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our current
 business and future prospects and increase the risk of your investment. 

Our
 results of operations, as well as our key metrics, may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual
 basis, which may result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry and securities
 analysts or our investors. 

If
 we are unable to expand the scope of our offerings, including the number and type of products
 and services that we offer, the number and quality of healthcare providers serving our customers,
 and the number and types of conditions capable of being treated through our platform, our
 business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely
 affected. 

If
 we are unable to successfully market to new customers and retain existing customers, or if
 evolving privacy, healthcare, or other laws prevent or limit our marketing activities, our
 business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. 

We
 operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established healthcare
 providers and more traditional retailers and pharmaceutical providers with significant resources,
 and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively. 

Our
 brand is integral to our success. If we fail to effectively maintain, promote, and enhance
 our brand in a cost-effective manner, our business and competitive advantage may be harmed. 

Our
 pharmacy business subjects us to additional healthcare laws and regulations beyond those
 we face with our core telehealth business and increases the complexity and extent of our
 compliance and regulatory obligations. 

5 

If
 we fail to comply with applicable healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could
 face substantial penalties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
 could be adversely affected, and we may be required to restructure our operations. 

Evolving
 government regulations and enforcement activities may require increased costs or adversely
 affect our results of operations. 

Security
 breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related
 to our business or customers or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose
 us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. 

We
 may be subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property disputes,
 which are costly to defend and could materially harm our business and results of operations. 

We
 may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be
 available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Our
 Series B class Preferred stock structure has the effect of concentrating voting power with
 our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Giorgio R. Saumat, which limits an investor s
 ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. 

The
 market price of our common stock may be volatile. 

Risks
Related to Peaks and RxCompound Business 

Our
limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and increase
the risk of your investment. 

If
we are unable to expand the scope of our offerings, including the number and type of products and services that we offer, the number
and quality of healthcare providers serving our customers, and the number and types of conditions capable of being treated through our
platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

If
we are unable to successfully market to new customers and retain existing customers, or if evolving privacy, healthcare, or other laws
prevent or limit our marketing activities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. 

Use
of social media and celebrity influencers may materially and adversely affect our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties. 

Our
brand is integral to our success. If we fail to effectively maintain, promote, and enhance our brand in a cost-effective manner, our
business and competitive advantage may be harmed. 

The
failure of our offerings to achieve and maintain market acceptance could result in our achieving revenue below our expectations, which
could cause our business, financial condition, and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. 

The
market for Peaks business model and services is new, rapidly evolving, and increasingly competitive, as the healthcare industry
in the United States is undergoing significant structural change and consolidation, which makes it difficult to forecast demand for our
solutions. 

Competitive
platforms or other technological breakthroughs for the monitoring, treatment, or prevention of medical conditions may adversely affect
demand for our offerings. 

6 

We
operate in highly competitive markets and face competition from large, well-established healthcare providers and more traditional retailers
and pharmaceutical providers with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively. 

The
activities and quality of healthcare providers treating Peaks customers and providing prescriptions to RxCompound, including any
potentially unethical or illegal practices, could damage our brand, subject us to liability, and harm our business and financial results. 

Any
failure to offer high-quality support may adversely affect the Company s relationships with customers and healthcare providers,
and in turn the Company s financial condition, and results of operations. 

Acquisitions
and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact the Company,
financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, if the Company is not able to identify and successfully acquire suitable
businesses, the Company, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed. 

Economic
uncertainty or downturns, particularly as it impacts the healthcare industry, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

If
Peaks is unable to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, Peaks may be unable to attract and retain customers. 

Peaks 
business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks. 

We
depend on a number of other companies to perform functions critical to Peaks ability to operate its platform and RxCompound s
ability to offer services, generate revenue from customers, and to perform many of the related functions. 

Disruption
in the Company s supply chain could negatively impact our business. 

The
Pharmacy business subjects the Company to additional healthcare laws and regulations beyond those that Peaks faces with its core telehealth
business, and RxCompound s services increase the complexity and extent of compliance and regulatory obligations. 

The
Company s payments system depends on third-party service providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. 

The
Company s pricing decisions may adversely affect our ability to attract new customers, healthcare providers, and other partners. 

The
Company s success depends on the continuing and collaborative efforts of its management team, and its business may be severely
disrupted if the company loses their services. 

We
depend on the Company s talent to grow and operate its business, and if unable to hire, integrate, develop, motivate, and retain
personnel, the Company may not be able to grow effectively. 

The
Company s inventory is stored in RxCompound s facility located in Miami, FL, and any damage or disruption at the facility
may harm the business. 

7 

Risks
Related to Governmental Regulation 

If
the Company fails to comply with applicable healthcare and other governmental regulations, we could face substantial penalties, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may be required to restructure our operations. 

If
Peaks or RxCompound s practices are found to violate federal or state anti-kickback, physician self-referral, or false claims laws,
the Company may incur significant penalties and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. 

Evolving
government regulations and enforcement activities may require increased costs or adversely affect the Company s results of operations. 

Changes
in public policy that mandate or enhance healthcare coverage could have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, and/or
results of operations. 

The
products Peaks and RxCompound sell are subject to FDA regulations and other international, federal, state, and local requirements, and
if the Company fails to comply with international, federal, state, and local requirements, Peaks and RxCompound s ability to fulfill
customers orders through our platform could be impaired. 

Peaks
and RxCompound may be subject to fines, penalties, and injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of products for unapproved
uses. 

The
information that Peaks and RxCompound provide to healthcare providers, customers, and partners could be inaccurate or incomplete, which
could harm the business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Peaks
and RxCompound use, disclosure, and other processing of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject
to federal, state, and foreign privacy and security regulations, and failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure
the information held could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on customers,
providers, and revenue. 

Public
scrutiny of internet privacy and security issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could deter
or prevent Peaks from providing services to customers, thereby harming the business. 

Security
breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to the business or to customers or prevent
access to critical information and expose the Company to liability, which could adversely affect the business and its reputation. 

Failure
to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject the Company to penalties and other adverse
consequences. 

Risks
Related to Intellectual Property and Legal Proceedings 

Failure
to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm the business and results of operations. 

The
Company may in the future be subject to claims that we violated the intellectual property rights of others, which are extremely costly
to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to operate. 

The
Company may be subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and
could materially harm the business and results of operations. 

Changes
in accounting rules, assumptions, or judgments could materially and adversely affect the Company, including recent statements from the
SEC regarding SPAC-related companies. 

The
Company faces the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance. 

8 

The
business could be disrupted by catastrophic events and man-made problems, such as power disruptions, data security breaches, and terrorism. 

Risks
Related to the Company, Results of Operations, and Additional Capital Requirements 

The
Company has a history of net losses, anticipates increasing expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. 

The
Company s results of operations, as well as our key metrics, may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in
failing to meet the expectations of industry and securities analysts or its investors. 

Peaks
relies significantly on revenue from customers purchasing subscription-based prescription products and services and may not be successful
in expanding its offerings. 

The
requirements of being a public company have strained and may continue to strain the Company s resources, divert management s
attention, and may result in litigation. 

The
Company may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at
all. 

If
the Company s estimates or judgments relating to its significant accounting policies prove to be incorrect, the results of operations
could be adversely affected. 

Adverse
tax laws or regulations could be enacted, or existing laws could be applied to the Company or to customers, which could subject us to
additional tax liability and related interest and penalties, increase the costs of the Company s offerings, and adversely impact
our business. 

Certain
U.S. state tax authorities may assert the Company has a state nexus and seek to impose state and local income taxes which could harm
the results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Ownership of the Company Securities 

Trading
in our common stock on the Pink Exchange has been subject to wide fluctuations. 

Our
common stock is currently quoted only on the OTCPink Marketplace, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity. 

The
regulation of penny stocks by SEC and FINRA may discourage the tradability of our securities. 

Florida
law, our Articles of Incorporation, and our by-laws provides for the indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense, and
correspondingly limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our shareholders because corporate
resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors. 

We
do not intend to pay cash dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our Company and any gain on an investment in our Company
will need to come through an increase in our stock s price, which may never happen. 

Because
our securities are subject to penny stock rules, you may have difficulty reselling your shares. 

Our
common stock market prices may be volatile, which substantially increases the risk that investors may not be able to sell their Securities
at or above the price that was paid for the security. 

9 

Because
we may issue additional shares of our common stock, investment in our company could be subject to substantial dilution. 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability to buy and sell our stock.

We
had product sales of 48,537 and a gross profit of 22,060, representing a gross margin of 45.45 in the year end March 31, 2023, compared
with product sales of 14,123 and a loss of 8,516, representing a gross margin of (60.30) in year end March 31, 2022. The revenue
increase in the year ended on March 31, 2023 compared with the year ended on March 31, 2022, is primarily due to acquisition of RxCompound
and Peaks. 

The
Company s acquisition of RxCompound was consummated on November 8, 2022, along with Peaks; however, RxCompound completed its PCAOB
audit on February 3, 2023, after the fiscal quarter that ended December 31, 2022. Hence sales of RxCompound were being recognized from
Feb. 2023 onwards. We are adding results of Peaks for Nov. 2022.

the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of approximately 379,266 compared to a gain from
continuing operations of approximately 3,173,260 for the year ended March 31, 2022. This increase in net loss is due largely to losing
the net income that was booked in the year ended March 31, 2022, from the Cromogen Settlement, see Note 6. Legal Proceedings in the period
ended March 31, 2022, 10-K filed July 22, 2022.

Costs
and Expenses - Costs of sales include the costs of manufacturing, packaging, warehousing, and shipping our products. As we develop and
release additional products, we expect our costs of sales to increase. 

General
and administrative expenses increased from 116,064 for the year ended March 31, 2022, to 231,892 for the year ended March 31, 2023.
This increase was due to the fees related from the second receiver appointed on August 22, 2021, and unwinding on June 2, 2022, for 137,851.
The remaining expenses include office expenses of 14,433, employee compensation of 38,595 (this includes RxCompound, Peaks, and the
Company), and the remaining balance in other various expenses. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined by 17 CFR 229.10(f)(1). We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices
as having a material effect on our net sales and revenues and on income from our operations for the previous two years or from continuing
operations going forward. 

INTEREST
EXPENSE 

Interest
expense decreased to 47,433 in March 31, 2023 year end compared with 86,706 in March 31, 2022 year end. This decrease in interest expense
was due to settlement of prior year s debt obligation refer to Note 7. 

NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We
use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner
that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplements the information provided by our GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, interest and income tax expense, minus income
tax benefit), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA
because we believe it more clearly highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial
measures, since Adjusted EBITDA eliminates from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. 

We
use Adjusted EBITDA in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that
Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater
transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone.
In addition, we believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in making period-to-period comparison of results because

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS REPORT 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

 Earth
Science Tech, Inc. 

 Miami,
Florida 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Earth Science Tech, Inc. as of March 31, 2023, the related statement of operations, stockholders 
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).

In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31,
2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to
the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. We were not engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are
required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

An
audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As
of March 31, 2023, the Company had in cash to fund its operations. The Company does not believe its current cash balance will
be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its current liabilities of . The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. These principal factors raise substantial
doubt concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has financed the Company s operations principally
through government loans, notes payable and equity finance. 

The
Company as of November 8, 2022, became a holding entity set to acquire companies with its recent two acquisitions, RxCompound and Peaks
both operating in the health and wellness industry. The Company s cash position may not be sufficient to pay its obligations and
support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management
believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues may provide the
opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient
revenues by acquiring companies and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and
generate sufficient revenues. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in
the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

and , respectively. 

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated,
then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be
disclosed. 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on
the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters
will not materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.

. The Company
considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments,
and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. 

The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated
financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than . As of March 31, 2023, the Company has t recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. 

Interest
and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions will be charged to interest and operating expenses, respectively. The
Company has net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) for income tax purposes of approximately . This loss is allowed to be offset
against future income until the year 2039 when the NOL s will expire. The tax benefits relating to all timing differences have
been fully reserved for in the valuation allowance account due to the substantial losses incurred through March 31, 2022. The change
in the valuation allowance for the years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, was an increase of and , respectively. 

Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 Section 382 imposes limitations on the availability of a company s net operating losses
after certain ownership changes occur. The Section 382 limitation is based upon certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of ownership
changes and the value of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes. It was determined that an ownership change occurred in October
2013 and March 2014. The amount of the Company s net operating losses incurred prior to the ownership changes are limited based
on the value of the Company on the date of the ownership change. Management has not determined the amount of net operating losses generated
prior to the ownership change available to offset taxable income after the ownership change. 

years. 

In
August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements , which will improve
the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies,
and adds certain disclosure requirements, and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2019, (for emerging growth company beginning after December 15, 2020). The Company has adopted this standard
effective from January 1, 2021, and the adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

The
FASB recently issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging
 Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s
Own Equity, to reduce complexity in applying GAAP to certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The
guidance in ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing
guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features
and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock. The guidance in ASC 470-20 applies
to convertible instruments for which the embedded conversion features are not required to be bifurcated from the host contract and accounted
for as derivatives. In addition, the amendments revise the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding
financial instruments and embedded features that are both indexed to the issuer s own stock and classified in stockholders 
equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity classification. These amendments are expected to result in more freestanding
financial instruments qualifying for equity classification (and, therefore, not accounted for as derivatives), as well as fewer embedded
features requiring separate accounting from the host contract. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 further revise the guidance in ASC 260,
Earnings Per Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted
method. In addition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled
in cash or shares. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021,
with early adoption permitted (for emerging growth company beginning after December 15, 2023). The Company has assessed
the impact this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. No material adjustments were required. 

Update
ASU 2021-10- Government Assistance (Topic 832) 

In
November 2021, the FASB issued guidance which requires business entities to disclose information about certain government assistance
they receive. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities within their scope for financial statements issued for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application of the amendments is permitted. An entity should apply the amendments in
this Update either (1) prospectively to all transactions within the scope of the amendments that are reflected in financial statements
at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application or (2) retrospectively
to those transactions. We do not expect adoption of this standard to result in additional disclosures within our Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

and goodwill is amortized over the estimated life of years. These assets are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual
basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability
by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the
future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. 

As
of March 31, 2023, as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the board members. 

Based
on its assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2023. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, has been audited by BOLKO CPA, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part
II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had outstanding 282,611,083 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock is currently entitled to one vote
on all matters put to a vote of our stockholders. The following table sets forth the number of common shares, and percentage of outstanding
common shares, beneficially owned as of the date hereof by: 

each
 person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our outstanding common stock; 

each
 of our current directors; 

each
 our current executive officers and any other persons identified as a named executive in the Summary Compensation Table
 above; and 

all
 our current executive officers and directors as a group. 

Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes general voting power and/or investment power with respect
to securities. Shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within
60 days of the record date, and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of other securities currently convertible or convertible
within 60 days, are deemed outstanding for computing the beneficial ownership percentage of the person holding such securities but are
not deemed outstanding for computing the beneficial ownership percentage of any other person. Under the applicable SEC rules, each person s
beneficial ownership is calculated by dividing the total number of shares with respect to which they possess beneficial ownership by
the total number of outstanding shares. In any case where an individual has beneficial ownership over securities that are not outstanding
but are issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants or similar rights within the next 60 days, that same number of shares is added
to the denominator in the calculation described above. Because the calculation of each person s beneficial ownership set forth
in the Percentage Beneficially Owned column of the table may include shares that are not presently outstanding, the sum
total of the percentages set forth in such a column may exceed 100 . Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each of the following
persons is 8950 SW 74 th CT, Miami, FL 33156, USA, and, based upon information available or furnished to us, each such person
has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite his, her or its name.

Rule
13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. That rule provides that
a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who directly or indirectly has or shares voting power and/or investment power with
respect to such security. Rule 13d-3 also provides that a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of such security within sixty days, including through the exercise of any option, warrant or conversion of a security.
Any securities not outstanding which are subject to such options, warrants or conversion privileges are deemed to be outstanding for
the purpose of computing the percentage of outstanding securities of the class owned by such person. Those securities are not deemed
to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of the class owned by any other person.

There
were no grants of stock options since inception to March 31, 2023. We do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation
intended to serve as incentive for performance. 

The
Board of Directors of the Company has not adopted a stock option plan. The company has no plans to adopt one but may choose to do so
in the future. If such a plan is adopted, this may be administered by the board, or a committee appointed by the board (the Committee ).
The Committee would have the power to modify, extend or renew outstanding options and to authorize the grant of new options in substitution
therefore, provided that any such action may not impair any rights under any option previously granted. The Company may develop an incentive-based
stock option plan for its officers and directors and may reserve up to 10 of its outstanding shares of common stock for that purpose.
