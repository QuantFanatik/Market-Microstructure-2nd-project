Item 1. 
 Business 

(a) Business Development 

The Company was organized
under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 8, 2012, under Gankit Corporation. The Company was development
stage company as an e -commerce business focused on selling a diverse set of products
through its website Gankit.com. 

On
May 12, 2014, the control block of stock, 20,000,000 shares of restricted common stock were purchased resulting in a change of control.
The Company then ceased to operate its e-commerce website and abandoned that business model, and re-focused on the development, branding,
and distribution of non-flame smoking devices. The Company changed its name at this time to Nhale, Inc. 

Business operations for Nhale
Inc. was abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced in 2020. The
Company filed its last 10-Q in 2016, this financial report included liabilities and debts. As of the date of this filing, these liabilities
and debts have not been addressed. 

On
November 24. 2020, the Eighth District Court of Clark County, Nevada granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result
of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation of the Company s charter. The order appointed Small Cap Compliance,
LLC SCC , the Custodian custodian with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise
debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize new classes of stock. Rhonda Keaveney is the sole member and control person for Small
Cap Compliance, LLC. 

The court awarded custodianship
to SCC based on the absence of a functioning board of directors, revocation of the company s charter, and abandonment of the business.
At this time, Rhonda Keaveney was appointed sole officer and director. 

Upon appointment as the Custodian
of CDXQ and under its duties stipulated by the Nevada court, SCC took initiative to organize the business of the issuer. As Custodian,
the duties were to conduct daily business, hold shareholder meetings, appoint officers and directors, reinstate the company with the Nevada
Secretary of State. SCC also had authority to enter into contracts and find a suitable merger candidate. SCC was compensated for its role
as custodian in the amount of 500,000 shares of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock. SCC did not receive any additional compensation,
in the form of cash or stock, for custodian services. The custodianship was discharged on April 7 2021. 

On January 20, 2021, SCC
entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bridgeview Capital Partners, LLC, whereby Bridgeview Capital Partners, LLC purchased 500,000
shares of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock for 37,000. These shares represent the controlling block of stock. Ms. Keaveney resigned
her position of sole officer and director and appointed Michael Dobbs as as CEO, Treasurer, Secretary, and Director of the Company. 

Bridgeview
Capital Partners, LLC is controlled by Michael Dobbs and Sean Lanci. 

Bridgeview Capital Partners,
LLC entered into a Stock Purchas Agreement with Yang Chong Yi whereby Yang Chong Yi purchased 500,000 shares of Convertible Series A Preferred
Stock. Michael Dobbs resigned as sole officer and director and appointed Yang Chong Yi as its CEO, Treasurer, Secretary, and Director
of the Company.

of Incorporation and changed its name to China De Xiao Quan Care Group Co., LTD on Sept. 22, 2022, trading symbol CDXQ.

Since October of 2022, the Company s
operations consist of a research and development, branding and distribution of non-flame smoking devices, along with computer software
development, sales and service for the brand, and elder care services, development, and management. 

The Company
implemented a new business model in 2022, statements made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have limited
history of performance. 

The analysis will be undertaken by or under the
supervision of our management. In our continued efforts to implement our business plan, we intend to consider the following factors: 

Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 

Competitive position as compared to other businesses of similar size and experience within our contemplated segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 

Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items; 

Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 

The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in our contemplated marketplace; and 

Other relevant factors 

In applying the foregoing criteria, management
will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available
data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity
to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities
for identifying and completing our business plan. 

We are unable to predict when we will, if ever,
be profitable. We anticipate that business opportunities would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers
and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others
who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons
who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate. 

We expect that our due diligence will encompass,
among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well
as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either
by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash
payments for services or expenses related to any analysis. 

We may incur time and costs required to select
and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty.
Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business that is not ultimately completed may result
in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder s fees, consultant s fees and other
related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.

As of the time of this filing, the Company
is in the business of research and development, branding and distribution of non-flame smoking devices, along with computer software development,
sales and service for the brand, and elder care services, development, and management. 

Our
elderly care system incorporates integrated control of community elderly care; standardization of home elderly care services; traceable
tracking of financial income and expenditure; big data monitoring of health management; big data support of user portrait; convenient
and barrier-free operation mode. 

On

The
purchase price was 285,000 and Chunsheng Qin became the majority shareholder of CDXQ. 

On March 27, 2023, China
De Xiao Quan Care Group Co., Ltd. CDXQ entered into a Non-Binding Letter of Intent (the LOI in which the
Company would acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of China Care Holding Group Inc., a Cayman corporation China
Care ). Mr. Chunsheng Qin is the sole owner of China De Ziao Quan Care Group Co., Ltd. 

The LOI contemplates the
acquisition of China Care, by CDXQ. China Care, which owns and operates Jiangsu De Xiao Quan Technology Group, a pioneer in elderly caring
industry, combining new generation of cloud intelligence with human-focused management. The company has self-developed an intelligent
caring system based on big data analysis and artificial intelligence, strengthening better care and tracking management for the elderly.
The LOI was entered into following arm s length negotiations. 

The LOI proposes that CDXQ
would acquire 51 of the issued and outstanding stock of China Care in exchange for the newly issued CDXQ stock issuance to the shareholders
of 70 million shares of newly issued unregistered shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, with no expiration date on the
conversion. 

Completion of the transaction
is subject to, among other matters, the completion of due diligence, the negotiation of a definitive agreement providing for the transaction
and employment agreements, satisfaction of the conditions negotiated therein and approval of the transaction by CDXQ s board of
directors, and all applicable state and federal law. No assurance can be given that the parties will be able to negotiate and execute
a definitive agreement or that the transactions herein contemplated will close. CDXQ will file notice of such agreement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on form 8-K when and if any such agreement is reached. 

On March 31, 2023, Chongyi
Yang resigned his position of officer and director and appointed Chunsheng Qin as President, CEO, Treasurer, Secretary and Director. 

Our Industry 

In 2021,
18.9 of China's population was over the age of 60, around 267.36 million people. And there are 20.56 million of the population over the
age of 65, accounting for 14.2 per cent. This means that there were 2.37 working-aged persons for every one retired person. In 2050, the
ratio is expected to drastically drop to 1.82 working persons for every one retired person. Furthermore, currently, 180 million Chinese
seniors suffer from chronic diseases, and over 15 million are facing dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. The current care system is
unable to sustain these drastic demographic and economic shifts. 

To address
this issue, the government is looking to increase private capital and investments in the industry, hoping to provide seniors with better
quality and more accessible services and options. 

4 

Under China's
14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), the development of an efficient long-term care (LTC) system is a government priority. The plan specifies
major goals and tasks for the five years, including expanding the supply of elderly care services, improving the health support mechanism
for the elderly, and advancing the innovative and integrated development of service models. 

It lists
nine major indicators, such as the number of elderly care beds of the ratio of nursing care beds in elderly care institutions, to mobilize
society to actively respond to population ageing. China will step up institutional innovation and boost policy support and financial investment
to enable the elderly to share in China's development achievements. Moreover, it is stated that China would also plan to establish about
10 industrial parks dedicated to the silver economy and build a string of cities into models. 

Competition 

China De Xiao Quan Care Group Co., Ltd is in direct competition within
our industry with entities that possess significantly greater experience and resources. Moreover, the Company also competes with numerous
other companies similar to it for such opportunities. We believe that acquiring China Care Holding Group Inc., will greatly increase our
competitive edge in the elder care services industry. 

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental
Regulations on the Business 

We are subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, and are required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q

Description of Securities 

The following description
is a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
have been filed with the SEC as exhibits to our registration statement on Form 10. 

Common Stock 

We are authorized to issue
100,000,000 shares of Common Stock with 0.0001 par value per share. As of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there were 30,000,000
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 

7 

Each share of Common Stock
entitles the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of stockholders. Accordingly, the holders of our Common Stock
who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the total voting rights can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the
holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of such directors. The vote of the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent to such act
or action, except as otherwise provided by law. 

Holders of Common Stock are
entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have
not paid any dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of
our business. Any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other
things, our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. 

Holders of our Common Stock
have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation,
dissolution or windup, the holders of our Common Stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution
to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our Articles of Incorporation
or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control. 

Our stock transfer agent is Securities Transfer
Corporation., located at 2901 N. Dallas Parkway, Suite 380, Plano, TX 75093. 

Preferred Stock 

Our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes
the issuances of up to 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with the following designations, rights and preferences: 

One (1) share of the as Convertible Series A Preferred
Stock shall be converted into one thousand (1,000) shares of common stock of the Corporation and entitled to one thousand (1,000) votes
of common stock for every one (1) share of as Convertible Series A Preferred Stock owned. The holders of the Convertible Series A Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to receive dividends. 

From time to time its Board of Directors may amend
the Preferred class of stock. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock
with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting, or other rights, which could adversely affect the voting power or, other rights of the
holders of the Common Stock. In the event of issuance, the Preferred Stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method
of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. 

At this time there are 1,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock authorized as Convertible Series A Preferred Stock and 500,000 are issued and outstanding.

The financial statements accompanying this Report
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of our business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we have not yet generated any revenue, had
a net profit of 1,137,258 and have an accumulated stockholders deficit of 2,133,594 as of December 31, 2022. These factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability

if we are unable to continue as a going concern.

Item 9A. 
 
 Controls and Procedures. 

Management s Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
at the reasonable assurance level. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over our financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to management regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

Our management, consisting of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors,
and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design
of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions,
or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

11 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management's Assessment Regarding Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

At the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as
appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal control of financial
reporting as discussed below. 

Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries)
and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 

Management conducted an evaluation
of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report, based
on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established.
This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of
the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective, because management identified a material weakness in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 

While the Company does adhere
to internal controls and processes that were designed, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of
duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance
of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could
have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that this control
deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial
statements may not be prevented or detected. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives 

Management has evaluated,
and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal
control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time.
Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that
have been and continue to be in use at the Company. 

12 

Changes in internal
controls over financial reporting 

There were no changes in
the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred prior to the Company s most recent financial quarter
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Shareholders and Board of Directors 

 China De Xiao Quan Care Group Co., LTD 

 New York, NY 

Opinion on the Financial
Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of China De xiao Quan Care Group Co., LTD. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations,
stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial Doubt
About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 3 to the financial statements,
the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s evaluation of the events and conditions and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in
Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is
not modified with respect to this matter. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are matters arising
from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ 

 We have served as the Company's auditor since
2022.

shares of Convertible Preferred Series A Stock to Mr. Chongyi Yang. The deal has
been done before March 31st, 2021. 

On September, 2022, the Company changed the name as
China Dexiaoquan Care Group Co., Ltd. and the code from NHLE to CDXQ correspondingly. 

The Company is focused on from the development, branding
and distribution of non-flame smoking devices to the development, sales and service of computer software, network software; elder care
services, development, and management, and related commodity sales etc. The Company is not actively trading during the current reporting
period. 

to a flat rate, effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act also creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e.,
Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI )) earned by controlled foreign corporations CFCs must be included
in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder income. The Company has been in loss position for years and zero balances of tax
provisions, deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the reporting periods ended. The tax reforms have no significant impacts on the
Company. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there
are outstanding common shares and potentially dilutive shares from convertible preferred stock. Each share of the
Convertible Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted into shares of common stock of the Corporation and entitled to 1,000 votes
of common stock for each share of Convertible Series A Preferred Stock owned. The holders of the Convertible Series A Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to receive dividends. 

However, these shares have not been considered in
the weighted average share calculation as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive due to the net loss position for the years then ended. 

as at December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In addition to operational expenses, as the Company
executes its business plan, it is incurring expenses related to complying with its public reporting requirements. In order to finance
these expenditures, the Company has raised capital in the form of debt, which will have to be repaid, as discussed in detail below. The
Company has depended on loans from private investors and outside investors for most of its operating capital. The Company will need to
raise capital in the next twelve months in order to remain in business. 

Management anticipates that significant dilution will
occur as a result of any future sales of the Company s common stock and this will reduce the value of its outstanding shares. The
Company cannot project the future level of dilution that will be experienced by investors as a result of its future financings, but it
will significantly affect the value of its shares. 

The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

Re: Cancellation of Indebtedness
Due to Statute of Limitations 

Dr. Yang, Chong Yi: 

We are furnishing you this opinion
at the request of China De Xiao Quan Care Group., Ltd. (the Issuer or, the Company in connection with the
fair presentation of the financial condition of the Issuer: specifically, whether certain indebtedness in the total amount of 2,422,652
(the Debt should continue to be reflected as due and payable by the Issuer. 

We have assumed
and relied upon the following additional information in rendering our opinion: 

1. All securities filings made by the Issuer and filed with Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC and OTCMarkets were true and correct, as of the date of filing. 

2. Since the date of the last SEC filing, a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2022 and filed with the SEC on November 16, 2022, (the Most Recent Filing ), there has been no payment made on any of
the Debt, and no agreements with any of the holders of the Debt. 

3. Furthermore, a review of the Company s spread sheet discloses that the Debt
(a) as of December 31, 2022 is comprised of promissory notes payable in the aggregate amount of 600,000 of principal and 818,208 derived
from accrued interest on the promissory notes and (b) as of April 12, 2023, there was an additional note in the principal amount of 400,000
and 604,444 derived from accrued interest. The total amount owed and due in regard to the promissory notes in question as of April 12,
2023 is 2,422,652. The Company s auditors and the Company s management have also responded to our inquiries that as of April
12, 2023, there have been no payments made on any of the Debt, and no agreements with any of the holders of the Debt. 

4. The promissory notes were issued by the Company between April 5, 2013 and November
17, 2013. The promissory notes all had maturity dates of between December 31, 2015 and April 12, 2017. 

5. The demand notes and laws governing
their liabilities are governed, by the laws of the State of Nevada. 

In connection
with this opinion, we have reviewed applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations and have made such investigations and examined
such documents and material related to the Company as we have deemed necessary and appropriate under the circumstances. 

1 

Our review has
been limited to reports filed with the SEC in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with representations
made by the management of the Company, without having independently verified such factual matters. 

The documents that
we have reviewed included, but are not limited to, the Most Recent Filing and all other documents and disclosures posted on the SEC and
OTC Markets websites, as well as a review of the draft financials reviewed by the auditors of the Company, as of the date of this letter. 

In our examination,
we have assumed and have not verified, (i) the genuineness of all signatures, (ii) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, if any (iii) the conformity with the originals of all documents supplied to us as copies, and (iv) the accuracy and completeness
of all corporate records and documents and of all certificates and statements of fact given or made available to us by the Company. 

State of the Law 

The statute of limitations
for the collection of promissory notes in Nevada is found in Section 104.3118 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. This Section provides
that a debt payable at a specific time must be commenced within six years after the due date. An action to collect a note payable on demand
must be commenced within six years after the demand, or when there have been no payments of principal or interest for a continuous period
of six years. With the limited exception noted below for demand notes, there is a 6-year statute of limitations for the collection of
a corporate debt issued in the State of Nevada. As explained below, the determination of when the limitations period begins depends on
whether the debt is evidenced by a promissory note or by another written contract. The debts reflected in the Most Recent Filing do not
indicate the terms of the loan. Even if it is assumed that the loan constituted demand obligations, the demand obligation was entered
into more than six years prior to the date of this letter. 

In addition, under
 NRS 11.200, Computation of time, the time in NRS 11.190 shall be deemed to date from the last transaction or the last item
charged or last credit given; and whenever any payment on principal or interest has been or shall be made upon an existing contract, whether
it be a bill of exchange, promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness if such payment be made after the same shall have become due,
the limitation shall commence from the time the last payment was made. No payments of principal or interest have been paid by the Company
on these promissory notes for over six years. 

Facts and Legal Opinion 

The Company
has stated that the promissory notes set forth above and identified on the balance sheet that constitutes the Debt was entered into in
excess of six years ago. Since that time there have been no collection efforts by the holders of the notes, or any party. 

Under Section 104.3118
of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the statute of limitations for collection of these debts against the Company is six years after the date
of the instrument. The above-listed obligation was entered into more than six years prior to the date of this letter. As a result of this
fact, and the assumptions made in this letter, we are of the opinion that the holder of the above-referenced notes may not legally bring
and action for collection of the instruments against the Company. As a result, we conclude that fair presentation of the financial statements
of the Company would require removal of the debt associated with the Debt. 

As to matters of
fact, we have relied upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company, and/or other sources, and I represent that
all such sources were believed to be reliable. We have relied upon the Company s assurances concerning the lack of payment, settlement
discussions or collection activities on the Debt since the date of this letter. 

2 

We have made no
independent attempt to verify facts as provided to me and set forth herein and this opinion is limited to and conditioned upon, the facts
as stated herein. 

We are qualified
to practice law in the States of California and we express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdictions except for those of the State
of Nevada and the United States of America referred to herein. 

This opinion
letter and the opinions it contains shall be interpreted in accordance with the Legal Opinion Principles issued by the Committee on Legal
Opinions of the American Bar Association's Business Law Section as published in 53 Business Lawyer 831 (May 1998). 

Our opinions set
forth in this letter are based upon the facts in existence and laws in effect on the date hereof and we expressly disclaim any obligation
to update our opinions herein, regardless of whether changes in such facts or laws come to our attention after the delivery hereof. 

This opinion is

is rendered solely for your benefit and no other person or entity, other than your successors and assignees, shall be entitled to rely
