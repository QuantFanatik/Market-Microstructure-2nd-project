Operational
Overview. 

US
Thin Films 

US
Thin-Film Corporation, a 100 owned subsidiary of GSTX holds a Patent Portfolio (IP) relating to the novel leading-edge production of
conductive transparent thin films. The thin films are based on a conductive nanoparticle technology, an innovative conductive coating
that self-assembles into a random mesh-like network pattern when coated, providing excellent electrical conductivity, high transparency,
and flexibility. The Technology was founded and developed in Israel and has built up significant R D profile for over 15 years with
more than USD 90 Million invested. The technology has won several international touchscreen technology awards. 

Applications
of the proprietary thin film in existing electronics applications outperforms current materials. Key applications include: Electromagnetic
Interference (EMI) Shielding, Flexible Transparent Antennas (4G/5G communications), Transparent Heaters (windows, goggles, etc), Touch
Displays (monitors, phones, tablets), Photovoltaic, OLED Lighting, Flexible Displays, Sensors, and numerous other electronic applications 

The
US Thin-Film technology is superior to traditional/existing technology with multiple times the electrical conductivity of conventional
ITO based transparent conductive films with a simple manufacturing method protected by the company s patent portfolio. 

The
company is presently in discussions with several contract manufacturing groups to produce initial samples of its thin film technology,
branded Dragonfly film, for product qualification and pre-sales activity purposes.

Water
Harvesting 

Water
scarcity is at the center of the world s most significant challenges. The United Nations estimates approximately 30 of the world s
population will face severe water shortages by 2025. Many people do not realise that the atmosphere, the air we breathe, contains a significant
amount of water. Humidity is water in the air. Air can hold 1-2 ounces of water per cubic yard. At any one instant, the Earth s
atmosphere contains 37.5 trillion gallons of water vapor enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with 1.5 inches of
rain if condensed. 

In
parallel, massive population growth and urbanisation has led to an unprecedented demand for fresh water. Investment in infrastructure
has been woefully inadequate, resulting in severe and critical water stress globally. 

There
are an estimated 13 trillion litres (3.4 trillion gal) of water floating in the atmosphere at any one time. There is 6 times as much
fresh water in the air as in all rivers and lakes in the world. 

The
Company is continuing commercialization of a unique water harvesting technology utilizing modular, self-contained units that can be solar
or grid powered, and deployed in urban and rural environments. The water harvesters will extract moisture from the ambient air and collect
as 100 pure fresh water. Each domestic water harvester will be capable of generating 30-50 liters (8-13 gal) of pure fresh water per
day for personal use, with commercial models collecting up to 50,000 liters (13,000 gal) per day. The 100 pure H20 extracted from the
atmosphere is also suitable for industrial use in green hydrogen production and pharmaceutical, semiconductor processing plants. 

A
100 operational subsidiary has been established for the water harvesting products. It will trade as Adaquo, which is a Latin verb meaning
to supply water. The company has engaged the services of two industry veterans (20+ years experience) to assist with commercialization
of the technology. 

Whilst
still undertaking in house development of the company s proprietary solid-state technology, the company is also exploring opportunities
to license and distribute existing products that have been market proven on an exclusive geographical basis. 

Quartz
Material. 

The
company has significant technical expertise and experience in the high purity quartz sector. Initially, the company focused upon acquiring
resources and developing high purity silica (99.9 purity) into commercial grade high purity quartz sand (HPQS 99.997 purity). HPQS
is essential for the production of semiconductors and photovoltaic solar panels. 

Although
the enterprise was successful in identifying substantial resources and valuable customers in Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and South-East
Asia, the company was unable to secure funding to scale to meet demand for HPQS product, largely due to complications with the onset
of Covid-19 in March 2020. The COVID Pandemic saw significant disruption to the global solar and semiconductor manufacturing sector.
This had significant flow on effects to HPQS market. It is anticipated that by mid-2023 the sector will be substantially recovered to
pre-covid levels of production and associated demand for raw materials. At present manufacturing levels of solar cells are showing strong
growth and a swift recovery. 

The
company is presently re-engaging with past acquisition opportunities and customers in the HPQ sector. At present there is a significant
production shortfall for the material and prices/volumes are showing strong growth. The company is continuing to pursue the development
of an Australian based production facility. 

Graphene
Material. 

Graphene,
a new material, was discovered in 2004 by two UK based Russian university professors who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their
discovery. Graphene is a 2D material, (one atom thickness) made from graphite/carbon atoms, and whilst still largely unknown to the world
is rapidly becoming a new industrial revolution in its own right with more than 8,800 patent applications for graphene and graphene enabled
product applications having been filed recently. We have taken an early-stage leading-edge position in this evolving new technological
field of graphene enabling and enhancement, specifically to focus upon development of graphene enabled photovoltaic solar panels. 

5 

Graphene
is the world s thinnest and strongest material ever, with remarkable electrical, thermal, and optical properties being the most
conductive material ever scientifically measured. A sheet of graphene material is only one single atom in thickness and is referred to
as a 2D nano-material having almost no measurable depth, only length and width. Graphene is also highly transparent and can be easily
flexed and stretched 25 of its size without breaking. However, it is also 200 times stronger than steel and harder than a diamond. Graphene
material is completely impermeable, even a helium atom (the smallest) cannot pass through graphene. The advent of graphene and the introduction
of the extraordinary benefits from combining graphene with existing materials and products. 

Our
main focus remains dedicated to our original premise of producing low cost, high grade, high purity graphene for industrial sales to
existing materials groups. 

Government
Product Approvals. 

There
are no identified government approvals required for our products and no export restrictions for the products. 

Effect
of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business. 

Management
believes that there are no identified existing or probable government regulations that will adversely impact our business. 

Research
and Development Activities. 

The
primary research and development during the next fiscal year will involve further development and evaluation of new efficient material
processing techniques. The company plans to manufacture samples of its products for customer validation and presales activity purposes. 

Additional
research and development resources will be progressively committed to develop new graphene/silica (quartz) and thin film materials and
applications to expand and diversify the company product offerings into complimentary high tech and clean tech storage markets. 

Compliance
with Environmental Laws. 

Based
upon our long-term experience, management believes that the nature of our proposed processing operations does not involve any onerous
environmental compliance requirements. Compliance costs have been identified and quantified in the company plan of operations, business
plan including financial plan. 

Employees. 

Certain
members of our management team have been involved in this industry since 2005 and this has resulted in an experienced team of learned
employees, advisors and technical experts in various locations and capacities within both Australia, Central Europe, and in the United
States. It is planned to increase fulltime and part time employees/contractors from the present levels to a minimum of 30 within the
next 12 months, subject to the company securing additional funding. 

At
the present time we rely upon experienced consultants with whom management has long-term relationships. 

Executive
Management and Technical Team. 

Our
executive management and technical team have largely co-worked together since 2005, and especially the last 5 years in Melbourne, Australia,
China and the USA. All the specialized human resources are available to us.

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is not restricted
from paying any dividends but is not obligated to declare a dividend. No cash dividends have ever been declared and it is not anticipated
that cash dividends will ever be paid. 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock. The provisions in the Articles of Incorporation relating to the preferred stock allow our directors to issue preferred
stock with multiple votes per share and dividend rights which would have priority over any dividends paid with respect to the holders
of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock with these rights may make the removal of management difficult even if the removal
would be considered beneficial to shareholders, generally, and will have the effect of limiting shareholder participation in certain
transactions such as mergers or tender offers if these transactions are not favored by our management. 

As
of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 393 shareholders of record . 

We
have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends
on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth. Any future
determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results
of operations, capital requirements and other factors the board of directors considers relevant.

Overview 

In
July 2017, the Company acquired Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a New Zealand corporation with substantial mineral resource and technical
engineering assets. 

In
September 2021, the Company through its 100 owned subsidiary, US Thin Film Corporation, acquired Specialty Material Group, Cayman Island
corporation who holds a significant group of invention and processing patents in making Nanoparticle conductive thin film material for
various industrial and technology applications. 

We
continue to seek new financing in the form of equity, debt, or a combination thereof to meet further development and general operating
obligations. Achieving sufficient funds soon is of vital importance. The Company has managed to raise sufficient capital by sale of shares,
but as of September 30, 2022, the Company has not been successful in raising sufficient funds to maintain primary operations. However,
substantial efforts are underway to secure funding, and we believe that funding for the Company is imminent in the near future, although
no assurance can be made as to the amount of funds, if any, or the terms thereof. 

Current
Business and Operation 

The
company has had a significant change of Management and the Board of Directors. Following the passing of Roger May (CEO) on 24 August
2022, the company has appointed Dr. Andrew Liang as CEO and Roger s son, Jason May, as CTO. They are both based in Melbourne, Victoria.
Rod Young, Michael Selsman and Juliana Tan have resigned as directors of the Company. Charles Wantrup and Jason May have been appointed
as new Directors on 29 September 2022. 

The
company has a renewed focus and strategy to supply materials and technologies for the cleantech sector. This leverages the existing company
operations and includes thin films, graphene, quartz, and water harvesting. The company is exploring acquisitions and partnerships in
aligned areas of materials. 

The
Company is actively recruiting new members of the management team to assist with implementing its strategic plan. The company is re-engaging
various opportunities that it was pursuing pre pandemic. 

Currently,
GSTX is primarily focused upon completing development and initial sample production of commercially viable products. The goal for the
2023 FY is to begin generating revenue.

General
Discussion . 

Whereas
management has been successful in the past in raising capital, there are no assurances that these sources of financing will continue
to be available to us and/or that demand for our common stock will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be
available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business
opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing
efforts, any of which could have a negative impact on its business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require it to: 

seek
 joint venture partners; 

monetize
 its assets; 

seek
 arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require the company to relinquish significant rights to products,
 technologies or markets; or 

explore
 other strategic alternatives, including a merger or sale of our company. 

Cease
 current operations 

To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities
may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities
may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on
our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet its operational needs, we may seek to compensate
providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to our existing stockholders. 

Inflation. 

The
impact of inflation on our costs and the ability to pass on cost increases to its customers over time is dependent upon market conditions.
We are not aware of any inflationary pressures that have had any significant impact on its operations over the past quarter and we do
not anticipate that inflationary factors will have a significant impact on future operations. 

Impact
of the Inflation Reduction Act. 

The
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. Among other things, the IRA contained
certain clean energy incentives and initiatives. The Company operates in sectors that management believe will benefit from these initiatives. 

Going
Concern and Management s Liquidity Plans. 

As
reflected in the consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30 2022, a net loss and net cash
used in operating activities for the year then ended and has generated no revenues since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of the consolidated financial
statements. 

The
ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on management s plans, which include the raising of capital through
debt and/or equity markets. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company s
existence until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to raise any additional capital. 

The
Company may also require additional funding to finance the growth of our anticipated future operations as well as to achieve its strategic
objectives. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In that
event, the Company would be required to change its growth strategy and seek funding on that basis, if at all. 

12 

The
Company s plan regarding these matters is to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow the Company the ability to
cover its current cash flow requirements and meet its obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will
be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms. In the event that the Company is unable to
generate adequate revenues to cover expenses and cannot obtain additional financing in the near future, the Company may seek protection
under bankruptcy laws. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. 

We
do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting
treatment. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and New Accounting Pronouncements. 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure
About Critical Accounting Policies, suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical
accounting policies. In FRR 60, the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones
that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and require management to make
its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies are set forth below. The methods, estimates, and judgments the company
uses in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial
statements. 

A
summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows: 

Stock-Based
Compensation We account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value
attributable to stock options is calculated based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is amortized to expense over the service
period which is equivalent to the time required to vest the stock options. 

Income
Taxes Income taxes are provided based on the liability method for financial reporting purposes. Under this method deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 

Uncertain
tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax positions in income tax expense. 

We
are required to file federal income tax returns in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions. Our tax returns filed
since inception are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with the normal
statutes of limitations in the applicable jurisdiction. 

Earnings
Per Share Basic earnings per share have been calculated based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated based upon the weighted-average number of common and potential shares and is not presented
when anti-dilutive. 

Financial
Instruments and Fair Value Measurements - As defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (exit price). The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can
be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. The Company classifies fair value balances based on the observability
of those inputs. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurement). 

13 

The
Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company
performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued interest, and due to related parties.
The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate
prevailing rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments - The Company accounts for freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock, including
common stock warrants, to be designated as an equity instrument or generally as a liability. A contract so designated is carried at fair
value on a company s balance sheet, with any changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in a company s results of operations. 

The
Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect any material
changes in fair value, with any such changes classified as changes in derivatives valuation in the statement of operations. The calculation
of the fair value of derivatives utilizes highly subjective and theoretical assumptions that can materially affect fair values from period
to period. The recognition of these derivative amounts does not have any impact on cash flows. 

At
the date of the conversion of any convertible debt, the pro rata fair value of the related embedded derivative liability is transferred
to additional paid-in capital. 

The
Company determines our derivative liabilities to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and uses the Binomial pricing model to calculate
the fair value. There are no derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Binomial model requires six basic data inputs:
the exercise or strike price, time to expiration, the risk-free interest rate, the current stock price, the estimated volatility of the
stock price in the future, and the dividend rate. Changes to these inputs could produce a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
The fair value of each convertible note is estimated using the Binomial valuation model.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of Graphene Solar Technologies Limited 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Graphene Solar Technologies Limited (the Company) as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders deficit, and cash flows
for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations, net cash used in operations,
and a lack of revenues to-date, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans
regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which they relate. 

 Going
Concern 

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations, net cash used in
operations, and a lack of revenues to-date. 

Auditing
management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgement given the fact that the Company uses management estimates
on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated. 

To
evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information that was the initial cause along
with management s plans to mitigate going concern and management s disclosure on going concern.

The
Company is also exploring acquisition opportunities for Critical Resources Assets (Minerals with identified supply chain risk), zero
emission fossil fuel replacement, green hydrogen and ammonia production. 

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described
below. The Company has not yet commenced any revenue-generating operations, does not have positive cash flows from operations, and is
dependent on periodic infusions of equity capital to fund its operating requirements. 

The
Company s common stock is traded on the Over-the-Counter Market under the symbol GSTX. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenues from
operations to date and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has a stockholders deficit as of September
30, 2022. Furthermore, the Company has experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and has
financed its working capital requirements during this period primarily through the recurring sale of its equity securities. 

As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within
one year of the date that the consolidated financial statements are being issued. In addition, the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022,
has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s plan regarding these matters is to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to allow the Company the ability to
cover its current cash flow requirements and meet its obligations as they become due. There can be no assurances that financing will
be available or if available, that such financing will be available under favorable terms. In the event that the Company is unable to
generate adequate revenues to cover expenses and cannot obtain additional financing in the near future, the Company may seek protection
under bankruptcy laws. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary. 

The
spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world from the first half of 2020 has caused significant volatility in
U.S. and international markets. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions relate to COVlD-19,
as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that governments
or we may take in respect of this COVID-19 may result in a period of business disruption. Any financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated
at this time but may materially affect our future business and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results
will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning
the severity of the COVID-19 and the actions required to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund its activities
and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profits. The Company s consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Because
the Company is currently engaged in an early stage of development, it may take a considerable amount of time to develop any product or
intellectual property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business is unlikely to generate any
sustainable operating revenues in the next several years. In addition, to the extent that the Company is able to generate revenues through
product sales, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flows. 

At
September 30, 2022, the Company had cash of 
 available to fund its operations. The Company
needs to raise additional capital during the year ending September 30, 2023 to fund its ongoing business activities. 

The
amount and timing of future cash requirements during the year ended September 30, 2023 will depend on the extent of financing the Company
is able to arrange. As market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can
be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to
continue to conduct operations. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company
would be required to scale back or discontinue its technology and product development programs, or obtain funds, if available (although
there can be no certainty), through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its assets, or
to discontinue its operations entirely. 

Intangible
Assets 

We
capitalize external costs, such as filing fees and associated attorney fees, incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights.
We expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance in the period incurred. We amortize capitalized
patent costs for internally generated patents on a straight-line basis for 7 years, which represents the estimated useful lives
of the patents. The seven-year estimated useful life for internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors
as: the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed, the overall makeup of the portfolio over time, and the length of license
agreements for such patents. The estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights, however, have been and will continue to
be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents.
The average estimated useful life of acquired patents is 6.7 years. We assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net
patent costs when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our patent portfolio may not be recoverable. 

Assumed
Liabilities 

As
a result of the acquisition of Cima Specialty Materials Ltd (CSML) from CIMA Nanotech Holdings Limited, CNHL , (a Cayman
Island Registered company) the Company s wholly owned subsidiary US Thin Film Corporation (USTFC) under the terms of the of the
Share Sale and Purchase agreement the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock for future liability settlement for assumed liabilities.
The fair value of these future assumed liabilities of 
 was recorded as a stock receivable. 

Revenue
recognition Policies (ASC 606) 

The
Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ).
The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services ASC 606 requires companies to assess
their contracts to determine the timing and amount of revenue to recognize under the new revenue standard. The model has a five-step
approach: 

1. Identify
the contract with the customer. 

 2. Identify
the performance obligations in the contract. 

 3. Determine
the total transaction price. 

 4. Allocate
the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract. 

 5. Recognize
as revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.

On
December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was signed into law. The Tax Reform Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January
1, 2018, except for certain provisions, and resulted in significant changes to existing United States tax law, including various provisions
that are expected to impact the Company. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to
21 effective January 1, 2018. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the Tax Reform Act during the year ended September
30, 2020. Given that current deferred tax assets are offset by a full valuation allowance, these changes will have no impact on the balance
sheet.

In
September 2021, the Company through its 100 owned subsidiary, US Thin Film Corporation, acquired Cima Specialty Material Limited, a
Cayman Island corporation who holds a significant group of invention and processing patents in making Nanoparticle conductive thin film
material for various industrial and technology applications. The patent portfolio was purchased from Cima Nanotech Holding Limited, the
parent company of Specialty Material, and was paid with 31 million shares of GSTX common stock for the purchase. Subsequently the management
and the auditors evaluated this intangible asset by considering its useful life, future economic benefit, and amortization, decided a
value of US 6.5 million entered the book and reported in the 10K filing 2021. The delayed commercialization process for the past year
prompted the management to examine the short-term revenue generating prospect of this intangible assets and to consider and accept the
recommendation of our auditors for a total impairment of the patents.

to existing law including lowering the corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 . In addition to applying the new lower corporate tax rate in
2018 and thereafter to any taxable income we may have, the legislation affects the way we can use and carry forward net operating losses
previously accumulated and results in a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet. The Company
has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the year ended September 30, 2022. Given that current deferred tax assets
are offset by a full valuation allowance, these changes will have no impact on the balance sheet.

9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 

There
are no changes in nor disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. Effective for May 7, 2020, the firm of M K
CPAS PLLC was engaged to serve as the new principal accountant to audit our financial statements. The decision to retain this accountant
for the years ended Sept 30, 2022 and 2021 was approved by our board of directors. 

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and
Interim Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive [and Financial Officer], or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the
framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in 2013 COSO ). 

As
of period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.
The Company s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below: 

Functional
Controls and Segregation of Duties 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. 

There
is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small number
of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would
need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain
optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation
of duty is feasible. 

Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the
Company s internal controls. 

15 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and implemented
by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Roger
May, our former Principal Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September
30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework (2013). Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management
has been addressing any underlying causes for our weaknesses in internal control which may have occurred as a result of limited resources.
The Company has also engaged local accountants in Australia to assist Company management to prepare the Company s financial statements.
