 our company and our business refer, to United States Basketball League, Inc. Certain statements, other than
purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected

materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is
inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects include, but are not
limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and
generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 

Overview 

Until March 22, 2023, we were
an emerging diversified investment vehicle focused on acquiring equity in companies that we believed were or could be leaders in the markets
in which they were involved. . 

On November 23, 2022, we
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Shurepower, LLC d/b/a Shorepower Technologies Shorepower ), under which Shorepower was merged with and into SPEV (formerly
 USBL The closing occurred on March 22, 2023.

Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTC QB Market under the symbol SPEV (formerly USBL . 

Our
shares are subject to Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny stock 
rule. The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
These rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of
shareholders to sell their shares. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors
must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of the security. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals
with assets in excess of 1,000,000 (not including their personal residence) or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together
with their spouse, and certain institutional investors. The rules require the broker-dealer to receive the purchaser s written
consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and require the broker-dealer to deliver a risk disclosure document relating to the
penny stock prior to the first transaction. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to customers disclosing
recent price information for the penny stocks. 

Holders 

As
of May 25, 2023 there were approximately 736 holders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are other persons
who are beneficial owners of our common stock held in street name. The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Olde
Monmouth Stock Transfer, 200 Memorial Pkwy, Atlantic Highlands, NJ 07716. Their telephone number is (732) 872-2727. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid cash or stock dividends and have no present plan to pay any dividends, intending instead to reinvest our earnings, if any.
For the foreseeable future, we expect to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and the payment of
any cash dividends on our common stock is unlikely. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

As of February 17, 2023, to
fund the purchase of Shorepower, we sold 11,000,000 shares of our common stock through the purchase of units at a price of 0.06 per
unit, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one shares of our common stock, for total
proceeds of 660,000. 

Issuer Purchase of Securities 

We did not repurchase any of our
securities during our fiscal year ended February 28, 2023.

We will need to raise additional
financing through grants, loans, securities offerings or additional investments to fund our ongoing operations. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law that became law on November 15, 2021, Congress will inject 7.5 billion specifically for charging stations. Shorepower has been highly
successful in obtaining government contracts and grants to deploy electric transportation infrastructure projects, in the past. We have

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 United
States Basketball League, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of United States Basketball League, Inc. (the Company as of February 28,
2023 and February 28, 2022 and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficiency), and cash flows for the
year ended February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United States Basketball
League Inc. as of February 28, 2023 and February 28, 2022 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended February
28, 2023 and February 28, 2022 conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Explanatory
Paragraph 

As
discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements, the 2022 financial statements have been restated to correct two misstatements. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on my audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor are we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
accompanying financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company s present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.

shares of common stock through the purchase of units at a price of per unit, each
unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase common stock, for total proceeds of . The Warrants are
exercisable for shares of the Company s common stock at a price of per share and expire two years from the date of issuance.
 . Using the fair value calculation, the relative fair value for the warrants was calculated to determine the
warrants recorded equity amount of , which has been accounted for in additional paid in capital. 

In
accordance to ASC 815-40, an equity-linked financial instrument can be classified in equity only if it (1) is indexed to the reporting
entity s own stock and (2) meets all other conditions for equity classification. The warrants are classified as equity instruments
because a fixed amount of cash is exchanged for a fixed amount of equity. 

The
fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions,
the expected life of the warrants, and the expected stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based
awards represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment.
As a result, if factors change and management uses different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different
for future awards.

The
expected life of the warrants was estimated using the simplified method, as the Company has no historical information to
develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns for its warrant grants. The simplified method is based on the average
of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. The expected life of awards that vest immediately use the contractual
maturity since they are vested when issued. 

For
stock price volatility, the Company calculated its expected volatility based on the historical closing price of its common stock, par
value 0.01 per share. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the
warrant at the grant-date.

At
February 28, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately that may be offset against future taxable
income. NOLs from tax years up to 2017 can be carried forward twenty years. Under the CARES Act,
the Company carry forward NOLs indefinitely for NOLs generated in a tax year beginning after 2017, that remain after they are carried
back to tax years in the five-year carryback period. No tax benefit has been reported in the February 28, 2023, financial statements
since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 

Due
to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting
purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to
use in future years. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by
tax authorities for years before 2016.

Management s
Report Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based
on their evaluation as of February 28, 2023, our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, being
our principal executive and principal financial officer, respectively, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, the President
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of February 28, 2023. 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended February 28, 2023, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company in accordance
with and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control
 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of February 28,
2023. We believe that internal control over financial reporting is not effective.

Background
of Executive Officers and Directors 

Mr.
Kim has been involved with truck idle-reduction technologies for more than 20 years as an engineering consultant and design specialist.
In a project sponsored by NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research Development Authority), he performed an operational analysis
of competing off-board truck stop electrification (TSE) facilities which helped develop a comprehensive understanding of the technical
issues of TSE technologies. He then led the design of the simpler and more cost effective Shorepower TSE infrastructure system that includes
power and entertainment connections: electrical power, video, and wireless Internet. He also led the design team responsible for the
engineering and assembly of Shorepower s comprehensive unattended automated payment and control system. Mr. Kim presented preliminary
findings for the TSE demonstrations at the Transportation Research Board s 83rd Annual Meeting in Washington, DC in January 2004. 

Mr.
Kim has been responsible for all Shorepower corporate operations and will continue to work with local, state and regional stakeholders
to develop a strong market position for electric transportation infrastructure. He will continue to recommend product improvements and
establish R D objectives, lead product engineering, manage assimilation of data collected from electrified facilities, and oversee
site construction and deployment activities at future locations. Mr. Kim has also been intimately involved with an Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) effort to develop electrical codes and standards for electric transportation power infrastructure. In February 2007 https://www.ecmag.com/magazine/articles/article-detail/codes-standards-big-rigs-getting-good-nights-rest the group submitted
recommended standards to the National Electric Code (NEC), which is now in the National Electrical Code Handbook, used by the majority
of jurisdictions throughout North America. 

In
2005 Mr. Kim completed the development and demonstration of a higher power Shorepower variant to provide electrical power to electric
standby transport refrigeration units (eTRU) on trailers, to keep refrigerated loads, such as meats, ice cream and pharmaceuticals, cool
while stopped (or during loading/unloading). This technology leveraged the existing Shorepower system design, but with significantly
increased power ratings that can employ a simplified automated control system. This system was the first of its kind deployed to two
warehouses in New York but is now commonly used as a more efficient and clean alternative to running diesel TRUs. 

Mr.
Kim performed an operational analysis of TSE facilities as part of the work sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and has a comprehensive
understanding of the technical attributes of these technologies. This 20 million project commissioned over 50 facilities with over 1,800
individual electrified parking spaces in 31 states. Jeff was also instrumental in the engineering and construction management of these
facilities, which includes design, cost considerations, safety, vehicle access/egress and maintenance of these facilities. This project
was conducted from 2010 through 2015 with the majority of the construction activity completed in 2012 through 2013. 

Mr.
Kim was appointed by Oregon s governor to the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Working Group which helped develop the State s
electrification plan. in September 2008 (https://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/09/oregon-governor.html). This plan provided guidance
to jurisdictions within the state to help adopt electric vehicle (EV) friendly zoning and planning codes and standards. 

Mr.
Kim also consulted for TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) in 2008, to help develop a transportation electrification plan in Japan and
how to capitalize on providing electricity to power the transportation sector. 

Mr.
Kim led the engineering team that designed, manufactured and installed some of the first (SAE J1772) Level 2 charging stations in the
world in 2009, to prepare for the arrival of the first current generation of electric vehicles in 2010+. In partnership with PGE, an
electric utility company in Oregon, this program deployed over 300 charging points in and around Oregon to help prepare for the introduction
of the first electric vehicles to hit the market that included the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt.

Mr.
Kim received a Bachelors Degree in Renewable Energy Resources from the University of California-Berkeley in 1995 and a Masters in Mechanical
Engineering from the University of Maryland at College Park in 2003. 

Saeb
Jannoun, CEO. Saeb is a serial entrepreneur, and investor since 1994. Mr. Jannoun has a Bachelor s in business administration and
a CFP degree. He has been the CEO and a Board Member of several public companies and is currently the CEO of United States Basketball
League Inc. Mr. Jannoun is the founder of Tess Holdings LLC, Living 360 LLC and Thirty 05 LLC., which concentrate on investments ranging
from health care to real estate. One of the main goals attributed to Mr. Jannoun s leadership is finding the best partners for
companies he is involved in and building shareholder value. 

Michael
D. Pruitt joined our Board of Directors in April 2021. He founded Avenel Financial Group, a boutique financial services firm concentrating
on emerging technology company investments in 1999. In 2001, he formed Avenel Ventures, a technology investment and private venture capital
firm. In February 2005, Mr. Pruitt formed Chanticleer Holdings, Inc., then a public holding company (now known as Sonnet BioTherapeutics
Holdings, Inc.), and he served as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer until April 1, 2020, at which time the
restaurant operations of Chanticleer Holdings were spun out into a new public entity, Amergent Hospitality Group, Inc., where Mr. Pruitt
has served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to date. Mr. Pruitt also served as a director on the board of Hooters of America,
LLC from 2011 to 2019. Mr. Pruitt received a B.A. degree from Costal Carolina University. He currently sits on the Board of Visitors
of the E. Craig Wall Sr. College of Business Administration, the Coastal Education Foundation Board, and the Athletic Committee of the
Board of Trustees. Mr. Pruitt s over 15 years of day-to-day operational leadership and service as a board member at public companies
Chanticleer Holdings, IMAC Holdings and Amergent Hospitality Group make him well qualified as a member of the Board. He also brings transactional
expertise in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets. 

The
Company does not have a separate audit committee. The Board of Directors functions as the audit committee. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company s executive officers, directors and persons who own more than
ten percent of a registered class of its equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Forms
3, 4 and 5 they file with the SEC. Based solely upon our review of the copies of the forms the Company has received, we believe that
all such persons complied on a timely basis with all filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during fiscal
2023. 

Code
of Ethics 

Following the merger with Shorepower,
we have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to its principal executive officer, and principal financial officer which is available on
our website. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Code of Conduct and must approve any waivers of the Code of Conduct for employees,
executive officers and directors. Any amendments to the Code of Conduct, or any waivers of its requirements, will be disclosed on our
website.
