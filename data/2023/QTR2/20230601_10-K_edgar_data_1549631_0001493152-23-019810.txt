CAUTIONARY
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

For
a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could affect our future events, developments or results, you should carefully
review the Risk Factors set forth under Item 1. Description of Business below. Considering these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the future events, developments or results described by our forward-looking statements herein could turn to be materially
different from those we discuss or imply. 

PART
I 

Item
1. Description of Business. 

Organization 

We
were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on November 29, 2011, under the name Quatra-Rad, Inc. and our incorporator
adopted our bylaws and appointed our two directors. On February 29, 2012, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name
to Quarta-Rad, Inc. On July 16, 2012, we amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common
stock to 50,000,000, 0.0001 par value from 1,500, no par value and effected a 10,000 to 1 forward split. On February 4, 2015, we filed
a Certificate of Correction to our Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation to correct it for inadvertently excluding
the 10,000 to 1 forward stock split, which our shareholders and directors approved on June 29, 2012. From November 29, 2011 (inception)
through May 2012, we had limited operations. Commencing in May 2012, we began sales and implemented our business plan to distribute detection
devices, including but not limited to Geiger counters, to homeowners and interested customers in North America by selling them on consignment
on behalf of a related party owned by our majority shareholder and which are purchased from a company owned by our minority shareholder.
We also purchase the products directly from the company owned by our minority shareholder and sell them to independent third party resellers.
A Geiger counter is an instrument used for measuring ionizing radiation. It detects radiation such as Beta particles, Gamma rays and
X-rays using the ionization produced in a Geiger M ller tube, which gives its name to the instrument. We do not currently
manufacture any of the products that we sell. We intend to continue to target homebuilders and home renovation contractors for the sale
of products and resellers that market to these customers. Our business activities are now focused on expanding our Internet sales. We
have established a fiscal year end of December 31. Initially we sold the products on consignment on behalf of Star Systems Corporation,
a Japanese company owned by Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder, and purchase products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., a Russian company
owned by Alexey Golovanov, our minority shareholder, which we sell to independent third party resellers. Commencing in 2013, we began
selling the products directly to third parties through Internet sales. 

3 

On
November 29, 2011, we issued 1,500 pre-split shares of our no par value common stock, valued at 1 per share, to our 2 founders, which
includes 1,200 pre-split common shares to our chief executive officer, Victor Shvetsky and 300 pre-split common shares to our president,
Alexey Golovanov in exchange for organizational services incurred in our formation valued at 1,200 and 300, respectively. We believe
that our present capital is sufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. However, we believe that we will require
between 70,000 to 400,000 in cash in to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation (See Item 7). To the extent we are unable
to accomplish our goals with the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, then we intend to use our existing cash or raise additional
capital from investors through the sale of our common stock or from loans or advances from our majority shareholder. Our majority shareholder
has orally agreed to advance us the funds without interest and has agreed to defer repayment until we are able to repay him. In the fourth
quarter of 2016, we raised 65,230 from 34 investors through the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement.
No additional funds were raised in 2021 or 2022. 

During
April 2020, we acquired Quarta-Rad USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. There was no consideration paid for
the shares. The purpose of the acquisition is to separate the sales of certain products in separate entities. There was no activity,
assets or liabilities in the subsidiary through December 31, 2022. 

During
December 2020, we acquired Sellavir, Inc, a Delaware corporation, under common control, as a wholly owned subsidiary We acquired the
company in exchange for 333,333 shares on common stock. The value of the stock on the date of issue was approximately 170,000. Sellavir
is a video analytics company whose platform empowers organizations to decode videos to develop creative marketing strategies and analysis
through advanced and proprietary technologies. 

Our
principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801-1186
and our telephone number is (302) 887-9916 and email contact is info@quartarad.com . Our URL address is www.quartarad.com . 

Business 

We
commenced operations in May 2012, by selling products on consignment from a company owned by our majority shareholder. In 2012, we purchased
products from a company owned by our minority shareholder and sold them to a company owned by our majority shareholder and to third party
resellers. We believe the terms of those sales were arms-length. In 2012, we began use of the Internet as well as the services of an
independent sales representative to market the products to homeowners and interested customers in North America and the majority of our
sales were from unrelated third parties. We market the products to homebuilders and home renovation contractors. We have had limited
operations and have limited financial resources. In 2011, our operations were devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational
activities as well as related party and third party sales, which included: 

1. 
 Formation
 of the Company; 

2. 
 Development
 of our business plan; 

3. 
 Evaluating
 various detection devices; 

4. 
 Research
 on marketing channels/strategies for our detection devices and the industry; 

5. 
 Secured
 our website domain www.quartarad.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and 

6. 
 Research
 on future products to distribute. 

7. 
 Consignment
 sales on behalf of a related party. 

8. 
 Sales
 to third party resellers. 

In
May 2012, we commenced our business operations by selling products on consignment from a related party company and developing our distribution
network. In June 2012, we began to utilize our website to market the products we sell on consignment to our potential customers. We also
began implementing our business plan by promoting these products for sale on various websites. We also engaged independent, third party
distributors to sell the products. In 2013, increased our Internet presence and increased our sales whereby the majority of our sales
were from unrelated third parties. From 2014 to the present, we have continued to sell the products through the Internet to unrelated
third parties. In October 2018, our United Kingdom retail platform was suspended due to certain UK restrictions. We are in the process
of becoming compliant in order to lift these restrictions and exploring and testing new partners for EU distribution. We have reserved
 100,000 on our balance sheet as accrued expenses in connection with this matter. 

 The
Company paid 41,822 during 2020, 35,680 during 2021, and 3,783 during 2022 towards the estimated liability, a remainder of 18,715
and 22,498 is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2022. 

We
believe that our principal source of revenue will continue through Sellavir as Quarta-Rad wind down the Internet Sales and sales to resellers
for the following products; 

Radiation
Detection Equipment 

RADEX
RD1503 basic model of a hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market. 

RADEX
RD1706 enhanced model of a hand-held radiation detector; additional radiation counter provides for a more accurate results (confirmed
by JQA Japan Quality Assurance organization), vibration alarm and several additional functions improve on the RD1503 design specifications. 

4 

RADEX
RD1008 high-end radiation detection device that provides readings for Gamma- and Beta- radiation values separately. Equivalent
devices from other manufacturers cost 5-10 times more. 

RADEX
RD1212 new model of hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market. It includes all the functionality of RD1503 model as
well as ability to store measured values in memory for later transfer to PC. This device comes with newly developed software, RadexRead,
developed by Quarta-Rad Inc to further enhances the RADEX family of Geiger counters by combining the power of PC and Internet, allowing
the user to visualize and share their measurements with other RADEX consumers. 

RADEX
RD1212-BT upgraded version of RD1212 with Bluetooth, now capable of linking to smartphones or tablets to transfer data in real
time. Also measures atmospheric pressure and air temperature. Special Android/iOS application for smartphones can be used alongside with
this product. 

RADEX
RD ONE compact personal radiation detector, smaller and less expensive than any of the other models. Besides the size, the device
has additional features such as: counts accumulative dose, can display measurements in CPMs and links via USB cord to PC for data transfer
and analysis. Other standard features include audio/vibration alarm and adjustable alarm thresholds like on all other models. New analytical
software was created to chart and analyze received data. 

Radon

RADEX
M107 simple Radon gas detector that provides visual/audio alarm when a certain (or legal) threshold is reached. 

EMI
Detection Equipment 

RADEX
EMI50 hand-held device that provides real-time measuring of Electric Field Strength (in kiloVolt/meter) and Electro Magnetic
Field (in microTesla). 

Light
and brightness Detection Equipment 

RADEX
Lupin Light Meter, Pulse meter and Lucimeter. A hand-held device that measures illumination, brightness and flicker ratio of LED
screens, any type of light bulbs or monitors at work or at home. RadexLight Software allows PC connection and data transfer. Spectral
sensitivity is identical to a human eye, which separates this model from the competition. 

Although
we have commenced our marketing sales campaign with our own resources and are selling products through online retailers and through resellers,
we believe that we need additional capital to increase our sales and expand our marketing program. Our ability to achieve and maintain
profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to cost effectively purchase and sell the products and market them
through the Internet and through distributors. We intend to rely on our Chairman and President s relationships in the industry
to supply us with products and introduce us to resellers. We also intend to market our website to the home renovation industry to solicit
orders for the sale of products. There can be no guarantee or assurance that our Chairman or President and/or our website will enable
us to purchase products on attractive terms that will allow us to resale them to independent third party distributors. 

No
assurance can be given that the products we purchase will be sold to resellers and, if sold to them, will return an investment or make
a profit. To achieve the goal of purchasing products on favorable terms, we plan to be selective in our choice of suppliers and work
with our shareholders companies as well as other cost-effective suppliers. 

Major
advantages that can be capitalized on immediately are: 

existing
 brand recognition of RADEX name; 

existing
 product line up that can be sold now; 

access
 to device library that are in the prototyping stage for a quicker push into production and sales phases; 

access
 to Quarta-Rad, Ltd. engineers and its proprietary tech library that would allow for quick prototyping and manufacture of devices
 based on reports from the field sales-force; and 

Exclusive
 distribution rights for the RADEX brand in the United States, Canada and the European Union 

Quarta-Rad,
Ltd. s proprietary tech library is combination of source code, database, firmware and hardware used for measuring and displaying
radiation measurements. The source code is for the: (i) RD1212 web program; (ii) RD1212 BT application for Android and iPhone; (iii)
Web RadexRead; and (iv) database of radiation measurements. The Web RadexRead and database of radiation measurements are owned, managed,
and controlled by us. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns and controls the firmware source code used by all Radex series as well as the hardware design.
Victor Shvetsky, our CEO, is in charge of developing and maintaining any technical libraries we own. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns any technical
library components.

Sellavir
Consulting: 

We
expanded our operations through the acquisition of Sellavir Inc in December 2020. Sellavir is an AI company that leverages its knowledge
in neural networks to provide customized AI and development services to our clients. Our services are focused on offering customized
solutions for image processing. Our current business model relies on identifying the specific customer needs and developing a software
solution to address them. We currently do not have any clients in the US, and our sole revenue stream is from our Japanese reseller.
We rely on their sales staff for the identification of new opportunities in the Japanese market. Quarta-Rad has acquired the company
to: 

-
leverage Sellavir capabilities to combine it with its Radex series to offer AI-enhanced radiation detection capabilities 

 -
expand its scope outside the radiation measurement 

Financing
Strategy 

Our
ability to increase our inventory will depend on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting
our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall inventory planning and management will rest with our management. For each detection
device product, we plan to purchase, management will need to assess the market and our financing needs to acquire product at cost-effective
prices. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will
be able to ever purchase product on cost-effect terms or employ independent distributors to effectively sell the products. 

Once
we determine our inventory needs, there are various methods of obtaining the funds needed to complete the purchase of the detection devices.
Examples of financing alternatives include the assignment of our rights to purchase order financing. Alternatively, we may form a limited
liability company or partnership where we will be the managing member or the general partner and raise funds to finance inventory. We
may also obtain favorable pre-sales commitments from various customers such as home restoration contractors, distributors and developers.
These various techniques, which are commonly used in the industry, can be combined to finance our inventory without a major bank financing. 

Distribution
Arrangements 

Effective
distribution is critical to the economic success of the detection devices, particularly when made by a small company without sufficient
marketing resources. We have negotiated a few independent distribution agreements. 

We
intend to continue to distribute the products in the United States through existing independent distributors and the Internet. Our primary
emphasis will be on marketing to homebuilders, home renovation contractors and general contractors. In addition, we intend to also target
direct consumers via the Internet through online retailers and through national and regional retailers. 

To
the extent that we may engage in distribution of the products in foreign markets, we will be subject to all of the additional risks of
doing business abroad including, but not limited to, government censorship, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, greater risk of
 piracy copying, and licensing or qualification fees. 

It
is not possible to predict, with certainty, the nature of the distribution arrangements, if any, that we may secure for the detection
devices we sell. 

We
believe that the catastrophic events such as the March 11, 2011 nuclear accident in Japan will drive consumers and the market to radiation
detection devices and other detection devices will either be in demand from the construction community and will be cost effective for
the consumer and the industry professional. 

We
believe that effective Internet advertising along with participation in trade shows is the quickest and most cost effective method to
let consumers know about the products. Additionally, large resellers and distributors will require promotional packages that we will
need to develop and produce. 

Competition 

The
detection device industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other
resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small
number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as United Technologies Corporation, Radiation Alert, Osun Technologies,
Lutron, General Tools, Mazur Instruments, First Alert, Inc./BRK Brands, Inc., which is wholly owned by Sunbeam Corporation, as well as
many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us. 

6 

The
major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of customer service, the quality of finished products and price.
Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products depends primarily on our manufacturers 
standards and the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver
the Products we sell. We believe we will compete effectively in all of these areas. 

Many
of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may
compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer detection devices at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the
prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to obtain more
experienced employees than we can. 

Intellectual
Property Rights 

We
do not currently have any intellectual property rights. In the summer of 2013, Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director
developed a software program called RadexRead, which Quarta-Rad, Ltd is using in the manufacture of its RD1212 products that we purchase
as party of our inventory. We are not incurring any additional costs or benefits from Mr. Shvetsky s ownership of this software
and, there are no current plans for Mr. Shvetsky to sell the software to the Company or contribute it for additional shares of our common
stock. 

Through
Sellavir, we are in the process of obtaining patents. 

Status
Of Any Publicity Announced New Products and Services 

In
late 2013, we began distributing a new product named RD1212, which we believe has a sleek new design. It has the ability to store measurements
in internal memory and transfer this data to a personal computer PC ). The RadexRead software utilized in this device allows
users to view values retrieved from the Geiger counter, map them on Google Maps, and share their data with other Radex users. 

We
estimate that the cost for us to purchase software from an independent party that performs the same functions as RadexRead would be approximately
 30,000. This software allows us to retrieve data from the RD1212 device to a Windows PC, analyze it, and geo-tag the values and place
them on Google Map. The software offers an interactive view of the world map with readings other Radex RD1212 users can, at their option,
submit. 

We
believe RadexRead brings numerous advantages to us over our competition, specifically: 

RadexRead
 distinguishes the products we sell from other Geiger counters in its price range by providing free visualization software; 

RadexRead,
 to the best of our knowledge, is the only software for Geiger counters in the RD1212 price range that allows users to mark radiation
 values collected by Geiger counters and place them on a map; 

RadexRead
 is the only software in this Geiger counter class that allows users to share their data with each other over the Internet; 

RadexRead
 is designed for use by users with little or no scientific background, making it simple and fun to collect, visualize and share radiation
 measurements with the community; and 

RadexRead
 allows us to further increase its visibility through collaboration with Safecast, a worldwide volunteer organization that collects
 radiation data. RadexRead gives user an option of saving data online and submit its radiation and geographical data shared with other
 users to Safecast monitoring network. 

We
believe RadexRead has increased RADEX s appeal over our competition and helped RD1212 become one of our top selling Geiger counters,
despite the product s manufacturer s suggested retail price being almost forty percent higher than the previous top-selling
device, the low-cost RD1503.

We
are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state
and federal levels. Sales of the products we sell on consignment or sell to independent, third party distributors and services we may
provide internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations
relating to import-export control. Violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from
one or more businesses or the entire corporation. Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our
ability to perform certain international contracts. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in the states we conduct
business and the United States. 

Research
and Development 

From
our inception through September 30, 2014, we have not spent any money on research and development activities. In the fourth quarter of
2014, we began spending money on research and development for a new software program that we may license to others and 155,000 to our
related party supplier for the development of a new product for us to sell. In 2021 and 2022, we spent -0- and -0-, respectively, on
research and development with our related party. We have paid an independent contractor to improve and upgrade our website and Victor
Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director, has developed, at no cost to us, a software program called RadexRead, which we allow
Quarta-Rad, Ltd. to use in the manufacture of the RD1212 products we purchase from them. In 2018, we also entered into an agreement with
our related party developer for 180,000 to develop software for the device RADEX AQ.

In

We

of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. You should refer to the Financial Statements and related Notes
in conjunction with this discussion. 

Results
of Operations 

General 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 29, 2011 with fiscal year end in December 31. We were formed to
distribute and sell detection devices to homeowners and interested consumers in North America. Initially, our business plan was to sell
products on consignment from Star Systems Japan, a corporation owned by our majority shareholder. We purchased these products from Quarta-Rad,
Ltd., a company owned by our minority shareholder. We also targeted direct-to-consumer sales since we believe we can distribute these
products through the Internet. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone
any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of
business. 

As
of the date of this Form 10-K, we continue to expand our operations and expect to increase our revenues with additional working capital
by increasing our advertising and marketing. Our chief executive officer and director, Victor Shvetsky, and our director and president,
Alexey Golovanov, are our only employees. Mr. Shvetsky and Mr. Golovanov will devote at least ten hours per week to us but may increase
the number of hours as necessary. In 2012, Messrs. Shvetsky and Golovanov s companies have been the source of commissionable consignment
sales and we did not carry any inventory. In 2013, we discontinued selling the products on consignment from our majority shareholder s
company for a commission or consignment fee and began purchasing inventory directly from Quarta-Rad, Ltd (Russia) QRR to sell on the Internet to direct consumers and to third party resellers. In 2012, when a reseller placed an order from us we purchased
the product from our related party supplier and have it ship the product directly to the reseller. Beginning in 2013, we began purchasing
the products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., our related party supplier and it shipped the products to us. We then shipped the products to a third
party online retailer, to hold for Internet sales and sales to our third party resellers. 

We
expanded our operations through the acquisition of Sellavir Inc in December 2020. Sellavir is an AI company that leverages its knowledge
in neural networks to provide customized AI and development services to our clients. Our services are focused on offering customized
solutions for image processing. Our current business model relies on identifying the specific customer needs and developing a software
solution to address them. We currently do not have any clients in the US, and our sole revenue stream is from our Japanese reseller.
We will focus on the expansion of this line of business. 

Our
administrative office is located at 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801, which is a virtual office. 

In
2021, we generated 1,245,981 in sales and incurred a net profit of 7,343In 2022, we generated 1,100,431 in sales, and incurred a net
profit of 14,578. We anticipate that we will be able to increase our revenues. We believe that we have sufficient working capital to
continue our operations for the next 12 months; however, we believe that we need to seek additional financing to expand our sales. As
of December 31, 2022, we had 293,878 in cash on hand in our corporate bank account and liabilities of 404,651, which consisted of 134,252
in related party payables, 187,000 in deferred revenue from a related party, and 83,299 in accounts payable and accrued expenses We
currently have two officers and directors. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and devote
approximately 10 hours per week to us. Our sales are to independent, third parties. Since May 2012, we have utilized the services of
an independent contractor to assist us in selling the products. He is paid on a commission only basis. 

In
2018, we continued to focus our business operations on the development of our distribution agreements and reseller network as well as
continue to advertise on the Internet. We plan to continue to utilize our website to promote the products to home renovation contractors
and other purchasers of detection devices. We are promoting the detection products by advertising our website and marketing to independent
distributors and others interested in detection devices. We purchase the products from QRR, which is owned by our minority shareholder
and is the original manufacturer for RADEX product line. Under an oral agreement with QRR, we have the exclusive distribution rights
for sale of QRR products in Europe, the US, and Asia (excluding China) for a period of 10 years which expires in 2027. We sell the products
we purchase from QRR directly to third party buyers and to resellers. The purchase terms require us to prepay for the products we purchase
at a price that is set forth in each purchase order. The product pricing has been discounted pursuant to a discount agreement. We have
extended this agreement thru 2027. During 2019, our ability to sell through our distributor in the UK was suspended due to an ongoing
UK VAT examination, we are currently testing new partners for EU distribution and have resumed UK sales. 

During
December 2011, Quarta-Rad we acquired Sellavir, Inc, a Delaware corporation, under common control, as a wholly owned subsidiary We acquired
the company in exchange for 333,333 shares on common stock. The value of the stock on the date of issue was approximately 170,000. Sellavir
is a video analytics company whose platform empowers organizations to decode videos to develop creative marketing strategies and analysis
through advanced and proprietary technologies. Quarta-Rad has acquired the company to leverage Sellavir capabilities to combine it with
its Radex series to offer AI-enhanced radiation detection capabilities and expand its scope outside the radiation measurement.

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience
and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation
of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily
apparent from other sources. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis
and in the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

11 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). We periodically review the value of items in inventory and provide
write-downs or write-offs of inventory based on its assessment of market conditions. Write-downs and write-offs are charged to cost of
goods sold. Our inventory consists entirely of finished goods available for sale. We analyze our accounts receivable to determine if
a reserve for non-collectible receivables is necessary. There is no allowance recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, together with notes thereto, which are included in this Annual Report on

Liquidity
and Capital Resources . During the year ended December 31, 2022, we used cash for operating expenses from cash on hand and the sale

We
do not have sufficient funds for pursuing our plan of operation, but we are in the process of trying to procure funds sufficient to fund
our operations until we are able to finance our operations through cash flow. There can be no assurance that we will be able to procure
funds sufficient for such purpose. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control) delay our realization
of revenues or cash flows from operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan. Moreover, if our resources from
obtaining additional capital or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy our operational needs or if unexpected
expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise,
we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional
financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable
terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise
respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations
or to remain in business, which could result in a total loss of our stockholders investment. If we raise additional funds through
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly
issued securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. 

The
Company had no formal long-term lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of June 1, 2023. 

The
Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment. 

The
Company has no current plans to make any changes in the number of employees. 

Management
intends to focus on raising funds going forward. The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to raise
funds. Potential investors must be aware if it is unable to raise funds through the sale of its common stock and generate sufficient
revenues, any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety. 

13 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in
the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Income
Tax Expense (Benefit) 

The
Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry forward and startup costs that may offset any
future operating profit. The Company has deferred tax assets of 39,571. 

Impact
of Inflation 

The
Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past year. 

Capital
Expenditures 

The
Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Plan
of Operation 

Our
business strategy is to continue to market our website www.quartarad.com ). We have used our website to market products for sale
to consumers as well to third party distributors. We will continue to strengthen our presence on e-commerce sites. We are also focusing
on expanding our reseller network by targeting large consumer retail chains. 

The
number of detection devices, which we will be able to sell will depend upon the success of our marketing efforts through our website
and the distributors that we will enter into agreement with to sell the products. 

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months: 

Inventory :
We intend to purchase inventory to increase our sales. We believe that these funds will be initially sufficient for us to increase our
inventory from Quarta-Rad, Ltd. The amount needed for inventory purchases is directly related to the demand for sales of our product. 

Marketing :
(Estimated cost 25,000- 100,000). In addition to the website development costs, we intend to increase our marketing efforts on the Internet
to generate leads and sales. We will also utilize funds to develop marketing brochures and materials to market the products to industry
professionals such as home renovation contractors. We intend to market our services through Sellavir to obtain new clients and opportunities. 

Secure
Distribution Agreements : (Estimated cost 10,000). We plan to seek and secure distribution agreements for the sale of our detection
devices. 

Our
management does not anticipate the need to hire additional full or part- time employees over the next six (6) months, as the services
provided by our officers and directors and our independent contractor appear sufficient at this time. We believe that our operations
are currently on a small scale that is manageable by these two individuals as well as our independent contractor. Our management s
responsibilities are mainly administrative at this early stage. While we believe that the addition of employees is not required over
the next six (6) months, the professionals we plan to utilize will be considered independent contractors. We do not intend to enter into
any employment agreements with any of these professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended to be employees of our company. 

We
currently do not own any plants or equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future; we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements;
and we have not paid for expenses on behalf of our directors. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements. The adoption of the new accounting pronouncements is not anticipated to have
a material effect on our operations.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Quarta-Rad, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quarta-Rad, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current year audit of the financial statements that was communicated,
or required to be communicated, to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Related
Party Transactions including Revenue Recognition 

Description
of the Matter: 

As
discussed in Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company generated revenues from a related-party. Our auditing of the recognition
of revenue was complex and is based on a thorough understanding the Company s related party relationships, contracts, and business
activities. These were the principal considerations that led us to determine this as a critical audit matter. 

How
We Addressed the Matter in our Audit: 

We
evaluated the controls over the Company s identification of, and recording of related party transactions, and of the revenue recognition
process, including walkthroughs. To evaluate the related party s satisfaction of performance obligations, our audit procedures
included, among others, reviewing contracts and evaluating management s assumptions used to determine the distinct performance
obligations, and reviewing the final work product provided to the related entity by the Company.

Our
principal activities from which we generate our revenue are product sales. 

Revenue
is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. A contract with a customer exists when we enter into an enforceable
contract with a customer. The contract is based on either the acceptance of standard terms and conditions on the websites for e-commerce
customers and via telephone with our third-party call center for our print media and direct mail customers, or the execution of terms
and conditions contracts with retailers and wholesalers. These contracts define each party s rights, payment terms and other contractual
terms and conditions of the sale. Consideration is typically paid prior to shipment via credit card or check when our products are sold
direct to consumers or approximately 30 days from the time control is transferred when sold to wholesalers, distributors and retailers.
We apply judgment in determining the customer s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including
the customer s historical payment experience and, in some circumstances, published credit and financial information pertaining
to the customer. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product to the customer. Performance obligations promised in
a contract are identified based on the goods that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are
distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
We have concluded the sale of goods and related shipping and handling are accounted for as the single performance obligation. 

The
transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer
receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be
entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We issue refunds to e-commerce and print media customers, upon
request, within 30 days of delivery. We estimate the amount of potential refunds at each reporting period using a portfolio approach
of historical data, adjusted for changes in expected customer experience, including seasonality and changes in economic factors. For
retailers, distributors and wholesalers, we do not offer a right of return or refund and revenue is recognized at the time products are
shipped to customers. In all cases, judgment is required in estimating these reserves. Actual claims for returns could be materially
different from the estimates. A reserve for sales returns and allowances is considered immaterial and, as a result, there was no reserve
for sales returns and allowances, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

We
recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer when product
is shipped. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction,
that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after
control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales. 

We
recognize consulting revenue over time as services are performed.

the third quarter of 2022, Sellavir billed and received 
from a related party for services to be performed, for AI consulting and development, during the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our chief executive officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were not effective in timely alerting them to material information which is required
to be included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC as of the end of the period covering this report and to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There have been no
material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect, or are reasonably
likely to affect, our internal controls over financial reporting during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

(b)
Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term as defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As
of December 31, 2022, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).
 Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective as of December 31, 2022 and identified the material weaknesses described below. 

15 

Description
of Material Weaknesses and Management s Remediation Initiatives 

The
following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting were identified by management and the Company s
independent auditor as of December 31, 2022: 

Ineffective
control environment. The Company did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation necessary for
effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company (i) did not maintain a functioning independent audit
committee; (ii) did not have its Board of Directors review and approve significant transactions; (iii) had an insufficient number of
personnel appropriately qualified to perform control design, execution and monitoring activities; (iv) had an insufficient number of
personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and
SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements; (v) had inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives; (vi) lack of written documentation of the Company s key internal control
policies and procedures over financial reporting (vii) lack of procedures to identify and disclose related party transactions and (viii) lack of procedures to properly
relieve inventory. The Company is required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have
written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting. The Company did not formally document policies and controls
to enable management and other personnel to understand and carry out their internal control responsibilities including the lack of
closing checklists, budget-to-actual analyses, balance sheet variation analysis, and pro-forma financial statements. Additionally,
the Company did not have an adequate process in place to complete its testing and assessment of the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner. 

Ineffective
controls over financial statement close and reporting process. The Company did not maintain effective controls over its financial
statement close and reporting process. Specifically, the Company: (i) had insufficient preparation and review procedures for disclosures
accompanying the Company s financial statements; and (ii) did not provide reasonable assurance that accounts were complete and
accurate and agreed to detailed support and that reconciliations of accounts were properly performed, reviewed and approved; and 

Insufficient
segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel. We do not have sufficient segregation of
duties within accounting functions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had limited personnel that performed nearly all aspects
of our financial reporting process, including, but not limited to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the ability
to post and record journal entries and responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements. Due to the fact that these duties
were often performed by the same person, this creates a lack of review over the financial reporting process that would likely result
in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures
as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements
that would not be prevented or detected. 

16 

As
of the date of this report, our remediation efforts continue related to each of the material weaknesses that we have identified in our
internal control over financial reporting, and additional time and resources will be required in order to fully address these material
weaknesses. We have not been able to complete all actions necessary and test the remediated controls in a manner that would enable us
to conclude that such controls are effective. We are committed to implementing the necessary controls to remediate the material weaknesses
described below as our resources permit. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until (1) the new processes are
designed, appropriately controlled and implemented for a sufficient period of time and (2) we have sufficient evidence that the new processes
and related controls are operating effectively. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

(c)
Changes in internal controls. 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December
31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Mr.
Victor Shvetsky, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer

Possible
Potential Conflicts 

The
OTCBB does not currently have any director independence requirements. 

No
member of management will be required by us to work on a full time basis. Accordingly, certain conflicts of interest may arise between
us and our officer and director in that he may have other business interests in the future to which he devotes his attention, and he
may be expected to continue to do so although management time must also be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest
may arise that can be resolved only through his exercise of such judgment as is consistent with each officer s understanding of
his fiduciary duties to us. In the course of other business activities, they may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate
for presentation to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts of interest in
determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 

In
an effort to resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and sole director have orally agreed that any opportunities that
they are aware of independently or directly through their association with us (as opposed to disclosure to them of such business opportunities
by management or consultants associated with other entities) would be presented by them solely to us. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Currently
we have two officers and directors and will seek to add additional officer(s) and/or director(s) as and when the proper personnel are
located and terms of employment are mutually negotiated and agreed, and we have sufficient capital resources and cash flow to make such
offers. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

On
November 30, 2011, we adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct which is applicable to our future employees, and which also includes
a Code of Ethics for our chief executive and principal financial officers and any persons performing similar functions. A code of ethics
is a written standard designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 

honest
 and ethical conduct, 

18 

full,
 fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in regulatory filings and public statements, 

compliance
 with applicable laws, rules and regulations, 

the
 prompt reporting violation of the code, and 

accountability
 for adherence to the code. 

A
copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 14.1 to our registration
statement. 

Board
of Directors 

Our
directors hold office until the completion of their term of office, which is not longer than one year, or until a successor(s) have been
elected. Our directors term of office expires on April 17, 2023. All officers are appointed annually by the board of directors
and, subject to existing employment agreements (of which there are currently none), serve at the discretion of the board. Currently,
directors receive no compensation for their role as directors but may receive compensation for their role as officers. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

During
the past ten years, no present director, executive officer or person nominated to become a director or an executive officer of us: 

(1) 
 had
 a petition under the federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law filed by or against, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar
 officer appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at
 or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer
 at or within two years before the time of such filing; 

(2) 
 was
 convicted in a criminal proceeding or subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 

(3) 
 was
 subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining him from or otherwise limiting his involvement in any of the following activities: 

i. 
 acting
 as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor commodity pool operator, floor broker, leverage transaction
 merchant, any other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or an associated person of any of the foregoing,
 or as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any
 investment company, bank, savings and loan association or insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice
 in connection with such activity; 

ii. 
 engaging
 in any type of business practice; or 

iii. 
 engaging
 in any activity in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or commodity or in connection with any violation of federal
 or state securities laws or federal commodities laws; or 

(4)
 
 was
 the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of an federal or state authority barring,
 suspending or otherwise limiting for more than 60 days the right of such person to engage in any activity described in paragraph
 (3) (i), above, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; or 

(5)
 
 was
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
 Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and for which the judgment has not been reversed, suspended
 or vacated. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Concurrent
with having sufficient members and resources, our board of directors will establish an audit committee and a compensation committee.
We believe that we will need a minimum of five directors to have effective committee systems. The audit committee will review the results
and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent auditors and review and evaluate the system of internal controls.
The compensation committee will manage any stock option plan we may establish and review and recommend compensation arrangements for
the officers. No final determination has yet been made as to the memberships of these committees or when we will have sufficient members
to establish committees. See Executive Compensation hereinafter. 

19 

We
will reimburse all directors for any expenses incurred in attending directors meetings provided that we have the resources to
pay these fees. We will consider applying for officers and directors liability insurance at such time when we have the resources
to do so.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

Our
promoters are Mr. Shvetsky, our chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and secretary, and Mr. Golovanov, our president. 

Our
office and mailing address is 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801. 

On
November 29, 2011, we issued 12,000,000 post-split shares of our common stock to Victor Shvetsky, our chief executive officer, chief
financial officer, secretary and director and 3,000,000 post-split shares of our common stock to Alexey Golovanov, our president. These
shares were issued in exchange for services valued at 1,200 and 300, respectively or 1.00 per share. 

Our
officers and sole director are required to commit time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating
management time among various business activities. In the course of other business activities, they may become aware of business opportunities
that may be appropriate for presentation to us, as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. As such, there may be conflicts
of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 

In
an effort to resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and directors have orally agreed that any opportunities that
they are aware of independently or directly through their association with us (as opposed to disclosure to them of such business opportunities
by management or consultants associated with other entities) would be presented by them solely to us. 

We
cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Mr.
Golovanov, our president, owns Quarta-Rad, Ltd. Quarta-Rad Russia ), which is part of the International Scientific and
Technical Park of Moscow Engineering and Physical Institute MIFI and which is a developer and manufacturer of radiometric,
acoustical and pyrometric devices, radiation detecting indicators, Radon detecting indicators and acoustical leak detectors that are
used by fuel-energy enterprises of Moscow and other cities of the Russian Federation. In 2011 and 2012, we acted as a consignment agent
and purchased products from Quarta-Rad Russia pursuant to a written agreement and sold the merchandise to Star Systems Japan Corporation,
a company owned by our majority shareholder, Victor Shvetsky. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we purchased 506,834 and
 662,960, respectively, of inventory from Quarta-Rad Russia and, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we owed Quarta-Rad Russia 174,532
and 138,570 in related party payables. In 2017, we entered into an agreement with our related party developer for 180,000 to develop
software for the device RADEX AQ. The amount above due at December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relates to the development contract. 

We
believe that each reported transaction and relationship is on terms that are at least as fair to us as would be expected if those transactions
were negotiated with third parties. 

There
have been no other related party transactions, or any other transactions or relationships required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404
of Regulation S-K. 

With
regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions, including, but not
limited to, the following: 

disclose
 such transactions in prospectuses where required; 

disclose
 in any and all filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, where required; 

obtain
 disinterested directors consent; and 

obtain
 shareholder consent where required.

Item
14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

Commission and other services that are normally provided for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in connection with statutory
and regulatory filings or engagements. 

Audit
Related Fees . None. 

Policy
on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of Services Performed by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Our
board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. All of the above services
and fees were reviewed and approved by our board of directors before the respective services were rendered. 

For
the 2022 and 2021 audits, our Director has considered the nature and amount of fees billed or expected to be billed by DBB McKennon,
and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit was compatible with maintaining DBB s independence.
