Overview 

Boon
Industries, Inc. is a bioscience company that manufactures commercial chemical products with various
applications in commercial sterilization for agriculture, warehousing, hospitality and medical facilities . DiOx+, our flagship
product, is a disinfectant sterilizer that kills harmful pathogens without dangerous toxic exposure to the user or the environment. DiOx+
is an activated chlorine dioxide (Cl02) broad spectrum disinfectant that helps protect the environment and human health from viruses,
bacteria and harmful by-products left by other cleaning sanitizers, without a harsh smell or skin irritation. 

Our
proprietary chemical formulas and processes make DiOx+ ideal for sterilizing mission critical, high value medical equipment and disinfecting
air and surfaces in laboratory and hospital environments. DiOx+ helps protect agricultural crops from disease, can be used in water treatment
systems, and helps reduce operational costs in warehousing, distribution centers, and ecommerce support facilities. 

We
manufacture DiOx+ in the U.S. at our production facility located in Grass Valley, California. 

The
Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Matrix of Life Tech Trust, works with Boon with applications in the beverage and nutritional
supplement industries, and water bottling operations in Grants Pass, Oregon, where it produces bottled water and a range of products
for the health and wellness industry. 

Boon
Industries Inc also provides modified shipping containers outfitted for agricultural purposes. These units offer solutions for several
different segments within the agricultural industry and can be designed to accommodate a variety of uses. 

On
October 1, 2022, the Company executed a share exchange agreement with Cal Care Group, Inc. Cal Care ), a California Corporation
with products and services in the cannabis retail, manufacturing, distribution, and delivery. Cal Care is a product and brand marketing
company investing in operations with disruptive or hyper growth potential. Headquartered in San Jacinto, California, Cal Care s core
strategic business is its end-market access as a central player in the growing California cannabis delivery marketplace while developing
its in-house cannabis production capacity to verticalize operations in the space. The Company intends to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Cal Care in exchange for 500,000 Series A preferred shares of the Company. The transaction will only become effective
upon exchange of the agreed upon consideration, which has not occurred at December 31, 2022. Both parties can unilaterally terminate
such agreement until the agreed upon consideration is exchanged. 

Holding
Company Parent Subsidiary Formation 

Boon
is the successor issuer of Leaf of Faith Beverage, Inc. LOFB ), as a result of a holding company reorganization effected
by a merger (the Holding Company Merger on March 2, 2020, under which LOFB merged with and into Leaf of Faith Beverage
Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Boon, which in turn was a wholly owned subsidiary of LOFB. The Holding Company Merger
was effected pursuant Section 1080(g) of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act (the Oklahoma Act ), under which wholly owned
subsidiaries may merge to effect a holding company structure without requiring a stockholder vote. 

Matrix
of Life Trust Acquisition 

On
March 2, 2020, following the Holding Company Merger, we purchased all the assets, and assumed all of the liabilities of Matrix of Life
Tech Trust, an Oregon Trust, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 10, 2020 (the Matrix Acquisition ).
In connection with the Matrix Acquisition, Justin Gonzalez, the trustee, and sole beneficiary of Matrix of Life Tech Trust, was appointed
our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Prior to the Matrix Acquisition, Matrix produced beverages and food products at a facility
leased in Grants Pass, Oregon. As a result of the Matrix Acquisition, our business became the business previously conducted by Matrix.
Following the Matrix Acquisition, we have expanded Matrix s business of manufacturing customized white label products
for the food and beverage industry to focus on the distribution of our DiOx+ product. 

4 

Matrix
of Life Tech Trust (the Trust was established in October of 2011 by Justin Gonzalez, as trustee, for the benefit of his
children to develop proprietary technologies in emulsification with applications in the beverage and nutritional supplement industries.
The Trust was initially funded by cash from Mr. Gonzalez to engage in its business. Beginning in 2012 the Trust conducted water bottling
operations in Grants Pass, Oregon, where it produced bottled water and a range of products for the health and wellness industry, until
the sale of its assets to us in March 2020. 

Our
Market Opportunity 

The
market opportunity for Boon Industries DiOx+ product includes key sectors that require effective disinfecting and sterilizing
of air, surfaces, and equipment. The growth in these markets has been substantial since 2020, and the outlook continues to grow following
the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global sterilization equipment and disinfectants market is expected to grow from 7 billion
in 2019 to 9 billion in 2023, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4 . In 2020, the sterilization equipment market was valued at 8
billion, driven by increased demand for sterilization equipment, disinfectants, and critical care equipment due to COVID-19. The U.S.
surface disinfectant market size was valued at 987 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.2 
from 2020 to 2027. 

The
surface disinfectants market is projected to grow substantially due to strict regulations for the use of surface disinfectants, rising
awareness among consumers regarding hygiene, and increasing cases of chronic diseases. The market is further driven by the rising incidences
of disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a steep rise in the demand for surface disinfectants from hospitals.
Chemical disinfectants have emerged as the largest composition segment, with growing demand for disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium
compounds and alcohols. Due to the rising awareness about the effects of the toxic nature of some of the chemical-based products and
the many recalls that have occurred recently, our product s non-toxic yet highly effective dynamic is expected to provide a critical
competitive advantage for our product line, which is based on protecting the health of people and the environment with an eco-friendly
chlorine dioxide solution and its oxidizing properties. 

In
addition, we anticipate that our California base will provide us with access and exposure to the nation s most significant agriculture
market. Protecting agriculture from disease and providing farmers with cost-effective solutions to protect, process and clean crops represents
a significant opportunity for us. In California alone, crops are a 50+ billion business, including exports that topped 21 billion in
2019. Grape production generated 5.4 billion in 2019 and almond production resulted in 6.1 billion in cash receipts. California accounts
for 40 percent of all organic production in the U.S. and organic sales grew to 10.4 billion in 2019. Boon is targeting farms in California s
central valley to develop pilot projects around protecting the food supply from the devasting impacts of pests, viruses and diseases.
These efforts include touch points in the fields, at the processing plants and in the transportation system

Beyond
high value medical equipment and agriculture, the potential market for DiOx+ includes segments that touch business and consumers every
day in a multitude of ways. From hospitals, medical centers, EMS/first responder facilities and equipment, to physician and dental offices.
Hospitality settings like hotels and restaurants to large stadiums and arenas. All these segments are expected to adhere to significant
sanitization, disinfecting and sterilizing protocols in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial buildings, manufacturing and warehouse
facilities, and food processing plants will also be operating under a new normal with their own unique set of operational
requirements. 

Chlorine
Dioxide A Powerful Disinfectant: The antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-mold and biofilm destroying properties of chlorine dioxide
are used in many industrial applications where efficiency, speed of action, and no residues are key. Chlorine dioxide is used as a disinfectant
in food processing, air disinfection and odor control, disinfection of premises as well as vehicles, water treatment including drinking
water and swimming pools, mold eradication, health applications such as dental treatments, wound cleansing, and eye therapies, among
others. Chlorine dioxide was first discovered by Sir Humphry Davy in 1811 when he added sulfuric acid (HYSON) to potassium chlorate (KClO3). 

Agriculture
Vertical 

On
May 13, 2020, we entered into an exclusive distribution and licensing agreement with C Group LLC under which we intend to sell indoor
agricultural growing pods utilizing C-Group s proprietary technology to our existing and future customers. The growing pods are
a self-contained 800 Sq. ft steel container consisting of computerized climate and irrigation control. C Group LLC is manufacturing the
pods. 

The
distribution agreement is for an initial term of five years and provides for an automatic five-year renewal period unless C Group provides
us with notice of non-renewal at least six months prior to the end of the initial term. Either party may terminate the agreement upon
a material breach by the other party. In addition, C Group may terminate the agreement without cause during the five-year extension period
upon six months notice to us. Pursuant to this agreement, we issued 300,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to Anthony
Super, the President of C Group LLC. 

Industry
Overview 

Since
the FDA approved usage of chlorine dioxide under Title 21 in 2016, there have been a handful of companies that have begun to offer chlorine
dioxide products. There are three main types of chlorine dioxide available in the market, and each have their pros and cons: 

Gaseous
 chloring dioxide. 

Stabilized
 chlorine dioxide, and 

Activated
 chlorine dioxide (in solution), such as DiOx+. 

Gaseous
Chlorine Dioxide 

Chlorine
dioxide gas is generally created in situ using ClO2 gas electrochemical or electrolytic generators, or by mixing two incompatible chemicals
that as a result produce chlorine dioxide gas. Since the gas cannot be compressed or stored, the generators are usually installed on
location and used as a chlorine dioxide feed for immediate application. A wide range of companies offer equipment and/or services for
on-site disinfection. 

Stabilized
Chlorine Dioxide 

Stabilized
chlorine dioxide can be produced by chemically mixing sodium chlorite with other compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); however,
they are either not chlorine dioxide per se (ClO2, which is a gas), or the ingredients to create the actual gas have not been mixed and
will be mixed to produce ClO2 when in contact with water. 

6 

Activated
Chlorine Dioxide (in solution) (DiOx+) 

Chlorine
dioxide is usually produced as a gas dissolved in a water solution starting with a sodium chlorite solution and one of the following
methods: reaction with chlorine gas, or reaction with sodium hypochlorite and an acid, or reaction with an acid, typically hydrochloric
acid. Efficient generation of chlorine dioxide is reliant on proper precursor ratios and mixing for a given method. 

When
chlorine dioxide is generated in solution, it is a very effective liquid disinfectant at point of use. Chlorine dioxide at use concentrations
(0.5 .85 ppm) overcomes some of the disadvantages of hypochlorite in that it is non tainting, noncorrosive, and nontoxic. Its sole
use at present is in water disinfection. Unlike iodine, chlorine dioxide has no adverse effects on thyroid function. Chlorine dioxide
is widely used by municipal water treatment facilities. The term chlorine dioxide is misleading because chlorine is not
the active element. Chlorine dioxide is an oxidizing, not a chlorinating agent, and it acts by means of a reduction-oxidation (redox)
electro-chemical reaction. 

Chlorine
Dioxide Market 

The
global chlorine dioxide market size was over 795 million in 2019 and is estimated to grow at over 5 CAGR between 2020 and 2026 owing
to significant expansion of the industrial wastewater treatment sector. Growing regulatory restrictions on the usage of chlorine and
hypochlorite in pulp bleaching should boost the adoption of chlorine dioxide. 

The
product is witnessing rising demand in several industries including the pulp and paper industry owing to the growing adoption of paper
packaging products on account of the significant expansion of the retail and e-commerce sector. The growing demand for pulp from the
textile industry and increasing consumer preference for personal hygiene products such as tissue papers and disposable towels should
further drive the chlorine dioxide market growth. Stabilized chlorine dioxide is an ideal ingredient of the pulp bleaching process to
produce pulp with higher brightness. Under FDA regulations, chlorine dioxide may legally be used as a food additive provided it is obtained
by prescribed production methods such as the electrolysis of sodium chlorite, or the treatment of sodium chlorate with hydrogen peroxide
(which is a stabilized form of chlorine dioxide, and not ClO2 gas, and has its issues with higher corrosiveness and residual remains).
The regulation allows chlorine dioxide to be used as an antimicrobial agent in water for washing fruits and vegetables or poultry processing
in a concentration not exceeding 3 parts per million. 

Chlorine
dioxide consumption in industrial water treatment applications is expected to surpass 125 kilotons by 2026. Growing industrialization
and urbanization has contributed to water pollution thereby increasing the requirement for industrial water treatment. Industrial processes
require water with specific pH levels, water hardness and total dissolved solids (TDS) as the raw water intake involves water of varying
compositions such as freshwater, seawater and groundwater. Chlorine dioxide serves as an effective biocide in the treatment of process
water, food processing and cooling towers (in the latter to control biofilm which leads to legionnaire s disease). 

The
voluminous amount of water required in industrial processes coupled with the adverse effects of contaminated water on industrial equipment
such as lodging of debris and chemical contamination, should drive product demand. Rising water shortage has increased consumer focus
on water reuse, which requires appropriate water treatment. Growing technological advancement in the industrial wastewater treatment
industry along with significant expansion of the electronics sector has increased the requirement for treatment solutions to remove exotic
metals should boost the chlorine dioxide market growth. 

Improving
Air Quality 

In
a recent study, chlorine dioxide gas efficiently disinfected and improved air quality indoors after single (0.28L solution, 250 mg/L),
double, and triple doses. All three doses reduced indoor bacteria and fungi concentrations, but the double and triple doses had significantly
better antimicrobial effects. 

In
another study, a chlorine dioxide-based agent was more effective than hydrogen peroxide at killing bacteria that had enhanced resistance
to chemical and radiation disinfection (B. pumilus SAFR-032 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051). Chlorine dioxide can help sterilize peroxide-
and UV-resistant spores in hospital environments. 

7 

Antiviral
Activity 

Chlorine
dioxide is also antiviral. It destroys the proteins on the outside of viruses and degrades the virus. Chlorine dioxide gas has been shown
to be effective against these viruses on hard, non-porous surfaces: 

Human
 influenza (IFV) 

Measles 

Human
 herpes (HHV) 

Human
 adenovirus (HAdVs) 

Influenza
 A (in mice) 

Chlorine
dioxide solution also inactivated human and monkey rotaviruses (that cause diarrhea) and hepatitis A. 

Government
Regulation 

The
Environmental Protection Agency EPA registered chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant and sanitizer in 1967. In 1983, the
EPA recommended chlorine dioxide as an alternative to chlorine (which was linked to cancer causing THMs) to disinfect water. Use of chlorine
dioxide as a disinfectant and sterilizer accelerated across the beverage industry, fruit and vegetable processing, and pulp and paper
in 1990s. There are various forms in which chlorine dioxide can be produced, with various degrees of purity, concentration, and applicability.
In the United States, chlorine dioxide is approved for use by OSHA, FDA, EPA, CDC, USDA, and DOT. 

List
N Designation 

We
intend to apply for List N designation of DiOx+ from the EPA List N is a publicly available list maintained by the EPA of products that
the EPA expects will kill SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, when used according to the products label directions.
All products on this list meet EPA s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Products qualify for List N if they: 

Demonstrate
 efficacy against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). 

Demonstrate
 efficacy against a pathogen that is harder to kill than SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19); or 

Demonstrate
 efficacy against a different human coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). 

We
believe our DiOx+ meets all the foregoing criteria and have been working with independent laboratories and consultants to obtain List
N designation from the EPA of our DiOx+ products. We have conducted studies with Microchem Labs in Round Rock, Texas and Q Labs in Cincinnati,
Ohio that support the efficacy of our DiOx+ products and conformity to EPA requirements. We expect to obtain the List N designation from
the EPA in the first half of 2022. We believe that once we have obtained List N designation, we will see greatly increased demand for
DiOx+ from government purchasers, contractors, hospitals, and other consumers.

purchase raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers, including Uline and Amazon. Our largest material cost is for the bottles
and containers in which our products are sold. We do not consider Uline or Amazon or any particular supplier to be a principal supplier
or material to our business. Although we do not have long term contracts with any of our suppliers, we believe we have good relationships
with our suppliers, and if necessary, we believe we could replace one or more of our current suppliers with minimal effect on our business
operations. 

Competition 

The
disinfectant and chlorine dioxide industries are subject to intense competition. Many of our competitors are larger companies whose financial
resources and scope of operations are substantially greater than ours. Our competitors that produce chlorine dioxide include International
Dioxide, Ecolab, Grundfos, ProMinent, Evoqua, and Scotmas. Various manufacturers are engaged in consolidation through joint ventures,
mergers, and acquisitions, which should boost their market share and make it more difficult to compete with them. We also face competition
from companies that engage in research and development activities to develop new products that compete with our products. However, we
believe our DiOx+ product offers a superior, more concentrated formulation, that will expand use applications and allow us to penetrate
markets not currently occupied by our competitors. Our current competitors offer ready to use formulas or concentrates with concentrations
of up to 3,000 parts per million (ppm). In contrast, our product is a 4,000 ppm solution, which allows for a greater dilution factor
and potential cost savings for many applications.

Intellectual
Property 

Our
success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely
on a combination of trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, intellectual property
licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. 

In
addition to our own proprietary formulas, we are a party to an Exclusive Technology License Agreement with Eaucentrix LLC which provides
us the exclusive license for the use of proprietary formulas developed by Eaucentrix. The Exclusive Technology License Agreement has
a perpetual term, subject to the right of Eaucentrix to terminate the agreement upon a material breach by us which we fail to cure following
notice from Eaucentrix, or our failure to pay amounts due to Eaucentrix under the agreement for more than 60 days after such payments
become due. 

We
registered DiOx+ as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on June 8, 2020. 

We
are currently applying for a product registration with the EPA that includes a Confidential Statement of Formula that outlines the proprietary
formula. 

We
currently do not hold any patents or other registered intellectual property other than our DiOx+ trademark. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had two full-time employees. 

Emerging
Growth Company 

We
are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 

(a) 
 The
 last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it has total annual gross revenues of 1,000,000. 

(b) 
 The
 last date of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities
 pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement. 

(c) 
 The
 date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; or 

(d) 
 The
 date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large-accelerated filer. 

As
an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information
in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This
statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting
firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures
for financial reporting. 

As
an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the
shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of
the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public
and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not
be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Approximate
Number of Equity Security Holders 

As
of April [], 2023, there were approximately 353 stockholders of record. Because shares of our common stock are held by depositaries,
brokers and other nominees, the number of beneficial holders of our shares is substantially larger than the number of stockholders of
record. 

Dividends 

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available.
We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and
expansion of our business. Consequently, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock to our stockholders for the
foreseeable future. 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 

We
do not have in effect any compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,929,176,111 shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion
of 254,058 Series A Preferred stock. 

The
above issuances of were exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2), and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.
These securities qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act since the issuance securities by us did not involve
a public offering. The offering was not a public offering as defined in Section 4(2) due to the insubstantial number of
persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of securities offered. We did not undertake an
offering in which we sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, these stockholders had the necessary
investment intent as required by Section 4(2) since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such
securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately
redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a public offering. Based on an analysis of the above factors,
we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for this transaction.

Revenue 

Revenue
decreased by 51,825 or 60 from the previous year to 34,434 during the current year compared to 86,259 during the previous year. The
decrease is due to the ongoing negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021,
the Company recognized approximately one time 23,000 of additional revenue related to packaging and shipping services of product for
a third-party customer, which did not occur during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Cost
of Revenue 

The
Company s cost of sales was 12,514 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 18,432 or approximately 59.6 , compared
to 30,946 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cost of revenue was due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting
decrease in revenue. Gross profit remained consistent year over year at 63.7 and 64.1 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were 2,301,603 and 4,831,548, respectively. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in share-based compensation expense by approximately 2.9 million resulting from the fair value
of shares of common stock issued to our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Operating Officer pursuant to their respective
employment agreements and the issuance of shares of common stock and Series A Preferred stock pursuant to the asset purchase agreement
with Matrix Of Life Tech Trust, offset by an increase of advertising and marketing expense by 0.2 million. 

Other
Expense 

Other
expenses were 2,520,514 and 1,093,791 for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 

Other
expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted of 1,908,043 of expense resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives,
 1,218,906 of interest expense, and 1,588,140 of loss on Series A Preferred Stock conversion to common stock, offset by 2,194,575 of
gain on debt conversion. 

Other
expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, consisted of 1,955,459 of income resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives,
 1,157,166 of interest expense, 134,379 of gain on debt conversion, and 2,026,463 of loss on Series A Preferred Stock conversion to
common stock.

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 4,800,197, compared with 5,870,026 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase
in our net loss resulted from the reasons outlined above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
working capital deficiency as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, was as follows:

 Working Capital Deficit 
 (70,769,910 
 (71,499,776 

The
overall working capital deficit decreased from 71,499,776 at December 31, 2021, to 70,769,910 at December 31, 2022. The current liabilities
primarily consist of loans payable, convertible notes payable, derivative liability from the bifurcated conversion feature embedded in
the hybrid debt instruments, related party liabilities, and liability-classified Series A Preferred Stock. The decrease in working capital
deficit is mainly attributable to the conversion of Series A Preferred Stock to common stock in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Going
Concern 

Since
January 1, 2022, and through December 31, 2022, the Company has raised approximately 0.2 million in debt transactions. These funds have
been used to fund on-going corporate operations. Our accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business for
the twelve-month period following the date of these financial statements. Our cash on hand at December 31, 2022 was less than 1,000.
The Company has incurred substantial losses since inception. Its current liabilities exceed its current assets and available cash is
not sufficient to fund expected future operations. The Company is contemplating raising additional capital through debt and equity in
order to continue the funding of its operations, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. However,
there is no assurance that the Company can raise sufficient funds or generate sufficient revenues to pay its obligations as they become
due, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement
its business plan. 

The
Company requires additional capital to fully execute its marketing program and fund its current operations and development. Presently
we are relying on raising additional funding to meet operational shortfalls. There can be no assurance that continued funding will be
available on satisfactory terms. We intend to raise additional capital through the sale of equity, loans, or other short-term financing
options. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

13 

Seasonality 

Management
does not believe that our current business segment is seasonal to any material extent. 

Significant
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related
to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty liabilities, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We
base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent
degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results
and financial position. We believe that the significant accounting policies and assumptions as detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements
contained herein may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Boon Industries, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boon Industries, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements
of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
Company s convertible notes payable and other loans payable approximates the fair value of such liabilities based upon management s
best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements and due to the short-term nature
of these instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The
fair value of the Company s recorded derivative liability is determined based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated
by market data, which require a Level 3 classification. A Black-Sholes option valuation model was used to determine the fair value. The
Company records derivative liability on the balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statements of operation.

The
assumptions used in determining fair value represent management s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if factors change, including changes in the market value of the Company s
common stock, managements assessment or significant fluctuations in the volatility of the trading market for the Company s
common stock, the Company s fair value estimates could be materially different in the future. 

The
Company computes the fair value of the derivative liability at each reporting period and the change in the fair value is recorded as
non-cash expense or non-cash income. The key component in the value of the derivative liability is the Company s stock price, which
is subject to significant fluctuation and is not under its control, and the assessment of volatility. The resulting effect on net loss
is therefore subject to significant fluctuation and will continue to be so until the Company s variable debentures, which the convertible
feature is associated with, are converted into common stock or paid in full with cash. Assuming all other fair value inputs remain constant,
the Company will record non-cash expense when its stock price increases and non-cash income when its stock price decreases. 

ASC
815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity provides that, among other things, generally, if
an event is not within the entity s control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset

and of revenue, respectively. 

If
the Company is not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of the Company s business plan will be impaired. There
are no assurances, however, that management will be able to raise capital or debt on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company
is unable to obtain sufficient additional capital, the Company may be required to reduce the near-term scope of its planned development
and operations, which could delay implementation of the Company s business plan and harm its business, financial condition, and
operating results. The balance sheets do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

Paul
Goyette , Director 

Pursuant
to his director agreement, Paul Goyette will be paid a cash fee of 2,000 per meeting and be issued 10,000 shares of the Company s
Series A Preferred Stock for stated value of 100,000. No shares of Series A were issued as of December 31, 2022. The Company accrued 100,000 of stock payable as of December 31, 2022, which is presented under stock payable in the Company shareholders deficit. 

to shares authorized. The Company s preferred stock at December 31, 2022, consisted
of authorized Series A preferred shares, and Series B preferred shares, all with a par value of per share. 

As
of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding and
 and of Series B Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, respectively. 

Series
A 

The
Series A preferred stock Series A have no voting rights and have no dividends and in the event of a voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, each share of Series A has a stated value of 10 per share. Each share of Series
A is convertible to common stock at the closing price of common on the date of conversion based on the stated value of 10 per share. 

The
Company currently does not have a sufficient number of unissued authorized shares of common stock to permit the conversion of all of
the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 26,670,312,307 shares of common stock available
for issuance. Based on the closing price of our common stock of 0.0002 per share as of December 31, 2022, the 6,662,422 shares of Series
A Preferred Stock outstanding on such date would convert into approximately 333,121,100,000 shares of common stock. 

The
Company follows ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity in its evaluation of the accounting for the Series A
Preferred Stock. ASC 480-10-25-14 requires liability accounting for certain financial instruments, including shares that embody an unconditional
obligation to transfer a variable number of shares, provided that the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly
on one of the following three characteristics: 

A
fixed monetary amount known at inception. 

Variations
in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares; or 

Variations
in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares, but the monetary value to the counterparty moves in the opposite direction as
the value of the issuer s shares. 

The
number of shares delivered is determined on the basis of (1) the fixed monetary amount determined as the stated value and (2) the current
stock price at settlement, so that the aggregate fair value of the shares delivered equals the monetary value of the obligation, which
is fixed or predominantly fixed. Accordingly, the holder is not significantly exposed to gains and losses attributable to changes in
the fair value of the Company s equity shares. Instead, the Company is using its own equity shares as currency to settle a monetary
obligation. 

The
Series A Preferred Stock has been classified as a liability in accordance with ASC 480-10 and the Company has elected to record the Series
A Preferred Stock at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings.

Item
9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
of controls and procedures. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports, filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance,
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

As
required by the SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022, at the reasonable assurance level due
to the material weaknesses described below. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard
No. 2) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified the following two material weaknesses which
have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable
assurance level: 

1.
We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December
31, 2022. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our
assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material
weakness. 

2.
We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature,
segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible,
the authorization of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.
The recording of transactions function is maintained by a third-party consulting firm whereas authorization and custody remains under
the Company s Chief Executive Officer s responsibility. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation
of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented
a material weakness. 

To
address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements
included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

This
annual report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation
report of the company s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for newly public companies. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting. 

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Annual Report
on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Board
Committees and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We
do not currently have a standing audit, nominating or compensation committee of the board of directors, or any committee performing similar
functions. Our board of directors performs the functions of audit, nominating and compensation committees. As of the date of this report,

Role
in Risk Oversight 

Our
board is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes. The board receives and reviews periodic reports from management,
auditors, legal counsel, and others, as considered appropriate regarding our company s assessment of risks. The board focuses on
the most significant risks facing our company and our company s general risk management strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken
by our company are consistent with the board s appetite for risk. While the board oversees our company s risk management,
management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective
approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our board leadership structure supports this approach.

known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock or Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) each executive officer

In

the voting of such security, or the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial
owner of any securities of which the person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days, through the exercise of a warrant
or stock option, conversion of a convertible security or otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, each person in the table will have sole
voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. For purposes of this table, shares not outstanding which are subject to
issuance on exercises of stock options or conversion of a warrant that are held by a person are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose
of computing the percentage of outstanding shares beneficially owned by such person but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose
of computing the percentage for any other person.

Director
Independence 

Our
Common Stock is not quoted or listed on any national exchange or interdealer quotation system with a requirement that a majority of our
board of directors be independent and therefore, the Company is not subject to any director independence requirements. Under NASDAQ Rule

Under such definition our two officers (William Reed and Justin Gonzalez) would not be considered an independent director.

Company hired two independent directors Edouard Beaudette and Johann Loewen, respectively on October 15, 2021, and September 22, 2021,
respectively. On August 3, 2022, Edouard Beaudette submitted a letter of resignation, resigning as a director of the Company effective
