ITEM
 1. BUSINESS 

 As
used herein, the terms DIHG , we , us , our , or the Company refer to Direct Investment Holdings
Group, Inc. a Nevada corporation organized on December 19, 1996. Direct Investment Holdings Group, Inc (DIHG) is the successor-in-interest
to WESPAC Investors Trust III, a California real estate investment trust WESPAC originally established August 22, 1983.
The Company s fiscal year ends December 31 of each year. 

 Prior
to January 1, 1997, the Company s business consisted of the management and operation of three motel properties in the Spokane,
Washington area. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company, through its subsidiaries, engaged in property
management, and real estate brokerage services. Between October 1999 and May 2004, the Company and its subsidiaries conducted no substantial
business, but remained available to engage in property management and real estate brokerage activities. 

 Effective

Texas corporation Carmel and a 99 limited partnership interest in Carmel Realty Services, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership CRSL for an aggregate sale price of 2,072,540 (a basis equivalent to ten times capitalization of the management fees
collected by Carmel and CRSL during 2003) to Regis. Regis paid cash of 250,000 to the Company and delivered a promissory note dated
May 1, 2004 in the stated principal amount of 1,822,540 payable to the order of the Company on demand or, if no demand is made prior
thereto, on December 31, 2011, with interest payable monthly as it accrues. This loan has been extended to December 31, 2021. Such promissory
note is secured by a pledge of the common stock of Carmel and the partnership interest of CRSL sold.

ITEM
 1A. RISK FACTORS 

 An
investment in equity securities of the Company involves a high degree of risk as there is no active trading market for our securities
and liquidity is not assured. You should carefully consider the following information keeping in mind that the matters described below
are not the only potential risks that may affect the Company. Additional risks, which we do not presently consider material or of which
we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact upon us. 

We
are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and across our portfolio. While we did not
experience significant disruptions during 2022 from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic
will have on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. 

Our
governing documents contain anti-takeover provisions that make it difficult for a third party to seek to acquire control of the Company. 

 Certain
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Nevada law could, together or separately, discourage, delay or prevent a third
party from acquiring the Company, even if doing so might benefit stockholders. The provisions may also affect the price investors might
be able to receive for their shares of the Company s common stock. Examples of these provisions are:

The
 right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges, which are senior to the common stock, without
 prior stockholder approval. 

Certain
 limitations upon the stockholders to make, adopt, alter, amend, change, or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation except by a vote
 of 66 2/3 of the holders of record of shares outstanding. 

So-called
 business combination control requirements when the combination involves the Company and a person that beneficially owns 20 
 or more of the outstanding common stock, except under certain circumstances. 

There
is no established independent trading market for the shares of common stock of the Company. 

No trading market presently exists for the shares of common stock and its value is therefore not determinable. Holders of our common
stock do not have a vested right to redeem their shares, and therefore may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of
an emergency or otherwise. There simply is no active trading market for the shares of common stock, and accordingly, the transferability
of such shares is limited at best. 

The Company is managed by the Board of Directors.

Management has established the operating policies and procedures of the Company, which may be modified or waived by the Board of Directors
without stockholder approval. The ultimate effect of any such changes may adversely affect future operations. The Company business is
conducted so as not to become a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act, which exempt entities that are primarily
engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate . 

The Company s primary source of income is from a mortgage
note receivable from a non-related party. Prior to 2022, our primary source of income was from related party.

5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Pursuant to the requirements of NRS 78.2055, on June 7, 2004, the members of the Board of Directors of the Company proposed and recommended
to the stockholders a reverse-split on a 1-for-10 basis of the shares of Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share without any adjustment
to the par value per share and without any reduction in the authorized number of shares of Common Stock at the same par value. The recommendation
was submitted to the holder of approximately 75 of the outstanding Common Stock, Nevada Sea Investments, Inc. Nevada Sea ),
which executed a written consent dated June 8, 2004, pursuant to NRS 78.320 adopting and approving the 1-for-10 reverse stock-split of
the shares of Common Stock without any change in the par value and without any reduction in the authorized number of shares of Common
Stock of the Company pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation. The 1-for-10 reverse stock split was ultimately effective July 12, 2004,
following the distribution of an Information Statement on Schedule 14C to the other stockholders of the Company, and following the filing
of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of State of Nevada. The CUSIP Number for the post-split
shares is 320097-20-7. 

 Under
the approved action, based upon the 10,570,944 old shares outstanding on the effective date of July 12, 2004, the 1-for-10 reverse stock-split
decreased the number of outstanding shares by approximately 90 which, after giving effect to an upward adjustment or rounding up 
for any fractional shares, added 534 shares to result in 1,057,628 post-split shares outstanding. The 1-for-10 reverse stock-split did
not adversely affect any stockholder s proportionate equity interest in the Company, subject to the provisions for elimination of fractional
shares by rounding up to the next whole share which slightly increased the proportionate holdings of all stockholders other than Nevada
Sea. Each post-split share continues to be entitled to one vote, as was the case with each outstanding old share. 

 In
connection with the implementation of a 1-for-10 reverse stock-split, no certificate or script representing any fractional share interest
was issued, but a holder of the old shares received in lieu of any fraction of a post-split share to which the holder would otherwise
have been entitled a single, whole post-split share on a rounding up basis without regard to any price. The result of this rounding
up process increased slightly the holdings of those stockholders who held a number of old shares which were not evenly divisible
by ten, resulting in an increase of 534 shares. 

DIHG s
(formerly FEPI) old shares of Common Stock, while available for trading in the over-the-counter market, to the knowledge of Management,
have not had any material trading activity since their initial issuance in 1997. The old shares were issued pursuant to the terms of
the Modified Plan in the bankruptcy proceeding styled In Re: WESPAC Investors Trust III , Case No. 94-00228-K-11 in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The CUSIP Number of the old shares was 320097-10-8. The shares of beneficial
interest of WESPAC Investors Trust III traded through the first quarter of 1988, and at one time, were quoted on the National Association
of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System NASDAQ ). Since the cessation of trading on NASDAQ, there has been no established,
independent trading market for the shares of beneficial interest of WESPAC or the old shares of Common Stock of Direct Investment Holdings
Group, Inc. (formerly, First Equity Properties, Inc.) as the successor, or the new shares of Common Stock of the Company after giving
effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split. 

5 

No
cash dividends have been declared or paid during the period from January 1, 1994 to the present on either the shares of Beneficial Interest
of the Trust or the old shares of Common Stock of Direct Investment Holdings Group, Inc. (formerly, First Equity Properties, Inc.) as
the successor or the new shares of Common Stock after giving effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split. 

 As
of December 31, 2022, the 1,057,628 post-split shares of Common Stock of Direct Investment Holdings Group, Inc. (formerly, First Equity
Properties, Inc.) issued and outstanding were held by approximately 600 holders of record. 

 During
the three years ended December 31, 2022, Direct Investment Holdings Group, Inc. (formerly, First Equity Properties, Inc.) did not issue
or sell any securities, nor did DIHG (formerly FEPI) purchase any of its equity securities. The Board of Directors has not authorized
any stock repurchase program.

The

to an increase in general and administrative expenses. 

A
substantial asset concentration relates to a mortgage note receivable from one entity. Any adverse conditions that could affect the financial
condition of this entity and specifically their ability to service debt obligation owed, could have a material effect on the financial
statements of the Company. The entity is currently not in default of their obligations. Management of the Company considers the collectability
of such obligation to not be a question at this time. 

Financial
Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity 

Our
primary source of liquidity is from proceeds from accrued interest on a mortgage note receivable. At December 31, 2022, we had total
assets of 625,763. In 2022, a related party note receivable was fully collected. A mortgage note receivable from a non-related party
was purchased. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of 752,426. 

 Cash
flow analysis 

The following summary discussion of our cash flows are based on the Statements of Cash Flows as presented in this Form 10-K and is not
meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows. 

2022
as compared to 2021 The overall cash flow increased as compared to the year ended 2021 due to receipt of funds from note receivable
by the amount of 700,767. 

Contractual
obligations 

We do not have any further contractual obligations and commitments in regard to payments of operating leases. 

Environmental
Matters 

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations,
the Company may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other potential costs, relating to hazardous
or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property) where any property-level manager in the employee
of a subsidiary of the Company may have arranged for the removal, disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. Management
is not aware of any environmental liability relating to the above matters that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, assets, or results of operations. 

Inflation 
 
The effects of inflation on the Company s operations are not quantifiable. To the extent that inflation affects interest rates,
the Company s earnings from any short-term investments and the cost of new financings as well as the cost of variable rate financing
will be affected .

ITEM
 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which may adversely affect its financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, the Company manages exposures through its regular operating
activities. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged
financial instruments. 

Based upon the Company s market risk sensitive instruments (including variable rate debt) outstanding at December 31, 2022, the
Company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the Company s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows as of such date.

ITEM
 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

A review and evaluation was performed by management under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Rule 13a-15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of December 31, 2022. Based upon that most recent evaluation,
which was completed as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2022 to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time period specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms. As a result
of this evaluation, there were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period
ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
of the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, we conducted
an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The assessment was based
on criteria established in the framework Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2022. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

The
Company has historically engaged in and likely will continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties. Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s length basis due to the absence of premarket forces that naturally
exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business
and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in the best interest of our Company. 

The
Company held a related party note receivable at December 31, 2021 which was received including all accrued interest on April 12,
2022. 

Director
Independence 

Although
the Company is not a listed issuer, the Board of Directors has determined to utilize a definition of independence from the NYSE American
exchange standard. Utilizing that standard, the Board of Directors, which consists of two individuals who are also executive officers
of the Company, Jeffrey Anderson and Glen Gomez and one additional Director, Emilia Linardakis, has determined that only Ms. Linardakis
is independent, utilizing the standards of the NYSE American exchange.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of 

 Direct
Investors Holdings Group, Inc. (Formerly First Equity Properties, Inc.) 

 Plantation,
Florida 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Direct Investors Holdings Group, Inc. (Formerly First Equity Properties, Inc.) (the Company)
as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the related statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes collectively referred to as the financial statements. In
our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCOAB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Transactions
with and Balances Due from Related Parties 

Description
of the Matter - The Company has had significant transactions with and balances due from related parties. The Company performs an
assessment as to whether substantially all related party transactions are properly disclosed and that amounts due from related parties
are probable of collection. 

Auditing
the Company s related party transactions involved subjective judgment of the Company s identification, collectability assessment
and disclosure of related party transactions. The determination involves consideration of the terms of the receivable, whether the receivable
is currently performing, and any security for the receivable. 

How
We addressed the Matter in Our Audit - We obtained an understanding of the Company s controls over related party transactions
and their disclosure. Our testing included, among other things, confirmation of related party transactions, reviewing selected financial
information of the related parties, reviewing collections, and evaluating transaction documentation. The relevant financial statement
accounts are notes receivable and interest income from related parties.
