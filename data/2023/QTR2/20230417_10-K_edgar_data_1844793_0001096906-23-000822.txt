Our menus can be easily tailored to any region without affecting the inventory sourcing and still maintaining the company s original branding. Our goal is to become a fully integrated cafe that includes current and future revenue streams from operations, location sales, royalty, license fees, and distribution sales. To increase YO-Health s market share, the company s vertically balanced integration model will allow the servicing of multiple members of the supply chain which includes, corporate-operated stores, joint venture locations, and retailers under one corporate umbrella. This approach will give the Company tighter control and the ability to streamline the distribution process, increase efficiencies, and reduce costs through economies of scale.

Important factors, uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Risk Factors which may appear in our filings and reports made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), our lack of working capital, the value of our securities, the impact of competition, the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions, technology and 
 6 
 
 technological changes, a potential decrease in consumer spending and the condition of the domestic and global credit and capital markets.

 Overview 
 
 For an overview of the business of the Company, please refer to this Comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K to Part I, Item 1 Business ). 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The report of our independent registered public accounting firms that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, contain a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cash in operations of 1,366,146 during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had working capital deficit of 58,993. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 14,184,721. These matters and our expected needs for capital investments required to support operational growth raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Without additional capital, we will be unable to achieve our business objectives, and may be forced to curtail our operations, reduce headcount, and/or temporarily cease our operations until requisite capital is secured. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s applications of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for our company include accounting for stock-based compensation. 
 
 Stock Based Compensation 
 
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employees, consultants and third parties are required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employees, consultants and third parties services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the years then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation, valuation of intangible assets; estimated useful life assigned to finite-lived assets and impairment of long-lived assets.

Results of Operations 
 
 Net revenue . 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, revenues generated were approximately 4,038,120 and 1,557,375, an increase of 2,480,744 or approximately 159 . Revenues were derived primarily from retail sales of our food products at Company owned facilities. 
 
 Operating expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 11,624,080, compared to 2,687,090 for the same period ended December 31, 2021. Non-cash stock based compensation was 8,292,000 and1,046,250 respectively for the 2022 and 2021 periods. Excluding stock based compensation, operating expenses were 3,332,080 and 1,640,840, respectively for the 2022 and 2021 period. 
 
 Other income(expense) 
 
 Other expense was 46,890 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 15,901 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of higher interest expense as a result of higher levels of mortgages outstanding during the 2022 period. 
 
 Net Loss . As a result of the foregoing we recorded net loss of 10,590,795 0.15 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net loss of 3,143,489 0.06 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is a result of the factors as described above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Since inception we have incurred and continue to incur significant losses from operations. Historically, we have financed our operations through various financings. If we continue to incur negative cash flow from sources of operating activities for longer than expected our ability to continue as a going concern could be in substantial doubt and we will require additional funds through debt facilities, and/or public or private equity or debt financings to continue operations. The Company is working to secure financing to continue to support the Company s businesses and meet all of its financial obligations. The Company can provide no assurance as to the successful conclusion of the financing. Furthermore, the Company is aggressively looking to reduce costs of its operations as well as eliminating certain corporate overhead expenses to maximize income. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain the capital we require on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us. Without additional capital, we will be unable to achieve our business objectives, and may be forced to curtail our operations, reduce headcount, and/or temporarily cease our operations until requisite capital is secured.

 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities were 1,474,378 and 3,073,589 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease is attributable to decreased purchases of property and equipment.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary / Treasurer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary / Treasurer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary / Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This is the Company s first report under the Exchange Act. With the assistance of its CFO Consultant it plans to implement such controls and procedures before the due date of its first 10-Q report. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our Company has not been subject to the filing requirements of the Exchange Act prior to the filing of this report. As a result our management did not conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021and December 31, 2020 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).Without such an evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 
 
 The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the PCAOB were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) lack of disclosure controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Secretary / Treasurer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results.. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside Directors on our Board of Directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. With the assistance of its CFO Consultant it plans to implement such controls and procedures before the due date of its second 10-Q report. 
 9 
 
 This Comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report which was not filed was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021and December 31, 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 To the shareholders and the board of directors of Yo-Health, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Yo-Health, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . The Company expects to generate operating cash flows that will be sufficient to fund presently anticipated operations although there can be no assurance. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company will need to raise additional funds and is currently exploring alternative sources of financing to supplement the expected cash flow. Historically, the Company has raised capital through private placements, as an interim measure to finance working capital needs and may continue to raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or other securities and obtaining some short-term loans. The Company will be required to continue to do so until its revenues support its operations.

 Accounting Principles 
 
 Under ASC 842, the determination of whether an arrangement is a lease is made at the lease s inception and a contract is (or contains) a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is defined under the standard as having both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. Management only reassesses its determination if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our balance sheets. 
 
 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the implicit rate when it is readily determinable. Since most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, to determine the present value of lease payments, management uses the Company s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement. Operating lease ROU assets also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, with renewal options that can extend the lease from three to five years. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. 
 
 The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, for which it has made an accounting policy election to account for these as a single lease component.
