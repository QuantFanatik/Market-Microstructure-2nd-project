PART
I 

Item 1. Business 

We
primarily engage in the manufacturing and distribution of organic fertilizer and the sales of agricultural products in the PRC. Our organic
fertilizer products are sold under our brand names Zongbao, Fukang, and Muliang. Our indirectly
owned subsidiary Viagoo Pte Ltd, a Singapore company, is primarily focused on building smart document, operation and delivery platform
for distribution and logistics companies. 

Through
our patented technology, we are able to process crop straw (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic
nutritious fertilizers that are easily absorbed by crops in three hours. Straw is a common agricultural by-product. In the PRC, farmers
usually remove the straw stubble that remains after harvesting grains by burning them in order to continue farming on the same land season
to season. These activities have resulted in significant air pollution, and damage the surface structure of the soil by causing a loss
of nutrients. We turn waste into treasure by transforming the straws into organic fertilizer, which also effectively reduces air pollution.
The straw-based organic fertilizer we produce does not contain the heavy metals, antibiotics, or harmful bacteria that are common in
traditional manure fertilizer. Our fertilizers also provide optimum levels of primary plant nutrients, including multi-minerals, proteins
and carbohydrates that promotes healthy soil capable of growing excellent crops and vegetables. It effectively reduces the use of chemical
fertilizers and pesticides as well as reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil, thus avoiding
water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve the fertility of soil and the quality and safety of agricultural products. 

We
generated our revenue mainly from our organic fertilizers, which accounted for approximately 91.5 and 95.8 of our total revenue
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We currently have two integrated factories in Weihai City, Shandong
Province, PRC to produce our organic fertilizers, which have been in operations since August 2015. We plan to improve the technology
for our existing organic straw fertilizer production lines in the following aspects: (i) adopt more advanced automatic control technology
for raw material feed to shorten the processing time of raw material, and (ii) manufacture powdered organic fertilizer instead of granular
organic fertilizer in order to avoid the drying and cooling process, as such will increase our production capacity. 

Besides
our focus on producing organic fertilizers, we also engage in the business of selling agriculture food products including apples, and
as a sales agent for other large agriculture companies in the PRC. In 2014, we rented 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land
as an apple orchard. The sales of apples generated less than 1 of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 respectively . We expect to generate more revenues from the sales of apples as the apple orchards become more mature in the
next few years. 

In addition, we began the processing and distribution
of black goat products business in June 2023. We are currently constructing a deep-processing slaughterhouse and processing plant which
is expected to have the capacity of slaughtering 200,000 black goats per year in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, in China. Our black
goat processing products including goat rib lets, goat loin roast, goat loin chops, goat rack, goat leg, goat shoulder, goat leg shanks,
ground goat, goat stew meat, whole goat, half goat, lamb viscera, etc. We expect to start generating revenue from the black goat products
in 2023. 

Our
42,895 square meters of industrial land and 28,549 square meters of factory and office space located in Jinshan District, Shanghai was
sold for RMB 74.52 million (US 11.42 million), and the transaction has been settled as of December 31, 2021..Our assets mainly include:
(i) 22,511 square meters of industrial land and 10,373 square meters of plant area and organic straw fertilizer production line in Weihai
City, Shandong Province, and (ii) over 2 million investment of land use right and the black goat slaughtering and processing plant located
in Shuangbai County, Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, in China.

liability company, owned 95 by Lirong Wang and 5 by Zongfang Wang. Muliang Industry through its own operations and its subsidiaries
is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling organic fertilizers for use in the agricultural industry. 

On
May 27, 2013, Muliang Industry entered into and consummated an equity purchase agreement whereby it acquired 99 of the outstanding equity
of Weihai Fukang Bio-Fertilizer Co., Ltd. Fukang ), a corporation organized under the laws of the People s Republic
of China. Fukang was incorporated in Weihai City, Shandong Province on January 6, 2009. Fukang is focused on the distribution of organic
fertilizers and the development of new bio-organic fertilizers. As a result of the completion of the transaction, Fukang became a 99 
owned subsidiary of Muliang Industry, with the remaining 1 equity interest owned by Mr. Hui Song. 

On
July 11, 2013, Muliang Industry established a wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Muliang Development Co., Ltd. Agritech Development in Shanghai, China. On November 6, 2013, Muliang Industry sold 40 of the outstanding equity of Agritech Development to Mr. Jianping
Zhang for consideration of approximately 65,000 or RMB 400,000. Agritech Development does not currently conduct any operations. 

On

Environmental Construction Co., Ltd. Shanghai Zongbao with consideration of approximately 3.2 million or RMB 20 million,
effectively becoming the wholly-owned subsidiary of Muliang Industry. Shanghai Zongbao was incorporated in Shanghai on January 25, 2008.
Shanghai Zongbao processes and distributes organic fertilizers. Shanghai Zongbao wholly owns Shanghai Zongbao Environmental Construction
Co., Ltd. Cangzhou Branch Zongbao Cangzhou ). 

On
August 21, 2014, Muliang Agricultural Limited Muliang HK was incorporated in Hong Kong as an investment holding company. 

January
27, 2015, Muliang HK incorporated a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, Shanghai Mufeng Investment Consulting Co., Ltd Shanghai
Mufeng ), in China 

2 

On July 8, 2015, Mullan Agritech entered into
certain stock purchase agreement with Muliang Agriculture, Inc., pursuant to which Mullan Agritech, for a consideration of 5,000, acquired
100 interest in Muliang HK and its wholly-owned subsidiary Shanghai Mufeng. Both Muliang HK and Shanghai Mufeng are controlled by the
Company s officer and director, Lirong Wang. 

On July 23, 2015, Muliang Industry established
a wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Muliang Agricultural Sales Co., Ltd. Muliang Sales in Shanghai, China. 

On September 3, 2015, Mullan Agritech effected
a split of its outstanding common stock resulting in an aggregate of 75,262,500 shares outstanding of which 60,000,000 were owned by Chenxi
Shi, the founder of Mullan Agritech and its then sole officer and director. The remaining 15,262,500 were held by a total of 39 investors. 

On January 11, 2016, Mullan Agritech issued 64,737,500
shares of its common stock to Lirong Wang for an aggregate consideration of 64,737.50. On the same date, Chenxi Shi, the then sole officer
and director of Mullan Agritech on that date, transferred 60,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by him to Lirong Wang
for 800 pursuant to a transfer agreement. 

On
February 10, 2016, Shanghai Mufeng entered into a set of contractual agreements known as Variable Interest Entity VIE Agreements, including (1) Exclusive Technical Consulting and Service Agreement, (2) Equity Pledge Agreement, and (3) Call Option Cooperation
Agreement, with Muliang Industry, and its Principal Shareholders. As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the set of VIE Agreements,
Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd., along with its consolidated subsidiaries, became entities controlled by Mullan Agritech, whereby
Mullan Agritech would derive all substantial economic benefit generated by Muliang Industry and its subsidiaries. 

As
a result, Mullan Agritech has a direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Muliang HK and an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary Shanghai Mufeng.
Through its VIE Agreements, Mullan Agritech exercises control over Muliang Industry. Muliang Industry has two wholly-owned subsidiaries
(Shanghai Zongbao and Muliang Sales), one 99 owned subsidiary (Fukang), one 60 owned subsidiary (Agritech Development), and one indirectly
wholly owned subsidiary Zongbao Cangzhou.

Development Investment Co., Ltd. owns the other 45 shares. Yunnan Muliang was setup for the sales development of West China. 

On
October 12, 2017, the Company canceled the registration of Ningling with the administration authorities for Industry and Commerce. Ningling
has historically been reported as a component of our operations and incurred 33,323 to loss before income taxes provisions for the year
ended December 31, 2017. The termination does not constitute a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial
results and as such, the termination is not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. 

3 

On February 22, 2016 and June 8, 2017, Muliang
Industry established a 65 owned subsidiary of Maguan Jiamu Agricultural Development Co., Ltd (Maguan), and a 100 owned subsidiary of

Our
Industry 

The
Status and Market Demand of the Organic Straw Fertilizer Industry in China 

In
China, straw exists in a large quantity and has a wide variety of uses and broad distribution. The annual output of straw is more than
700 million tons, according to the China Industry Information Network s report on 2017 China Straw Resource Reserves and
Utilization Market Overview. Straw contains more than 3 million tons of nitrogen, more than 700,000 tons of phosphorus and nearly
7 million tons of potassium; this is equivalent to more than a quarter of the amount of fertilizer China s currently uses and equivalent
to 300 million tons of standard coal. Unfortunately, nearly 100 million tons of straw chaff are burned directly in the fields every year,
which not only seriously damages the beneficial bacteria in the soil surface but directly leads to severe air pollution and increases
the greenhouse effect. With such a significant amount of straw production in China, if even a part of the straw can be recycled each
year, it will bring huge, sustainable recycling resources to the fertilizer industry. On November 25, 2015, the National Development
and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environmental Protection jointly issued
a notice, requiring the utilization rate of straw to exceed 85 by 2020. 

The
market demand in China for organic fertilizer is significant. According to the National Bureau of Statistics in 2019, the China national
sales volume of organic fertilizers in 2018 was 133.42 million tons. According to the current policy of encouraging less use of chemical
fertilizer, improving the quality of agricultural products and restoring land, it is estimated that the demand of organic fertilizers
will increase to 180 million tons by 2020. At the same time, according to a governmental advocate of increasing proportion of organic
fertilizer to 50 of the total use of fertilizer, the demand in China for organic fertilizer will reach more than 500 million tons by
2030. 

The
Environmental Benefits of Promoting Organic Straw Fertilizer 

Lower
Air Pollution- If each county area builds straw disposal factories that can handle even 100,000 tons of waste, 100 counties can offset
the damage from destructive burning equivalent to approximately 10 million tons of straw. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions
by 15 million tons and reduce a huge amount of carbon monoxide, volatile organic particles (PM), nitrogen oxides, benzene, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and other harmful gases released into the atmosphere. 

Lower
soil pollution and greater environment restoration- Straw is a circulating agricultural resource and the best organic fertilizer
resource, according to Baidu. Organic straw fertilizer is also the main agricultural tool used to convert wasteland, tidal flats, and
saline-alkali land into arable land. It is also the primary tool in transforming barren land into medium-low yield fields and to upgrade
medium-low yield fields to high-quality fertile fields. 

Lower
water pollution- The utilization rate of traditional chemical fertilizers is generally below 30 , and 70 of dissolved chemical fertilizers
directly enter underground water bodies and flow into rivers, resulting in eutrophication of water bodies. Increasing the application
of organic fertilizer is one of the important methods to reduce water pollution. 

The
High Growth of Logistics and Last Mile Delivery Market in China 

According
to research done by Reportlinker.com (https://www.reportlinker.com/p05819554/Global-Last-Mile-Delivery-Industry.html?utm_source=GNW),
the global last mile delivery market is estimated to reach USD 53.4 billion by 2027. China, the world s second largest economy
is expected to reach a market size of USD 9.3 billion by the year 2027, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1 over
the analysis period of 2020 to 2027. 

With
Muliang Viagoo s last mile delivery platform, we are in a good position to aggregate the carriers and merchant s orders by
taking advantage of route optimization and tracking technologies to drive down the cost per delivery. The platform has the ability to
expand beyond Muliang s business network of organic fertilizer supplies to food distribution, restaurants, and eCommerce merchants.

Our
Products 

We are committed to ensuring the quality of our
agricultural products. We aim to provide high-quality and environmentally friendly organic straw fertilizer for our customers. Our organic
fertilizers are the products of natural decomposition and are easy for plants to absorb and digest. Our powder form fertilizer maximizes
the survival rate of microorganisms, ensures faster nutrient absorption, and increases soil improvement seed and processing productivity.
While we are primarily engaged in producing organic fertilizers, we also sell agriculture food products such as apples. We generated our
revenue mainly from our organic fertilizers, which constituted approximately 93.2 and 91.5 of our total revenue for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The sales of apples generated less than 1 of our total revenue for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, we invested in the construction of a deep-processing slaughterhouse
which is expected to have the capacity of slaughtering 200,000 black goats per year in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, China. We expect
to complete the construction in June 2023 and start generating revenues from the black goat processing products in the third quarter of
2023. 

Organic
Fertilizer 

Our
fertilizer products are sold under our brand names Zongbao, Fukang, and Muliang. There are
seven lines of our organic fertilizers including: 

Soil
improvement and preparation fertilizer, which includes compound microbes, probiotics that can supplement microorganisms and trace elements
of soil. It can be used as both starter fertilizer and regular fertilizer; 

Root
protection fertilizer, which is an organic nutrient water-soluble fertilizer that can help the growth of crops roots; 

Foliar
nutrition fertilizer, which is a biological growth promoter to help customers take care of the foliar of their plants; 

Lower
pesticide residue fertilizer, which can help our customers reduce the usage of pesticide and enhance the resistance ability for plants; 

Fruit
special fertilizer which contains enhanced nutrient availability to increase plant performance; 

Fruit
tree fertilizer that promotes healthy roots and fruit growth and are ideal for all fruit trees and berries; and 

Corn
and peanuts fertilizer that are specially used for corns and peanuts. 

Our
organic fertilizer contains all-purpose nutrition that can be used in the different stages of plant growth. It aims to increase soil
fertility, improve soil aggregate structure, provide nutrient absorption ability for crop, improve water retention capacity and improve
fertilizer utilization, thus creating a sustainable environment and healthy soil. 

Apple
Orchard 

In
2014, we leased 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land as an apple farm and, for the purpose of using our own fertilizer to demonstrate
the advantages of our organic straw fertilizer. The selling of apples generated less than 1 of our total revenue for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As the apple trees become more mature, we expect to generate more revenues from the sales
of apples in the future. 

Future
Products 

Black
Goat Processing Products 

Currently we invested in a goat slaughtering
and processing factory located in Shuangbai County, Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, PRC starting in 2018. This factory is expected to
be completed in June 2023 with a capacity of deep processing of 200,000 black goats per year. Our products will include goat riblets,
goat loin roast, goat loin chops, goat rack, goat leg, goat shoulder, goat leg shanks, ground goat, goat stew meat, whole goat, half
goat, and lamb viscera, etc. We expect to commence sales of black goat processing products and start generating revenue in the third
quarter of 2023. 

Forage
Grass 

We
are exploring the options to use forage grass as an alternative for traditional feed for live-stocks. We currently have several research
and development projects with schools and institutions. See Research and Development below.

Our
Technology and Manufacturing Process 

We
utilize our patented technologies to process crop straws into organic fertilizer. 

Crop
straws include the stems, roots, leaves, pods and vines of crops. The main ingredients are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, as well
as a small amount of minerals. Straw is a crude fiber material that is waxy and lignified. The fermentation cycle is long for the straw
to be processed into organic fertilizer, as it takes 15 days to 60 days for microbial action. This is a common challenge for the large-scale
and timely manufacturing of straw fertilizer. 

The
crop straws will be processed into a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer in a closed container by low-pressure, medium-temperature acid
hydrolysis technology (with 9-to-13-kg pressure and at 150-to-180-degree temperature). The basic principle is as follows: 

We
utilize cellulose hydrolysis, hemicellulose hydrolysis and lignin hydrolysis methods to process cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin into
short-chain cellulose, polysaccharide, monosaccharide, oligomer, etc. Based on the demand for our organic fertilizers and the controlled
processing conditions, on average our methods produce a mix with a majority of short-chain cellulose, some polysaccharides and a small
amount of monosaccharides. 

The
straws are stored in our warehouse after compacting them in a briquetting machine. The straw compacts are easy to transfer and occupy
less storage space. The straw compacts will be first crushed to 3 cm to 5 cm in length. The straws are then processed in the hydrothermal
degradation tank for 2 to 3 hours. We pump steam generated by a boiler into the hydrothermal degradation tank, so that the temperature
in the hydrothermal degradation tank is maintained between 150 C and 180 C and the pressure is maintained at 0.9-1.3MPa. After
2-3 hours of thermal degradation, we release the pressure to 0.2~0.4MPa. By releasing the pressure, the straws explode to the storage
tank, resulting in a mechanical treatment of the explosion impinging stream, breaking the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the
straw, breaking the hydrogen bonds, degrading fiber crystallization regions into an amorphous stage and degrading macromolecules into
micro-molecules. After that, we add different auxiliary materials through an automatic batching system to make different organic fertilizers
suitable for different crops. We then repeat a process of crushing, granulating, cooling and screening before packaging the fertilizers
into products.

Our
Growth Strategy 

We
intend to build upon our proven ability to produce high-quality organic fertilizer and increase our presence and market share in the
agriculture industry. We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below and expect to continue to do so over the several
years following this offering. Although the net proceeds of this offering will be available to assist us to implement our growth strategies,
we cannot estimate the ultimate amount of capital needed to achieve our expected growth. We may need additional capital to implement
these strategies, particularly in the event we pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies. 

Scale
Up Production of Organic Fertilizer and Accelerate Penetration in Local and Regional Markets 

We plan to construct a new organic fertilizer
factory in Heilongjiang Province, China. We have entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Suihua City of Heilongjiang Province
to produce a total of 1 million tons of organic fertilizer. We expect to produce 107,000 tons of organic fertilizer in 2023 and the remaining
within the next 10 years. In addition, we will establish warehouse and distribution center in Heilongjiang Province, which is expected
to accelerate penetration in the local and regional market. 

Increase
Sources of Revenue by Expanding Our Current Business 

We have a slaughtering and processing plant for
black goats under construction in Yunnan Province, China. We expect the plant to begin operations in June 2023 and start generating revenue
in the third quarter of 2023. Demand for lamb in China as an alternative to pork is increasing due to growing concern on swine disease
and pork quality. We plan to offer lamb and lamb products to consumers via a subscription program available on our website and mobile
app in the future.

Continue
to Invest in Research and Development and Expand Our Product Portfolio 

We have invested significant capital in the development
and improvement of our products. One of the R D results introduced us to a type of forage grass that contains 30 more protein than
other crops. We plan to work with the forage grass farmers in Xinjiang Province and to produce plant protein powder from the forage grass
to be used in food and beverages in 2023. 

Growth
Strategy in Viagoo Online Smart Logistics 

The
Chinese smart logistics industry reached a total size of USD 37 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach a size of USD 135 billion by
the year 2024. (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190903005657/en/China-Smart-Logistics-Market-Report-2019-Industry) 

As
of 2018, there were 25.68 million registered trucks in China based on data shown in Statista.com. To ride on the growth trend and capitalize
the emerging growth potential, Muliang Viagoo will be implementing the Viagoo Technology platform in China and targeting the China fleet
owners and truck drivers. 

The
Viagoo VTM is a very apt and synergistic logistic platform for the Chinese logistic market as it has huge geographical distance and a
huge population of truck drivers. They can collaborate by job listings/postings, sub listings and job bookings in a resource sharing
model. Muliang Viagoo can potentially extend to seek further value-added revenue streams deriving, for example, from insurance and soliciting
job bookings. 

Mitigating
empty return trips for truck drivers and fleet operators is a key reason to join and onboard our VTM platform as it leads to cost reductions
and added revenue. The onboarding of retailers, malls, and ecommerce (shippers) who are the source of demand generation in tandem with
truck drivers and fleet owners (the carriers) are the fulfilment of demand, hence forming a sought-after business equilibrium. 

With
Muliang Viagoo s connections to farms, malls, logistics service providers in conjunction with VTM platform, we are well poised
to pave way to gain quicker inroads into China logistic markets to seek business growth as planned. 

As
for South East Asia, third party logistics market accounted for US 36.4 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5 over
the forecast period 2018-2025, to account for US 55.7 billion in 2025. Viagoo platform is well positioned in the regional technology
hub of ASEAN and we are targeting to have a strong growth in these markets. 

In
China, we plan to adopt a three phases approach. In phase 1, the platform will be opened to Muliang s businesses and business partners.
The platform will enable participating merchants to take advantage of Viagoo s digital technology to improve efficiency and lower
costs. We plan to onboard truck drivers to the platform to list their services. To entice the drivers to join, we plan to partner with
local insurance and finance companies to offer discounts in insurance coverage and truck leasing. 

In
phase 2, we plan to use data analytics technology to provide forecasts on supply and demand across provinces and delivery locations.
With the improved data, the platform services is expected to expand the market coverage to other cities and provinces. We plan to deploy
blockchain technology to enhance data and transaction security. Using a distributed ledger, the data is protected and transparent between
the respective stakeholders. 

In
phase 3, we plan to expand the partner network to include other supportive merchants to offer their services at the key rest stops across
the strategic locations. 

Outside
China, we plan to work with joint venture partners in target countries to establish our platform services. This is to ensure a quick
deployment of the services and reduce the political and cultural differences. The target countries include Malaysia, Hong Kong SAR, and
Indonesia. 

We
also plan to look at introducing specialized services such as medicine delivery linking to hospital and clinical systems for on demand
dispensing.

The
 validity of utility model patent is ten years. It was noticed that five of the utility model
 patents owned by the Company were expired in April 2019 and were not extendable. The Company
 has noticed the situation and is planning to submit patent applications in another country
 to protect their intellectual property. 

 However,
 the expired patents has little impact on the company. And the Company also improved some
 patents although there is no further successful patent extension so far.

Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act 

U.S.
laws and regulations, including the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, may restrict or eliminate our ability to complete
a business combination with certain companies, particularly those acquisition candidates with substantial operations in China. 

On
March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements
of the Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act, or the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the
SEC identifies it as having a non-inspection year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. In June 2021,
the Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would reduce the time period
for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two consecutive years instead of three years. If our auditor cannot be inspected
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of our securities on any U.S.
national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB
adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under
the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction
because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize
rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA, which became effective on January 10, 2022. The rules apply
to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting
firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken
by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to
inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in Mainland China and in Hong Kong, because
of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made its determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides
a framework for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCA Act. The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix
B, Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the
Hong Kong Determination, respectively. 

On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a SOP with the CSRC and the MOF of the PRC regarding cooperation in the oversight of PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong which establishes a method for the PCAOB to conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong, as contemplated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the agreement, (a) the PCAOB
has sole discretion to select the firms, audit engagements and potential violations it inspects and investigates without consultation
with, or input from, PRC authorities; (b) procedures are in place for PCAOB inspectors and investigators to view complete audit work
papers with all information included and for the PCAOB to retain information as needed; (c) the PCAOB has direct access to interview
and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB inspects or investigates; and (d) the PCAOB shall have the
unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the SEC can use the information
for all regulatory purposes, including administrative or civil enforcement actions. The PCAOB was required to reassess its determinations
as to whether it is able to carry out inspections and investigations completely and without obstruction by the end of 2022. On December
15, 2022, the PCAOB determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and vacated its previous determinations. However, should PRC authorities obstruct
or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination. 

Congress
passed fiscal year 2023 Omnibus spending legislation in December 2022, which contained provisions to accelerate the HFCAA timeline for
implementation of trading prohibitions from three years to two years. As a result, the SEC is required to prohibit an issuer s
securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections or complete investigations for
two consecutive years. 

Our
auditor, WWC, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this prospectus,
is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable
professional standards with the last inspection in November 2021, and as of the date of this prospectus, our auditor is not subject to
the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021.
However, as more stringent criteria have been imposed by the SEC and the PCAOB recently, which would add uncertainties to our offering,
and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering
the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency
of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements. In the event it is later determined
that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company s auditor because of a position taken by an authority
in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in the Company s securities to be prohibited under
the HFCAA, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist the Company s securities. 

The
recent developments would add uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply
additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality
control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to
the audit of our financial statements.

Transfers
of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries 

Muliang
is a holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiary and VIE in China.
As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, Muliang s ability to pay
dividends to its shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries and license
and service fees paid by our PRC consolidated affiliated entities. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own in the future, the
instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to Muliang. In addition, our PRC subsidiary and VIE are required
to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a liquidation
of the companies. 

Current
PRC regulations permit our indirect PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Shanghai Mufeng only out of their accumulated profits, if any,
determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required
to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50 of its
registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the
employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although
the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained
earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. 

The
PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC.
Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency
for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future,
the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are
unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through the current VIE Agreements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our
common stock. 

Cash
dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes,
any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding
tax at a rate of up to 10.0 . 

In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders,
we will be dependent on payments made from Shanghai Muliang to Shanghai Mufeng, pursuant to VIE Agreements between them, and the distribution
of such payments to Muliang HK as dividends from Shanghai Mufeng. Certain payments from Shanghai Muliang to Shanghai Mufeng are subject
to PRC taxes, including business taxes and VAT. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Shanghai Muliang made no payments to
Shanghai Mufeng. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was no cash transferred between the Company and Shanghai Muliang
(our VIEs). 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
none of the VIE and its subsidiaries have issued any dividends or distributions to respective holding companies, or to any investors as
of the date of this prospectus. Our subsidiaries in the PRC generate and retain cash generated from operating activities and re-invest
it in our business. 

Muliang
is permitted under the laws of the state of Nevada to provide funding to Muliang HK through loans or capital contributions without restrictions
on the amount of the funds. Muliang HK is permitted under the respective laws of Hong Kong to provide funding to Shanghai Mufeng through
dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. 

To
transfer cash from Muliang HK to Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang HK can increase its registered capital in WFOE, which requires a filing with
the local commerce department, or through a shareholder loan, which requires a filing with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
or its local bureau. Aside from the declaration to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, there is no restriction or limitations
on such cash transfer or earnings distribution. 

To
transfer cash from Shanghai Mufeng to Shanghai Muliang, Shanghai Mufeng can increase its registered capital in Shanghai Muliang, which
requires a filing with the local commerce department, or through a shareholder loan to Shanghai Muliang, which requires a filing with
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local bureau. Aside from the declaration to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange,
there is no restriction or limitations on such cash transfer or earnings distribution. However, our PRC subsidiaries may not procure
loans which exceed the difference between their respective registered capital and total investment amount as recorded in the Foreign
Investment Comprehensive Management Information System. 

To
make loans to Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng or Shanghai Muliang, according to Matters relating to the Macro-prudential Management of Comprehensive
Cross-border Financing, or PBOC Circular 9 promulgated by the People s Bank of China, the total cross-border financing of a company
shall be calculated using a risk-weighted approach and shall not exceed an upper limit. The upper limit shall be calculated as capital
or assets (for enterprises, net assets shall apply) multiplied by a cross-border financing leverage ratio and multiplied by a macro-prudential
regulation parameter. The macro-prudential regulation parameter is currently 1, which may be adjusted by the People s Bank of China
and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in the future, and the cross-border financing leverage ratio is 2 for enterprises. Therefore,
the upper limit of the loans that a PRC company can borrow from foreign companies shall be calculated at 2 times the borrower s
net assets. When Shanghai Mufeng and Shanghai Muliang jointly apply for borrowing foreign debt, the upper limit of borrowing shall be
2 times of the net assets in the consolidated financial statement, and Shanghai Muliang shall make a commitment to refrain from borrowing
foreign debt in their own respective names. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
Muliang and its subsidiaries have not distributed any earnings or settled any amounts owed under the previous VIE Agreements. nor does
Muliang and its subsidiaries have any plan to distribute earnings or settle amounts in the foreseeable future.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Risks
Relating to Doing Business in the PRC 

If
the PRC government deems that any of our contractual arrangements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment
in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject
to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. 

Foreign
ownership of internet-based businesses, such as distribution of online information, is subject to restrictions under current PRC laws
and regulations. For example, foreign investors are not allowed to own more than 50 of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication
service provider (except e-commerce) and any such foreign investor must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services
overseas and maintain a good track record in accordance with the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment promulgated in
2007, as amended in 2011 and in 2015, respectively, and other applicable laws and regulations. 

Muliang
Viagoo is a holding company incorporated in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial
majority of our operations in the People s Republic of China, or PRC or China, though our variable
interest entity, Shanghai Muliang and its subsidiaries. We receive the economic benefits of the VIE s business operations through
certain contractual arrangements. Investors in our common shares offered in this offering are purchasing shares of the U.S. holding company
and not shares of the VIE and its subsidiaries in China that are conducting the business operations. 

It
is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted,
what they would provide. In particular, in January 2015, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOC, published a discussion draft of the proposed
Foreign Investment Law for public review and comments. Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of
foreign investment and introduces the principle of actual control in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested
enterprise, or an FIE. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately
 controlled by foreign investors, and would be subject to restrictions on foreign investments. However, the draft law has
not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing companies with the variable interest entity 
structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties. It is uncertain when the draft will be signed into law and
whether the final version will have any substantial changes from the draft. Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment
timetable, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate
structure, corporate governance and business operations below. If the ownership structure, contractual arrangements and business
of our company are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or we fail to obtain or maintain any of
the required permits or approvals, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation,
including levying fines, confiscating our income, shutting down our servers, discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions
on our operations, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from
this offering to finance our business and operations in China and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful
to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and could severely damage our reputation,
which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

PRC
regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC-resident beneficial owners or our PRC
subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or limit our PRC subsidiaries 
ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits. 

In
July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore
Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which replaces the previous
SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents, including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities, to register with SAFE
or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our
shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we may make in the future. 

16 

Under
SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments
in offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, are required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition,
any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its registration with the local branch of SAFE
with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident
shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE to reflect any material change. If any PRC resident shareholder
of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited
from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also
be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiaries in China. In February 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice
on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. Under SAFE Notice
13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound direct investments, including those
required under SAFE Circular 37, must be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. Qualified banks should examine the applications
and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE. We have used our best efforts to notify PRC residents or entities who directly
or indirectly hold shares in our holding company and who are known to us as being PRC residents to complete the foreign exchange registrations.
However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company,
nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. We cannot assure you that all other shareholders
or beneficial owners of ours who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make, obtain or update any
applicable registrations or approvals required by SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with
SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or
legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to make distributions
or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

Furthermore,
as these foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and implementation
has been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments
and transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject
to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and
foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure
you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations.
In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case
may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange
regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

As
a holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may transfer funds to our Affiliate Entities or finance our operating entity by means of
loans or capital contributions. Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to our Company s PRC subsidiaries,
including from the proceeds of this offering, are subject to the above PRC regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals or make such registration, our ability to
make equity contributions or provide loans to our Company s PRC subsidiaries or to fund their operations may be negatively affected,
which may adversely affect their liquidity and ability to fund their working capital and expansion projects and meet their obligations
and commitments. As a result, our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business may be negatively affected. 

We
must remit the offering proceeds to China before they may be used to benefit our business in China, and this process may take several
months to complete. 

The
process for sending the proceeds from this offering back to China may take as long as six months after the closing of this offering.
In utilizing the proceeds of this offering in the manner described in Use of Proceeds, as an offshore holding company of
our PRC operating subsidiaries, we may make loans to our Affiliated Entities, or we may make additional capital contributions to our
Affiliate Entities. Any loans to our Affiliated Entities are subject to PRC regulations. For example, loans by us to our subsidiaries
in China, which are foreign-invested enterprises, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with
SAFE. 

17 

To
remit the proceeds of the offering, we must take the following steps: 

First,
we will open a special foreign exchange account for capital account transactions. To open this account, we must submit to SAFE certain
application forms, identity documents, transaction documents, form of foreign exchange registration of overseas investments of the domestic
residents, and foreign exchange registration certificate of the invested company. As of the date of this prospectus, we have already
opened a special foreign exchange account for capital account transactions. 

Second,
we will remit the offering proceeds into this special foreign exchange account. 

Third,
we will apply for settlement of the foreign exchange. In order to do so, we must submit to SAFE certain application forms, identity documents,
payment order to a designated person, and a tax certificate. 

The
timing of the process is difficult to estimate because the efficiencies of different SAFE branches can vary significantly. Ordinarily
the process takes several months but is required by law to be accomplished within 180 days of application. 

We
may also decide to finance our subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by MOFCOM
or its local counterpart. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government approvals on a timely basis, if at all,
with respect to future capital contributions by us to our subsidiaries. If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to use the
proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity
and our ability to fund and expand our business. If we fail to receive such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering
and to capitalize our Chinese operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund
and expand our business. 

Changes
in the policies of the PRC government could have a significant impact upon our ability to operate profitably in the PRC. 

We
conduct all of our operations and all of our revenue is generated in the PRC. Accordingly, economic, political and legal developments
in the PRC will significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Policies of the PRC government
can have significant effects on economic conditions in the PRC and the ability of businesses to operate profitably. Our ability to operate
profitably in the PRC may be adversely affected by changes in policies by the PRC government, including changes in laws, regulations
or their interpretation, particularly those dealing with the Internet, including censorship and other restriction on material which can
be transmitted over the Internet, security, intellectual property, money laundering, taxation and other laws that affect our ability
to operate our website. 

Because
our business is dependent upon government policies that encourage a market-based economy, change in the political or economic climate
in the PRC may impair our ability to operate profitably, if at all. 

Although
the PRC government has been pursuing a number of economic reform policies for more than two decades, the PRC government continues to
exercise significant control over economic growth in the PRC. Because of the nature of our business, we are dependent upon the PRC government
pursuing policies that encourage private ownership of businesses. Restrictions on private ownership of businesses would affect the securities
business in general and businesses using real estate service in particular. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will pursue
policies favoring a market-oriented economy or that existing policies will not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a
change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other circumstances affecting political, economic and social life in the PRC. 

18 

PRC
laws and regulations governing our current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain and any changes in such laws and regulations
may impair our ability to operate profitable. 

There
are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to,
the laws and regulations governing our business and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances.
The laws and regulations are sometimes vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement
may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness and interpretation of newly enacted laws or regulations, including amendments
to existing laws and regulations, may be delayed, and our business may be affected if we rely on laws and regulations which are subsequently
adopted or interpreted in a manner different from our understanding of these laws and regulations. New laws and regulations that affect
existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing
or new PRC laws or regulations may have on our business. 

There
are uncertainties under the PRC laws relating to the procedures for U.S. regulators to investigate and collect evidence from companies
located in the PRC. 

According
to Article 177 of the newly amended PRC Securities Law which became effective in March 2020 (the Article 177 ), the securities
regulatory authority of the PRC State Council may collaborate with securities regulatory authorities of other countries or regions in
order to monitor and oversee cross border securities activities. Article 177 further provides that overseas securities regulatory authorities
are not allowed to carry out investigation and evidence collection directly within the territory of the PRC, and that any Chinese entities
and individuals are not allowed to provide documents or materials related to securities business activities to overseas agencies without
prior consent of the securities regulatory authority of the PRC State Council and the competent departments of the PRC State Council. 

Our
PRC counsel has advised us of their understanding that (i) the Article 177 is applicable in the limited circumstances related to direct
investigation or evidence collection conducted by overseas authorities within the territory of the PRC (in such case, the foregoing activities
are required to be conducted through collaboration with or by obtaining prior consent of competent Chinese authorities); (ii) the Article
177 does not limit or prohibit the Company, as a company duly incorporated in Nevada and to be listed on Nasdaq, from providing the required
documents or information to Nasdaq or the SEC pursuant to applicable Listing Rules and U.S. securities laws; and (iii) as the Article
177 is relatively new and there is no implementing rules or regulations which have been published regarding application of the Article
177, it remains unclear how the law will be interpreted, implemented or applied by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission or other
relevant government authorities. As of the date hereof, we are not aware of any implementing rules or regulations which have been published
regarding application of Article 177. However, we cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the securities regulatory
authority of the PRC State Council, would reach the same conclusion as we do. As such, there are uncertainties as to the procedures and
time requirement for the U.S. regulators to bring about investigations and evidence collection within the territory of the PRC. 

Our
principal business operation is conducted in the PRC. In the event that the U.S. regulators carry out investigation on us and there is
a need to conduct investigation or collect evidence within the territory of the PRC, the U.S. regulators may not be able to carry out
such investigation or evidence collection directly in the PRC under the PRC laws. The U.S. regulators may consider cross-border cooperation
with securities regulatory authority of the PRC by way of judicial assistance, diplomatic channels or regulatory cooperation mechanism
established with the securities regulatory authority of the PRC. 

19 

Because
our business is conducted in RMB and the price of our shares of common stock is quoted in United States dollars, changes in currency
conversion rates may affect the value of your investments. 

Our
business is conducted in the PRC, our books and records are maintained in RMB, which is the currency of the PRC, and the financial statements
that we file with the SEC and provide to our shareholders are presented in United States dollars. Changes in the exchange rate between
the RMB and dollar affect the value of our assets and the results of our operations in United States dollars. The value of the RMB against
the United States dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC s political
and economic conditions and perceived changes in the economy of the PRC and the United States. Any significant revaluation of the RMB
may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and financial condition. Further, our shares offered by this prospectus are
offered in United States dollars, and we will need to convert the net proceeds we receive into RMB in order to use the funds for our
business. Changes in the conversion rate between the United States dollar and the RMB will affect that amount of proceeds we will have
available for our business. 

Under
the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, we may be classified as a resident enterprise of China, which could
result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders. 

The
EIT Law and its implementing rules provide that enterprises established outside of China whose de facto management bodies 
are located in China are considered resident enterprises under PRC tax laws. The implementing rules promulgated under the
EIT Law define the term de facto management bodies as a management body which substantially manages, or has control over
the business, personnel, finance and assets of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, issued a circular,
known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management bodies of
a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. However, there are no further detailed rules or precedents
governing the procedures and specific criteria for determining de facto management body. Although our board of directors
and management are located in the PRC, it is unclear if the PRC tax authorities would determine that we should be classified as a PRC
 resident enterprise. 

If
we are deemed as a PRC resident enterprise, we will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on our worldwide income at
a uniform tax rate of 25 , although dividends distributed to us from our existing PRC subsidiary and any other PRC subsidiaries which
we may establish from time to time could be exempt from the PRC dividend withholding tax due to our PRC resident recipient 
status. This could have a material and adverse effect on our overall effective tax rate, our income tax expenses and our net income.
Furthermore, dividends, if any, paid to our shareholders may be decreased as a result of the decrease in distributable profits. In addition,
if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise , any dividends we pay to our non-PRC investors and the gains realized from
the transfer of our shares of common stock may be considered income derived from sources within the PRC and be subject to PRC tax, at
a rate of 10 in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20 in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of
any applicable tax treaty). It is unclear whether holders of our shares of common stock would be able to claim the benefits of any tax
treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. This could
have a material and adverse effect on the value of your investment in us and on the price of our shares of common stock. 

There
are significant uncertainties under the EIT Law relating to the withholding tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary, and dividends payable
by our PRC subsidiary to our offshore subsidiaries may not qualify to enjoy certain treaty benefits. 

Under
the PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules, the profits of a foreign invested enterprise generated through operations, which are distributed
to its immediate holding company outside the PRC, will be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10 . Pursuant to a special arrangement
between Hong Kong and the PRC, such rate may be reduced to 5 if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25 of the equity interest
in the PRC company. Our PRC subsidiary is wholly-owned by our Hong Kong subsidiary. Moreover, under the Notice of the State Administration
of Taxation on Issues regarding the Administration of the Dividend Provision in Tax Treaties promulgated on February 20, 2009, the tax
payer needs to satisfy certain conditions to enjoy the benefits under a tax treaty. These beneficial owner of the relevant dividends,
and (2) the corporate shareholder to receive dividends from the PRC subsidiary must have continuously met the direct ownership thresholds
during the 12 consecutive months preceding the receipt of the dividends. Further, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the
Notice on How to Understand and Recognize the Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties on October 27, 2009, which limits the beneficial
owner to individuals, projects or other organizations normally engaged in substantive operations, and sets forth certain detailed
factors in determining the beneficial owner status. In current practice, a Hong Kong enterprise must obtain a tax resident
certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5 lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority
will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident
certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not commenced the application process
for a Hong Kong tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority, and there is no assurance that we will be granted
such a Hong Kong tax resident certificate. 

Even
after we obtain the Hong Kong tax resident certificate, we are required by applicable tax laws and regulations to file required forms
and materials with relevant PRC tax authorities to prove that we can enjoy 5 lower PRC withholding tax rate. We intend to obtain the
required materials and file with the relevant tax authorities when it plans to declare and pay dividends, but there is no assurance that
the PRC tax authorities will approve the 5 withholding tax rate. 

20 

U.S.
regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China. 

Any
disclosure of documents or information located in China by foreign agencies may be subject to jurisdiction constraints and must comply
with China s state secrecy laws, which broadly define the scope of state secrets to include matters involving economic
interests and technologies. There is no guarantee that requests from U.S. federal or state regulators or agencies to investigate or inspect
our operations will be honored by us, by entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, without violating PRC legal requirements,
especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, under the current PRC laws, an on-site inspection of our facilities by
any of these regulators may be limited or prohibited. 

The
PRC Securities Law was promulgated in December 1998 and was subsequently revised in October 2005, June 2013, August 2014 and December
2019. According to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities
regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While there
is no detailed interpretation regarding the rule implementation under Article 177, it will be difficult for an overseas securities regulator
to conduct investigation or evidence collection activities in China. 

If
we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to
expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation. 

U.S.
public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity has centered on financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial
accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result
of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies sharply decreased
in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC
enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide
scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on us, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable
allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such
allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from developing our
growth. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, we and our business operations will be severely affected and you could sustain
a significant decline in the value of our stock. 

The
disclosures in our reports, other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory
bodies in the PRC. 

We
are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements
are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings
are not subject to the review by China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is responsible for oversight of the capital
markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding
that no local regulator has done any review of us, our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements. 

Changes
in China s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. 

Our
organic fertilizer and agricultural products operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and
by continued economic growth in China as a whole. 

The
Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement,
level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented
measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and
the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still
owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development
by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China s economic growth through
allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential
treatment to particular industries or companies. 

While
the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various
sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation
of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.
In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace
of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China s economic growth has
slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations. 

21 

Uncertainties
in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us. 

The
PRC legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and regulations
are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are
not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties. 

Although
we have taken measures to comply with the laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations, including the regulatory
principles raised by the CBRC, and avoiding conducting any activities that may be deemed as illegal fund-raising, forming capital pool
or providing guarantee to investors under the current applicable laws and regulations, the PRC government authority may promulgate new
laws and regulations regulating the direct lending service industry in the future. We cannot assure you that our practices would not
be deemed to violate any PRC laws or regulations relating to illegal fund-raising, forming capital pools or the provision of credit enhancement
services. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PRC government will institute a license requirement covering our industry
at some point in the future. If such a licensing regime were introduced, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any newly
required license in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue
our operations. 

From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative
and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion
in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and
court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy, than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system
is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all) that may have
a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation.
Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and
procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operation. 

The relevant business currently carried out by
our PRC subsidiaries and our investment in the PRC subsidiaries currently are not subject to the national security review under applicable
PRC laws and regulations. However, if our future business operations or potential mergers and acquisitions we enter into in the PRC are
related to material infrastructure or other national security sensitive areas or industries involving certain key technologies, national
security review requirements will likely apply and the review result that is in compliance with PRC laws should be definitive. It remains
unclear when the specific implementation measures of the Foreign Investment Law will be issued by the State Council. Given the uncertainties
exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Foreign Investment Law, its application may require further rules to
be issued by Chinese government, which may incur and increase our compliance costs and expenses and accordingly our financial condition
and operation will be adversely affected. 

In the extreme case-scenario, we may be required
to unwind the contractual arrangement and/or dispose of the VIE or their subsidiaries, which could have a material and adverse effect
on our business, financial conditions and result of operations. 

Market, economic and other conditions in
China may adversely affect the demand for our products and services. 

Our industry depends upon the overall level of
economic conditions and consumer spending in China. A sustained deterioration in the general economic conditions in China, including any
turmoil in the economy, distresses in financial markets, or reduced market liquidity, as well as increased government intervention, may
reduce the number of our customers. Small-to-medium size business owners, in particular, are more susceptible to adverse changes in market,
economic and regulatory conditions and the level of consumption in China. As a result, the demand for our existing and new products and
services could decrease, and our financial performance could be adversely affected. 

Adverse market trends may affect our financial
performance. Such trends may include, but are not limited to, the followings: 

fluctuations in consumer demand, which reflect the prevailing
economic and demographic conditions; 

low levels of consumer and business confidence associated with
recessionary environments which may in turn reduce consumer spending. 

We may be adversely affected by the complexity,
uncertainties and changes in PRC regulation of internet-related businesses and companies, and any lack of requisite approvals, licenses
or permits applicable to our business may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

The PRC government extensively regulates the internet
industry, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies in the internet industry.
These internet-related laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant
uncertainties. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in
violation of applicable laws and regulations. 

22 

The evolving PRC regulatory system for the internet
industry may lead to the establishment of new regulatory agencies. For example, in May 2011, the State Council announced the establishment
of a new department, the State Internet Information Office (with the involvement of the State Council Information Office, the MITT, and
the Ministry of Public Security). The primary role of this new agency is to facilitate the policy-making and legislative development in
this field, to direct and coordinate with the relevant departments in connection with online content administration and to deal with cross-ministry
regulatory matters in relation to the internet industry. 

The Circular on Strengthening the Administration
of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business, issued by the MITT in July 2006, prohibits domestic
telecommunication service providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign
investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications
business in China. According to this circular, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication services operation permit or its shareholders
must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunication services.
The circular also requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations
and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. If an ICP License holder fails to comply with the requirements
and also fails to remedy such non-compliance within a specified period of time, the MITT or its local counterparts have the discretion
to take administrative measures against such license holder, including revoking its ICP License. 

The interpretation and application of existing
PRC laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies relating to the internet industry have created substantial
uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, internet businesses
in China, including our business. We cannot assure you that we have obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting our business
in China or will be able to maintain our existing licenses or obtain new ones. If the PRC government considers that we were operating
without the proper approvals, licenses or permits or promulgates new laws and regulations that require additional approvals or licenses
or imposes additional restrictions on the operation of any part of our business, it has the power, among other things, to levy fines,
confiscate our income, revoke our business licenses, and require us to discontinue our relevant business or impose restrictions on the
affected portion of our business. Any of these actions by the PRC government may have a material adverse effect on our business and results
of operations. 

PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment
in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from this offering and/or future financing
activities to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries. 

In July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on
Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment
through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which replaces the previous SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents,
including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities, to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect
offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any
offshore acquisitions that we may make in the future. 

Under SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make,
or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in offshore special purpose vehicles, or
SPVs, are required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect
shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material
change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with
the local branch of SAFE to reflect any material change. If any PRC resident shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration
or to update the registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from
any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions
into its subsidiaries in China. In February, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration
Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign
direct investments and outbound direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, must be filed with qualified banks
instead of SAFE. Qualified banks should examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE. We have used
our best efforts to notify PRC residents or entities who directly or indirectly hold shares in our Nevada holding company and who are
known to us as being PRC residents to complete the foreign exchange registrations. However, we may not be informed of the identities of
all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply
with SAFE registration requirements. We cannot assure you that all other shareholders or beneficial owners of ours who are PRC residents
or entities have complied with, and will in the future make, obtain or update any applicable registrations or approvals required by, SAFE
regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign
exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment
activities, and limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure,
which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

23 

Furthermore, as these foreign exchange and outbound
investment related regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and implementation has been constantly evolving, it is unclear
how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments and transactions, will be interpreted,
amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval
process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings,
which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able
to comply with all applicable foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC
domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary
approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability
to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

As an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiary,
we may make loans to our PRC subsidiary, the VIE and the VIE s subsidiaries, or may make additional capital contributions to our
PRC subsidiary, subject to satisfaction of applicable governmental registration and approval requirements. 

We may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiary
by means of capital contributions. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises in China, these capital
contributions are subject to registration with or approval by the MOFCOM or its local counterparts. In addition, the PRC government also
restricts the convertibility of foreign currencies into Renminbi and use of the proceeds. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular
19, which took effect and replaced certain previous SAFE regulations from June 1, 2015. SAFE further promulgated Circular 16, effective
on June 9, 2016, which, among other things, amend certain provisions of Circular 19. According to SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular
16, the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company
is regulated such that Renminbi capital may not be used for business beyond its business scope or to provide loans to persons other than
affiliates unless otherwise permitted under its business scope. Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe
penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. If the VIE requires financial
support from us or our wholly-owned subsidiary in the future and we find it necessary to use foreign currency-denominated capital to
provide such financial support, our ability to fund the VIE s operations will be subject to statutory limits and restrictions,
including those described above. These circulars may limit our ability to transfer the net proceeds from this offering to the VIE and
our PRC subsidiary, and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds from this offering into Renminbi to invest in or acquire any other
PRC companies in China. Despite the restrictions under these SAFE circulars, our PRC subsidiary may use its income in Renminbi generated
from their operations to finance the VIE through entrustment loans to the VIE or loans to the VIE s shareholders for the purpose
of making capital contributions to the VIE. In addition, our PRC subsidiary can use Renminbi funds converted from foreign currency registered
capital to carry out any activities within their normal course of business and business scope, including to purchase or lease servers
and other relevant equipment and fund other operational needs in connection with their provision of services to the relevant VIE under
the applicable exclusive technical support agreements. 

In light of the various requirements imposed by
PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be
able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with
respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiary or the VIE or future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete
such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we expect to receive from this offering and to fund our PRC
operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our
business. 

PRC laws and regulations governing our current
business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including those regarding the
enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes, with little advance notice, in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect
us and limit the legal protections available to you and us. 

There are substantial uncertainties regarding
the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business
and the enforcement and performance of our arrangements with customers in certain circumstances. The laws and regulations are sometimes
vague and may be subject to future changes, and their official interpretation and enforcement could be unpredictable, with little advance
notice. The effectiveness and interpretation of newly enacted laws or regulations, including amendments to existing laws and regulations,
may be delayed, and our business may be affected if we rely on laws and regulations which are subsequently adopted or interpreted in a
manner different from our understanding of these laws and regulations. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future
businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations
may have on our business. 

24 

Our WFOE, Shanghai Mufeng, VIE and its subsidiaries
are formed under and governed by the laws of the PRC. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the
common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. Since
these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws,
regulations and rules are not always uniform and the enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties. 

In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate
a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general, such as foreign investment, corporate organization
and governance, commerce, taxation and trade. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced
the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly,
the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves
uncertainties and sudden changes, sometimes with little advance notice. As a significant part of our business is conducted in China,
our operations are principally governed by PRC laws and regulations, which may limit legal protections available to us. Uncertainties
due to evolving laws and regulations could also impede the ability of a China-based company, such as our company, to obtain or maintain
permits or licenses required to conduct business in China. In the absence of required permits or licenses, governmental authorities could
impose material sanctions or penalties on us. In addition, some regulatory requirements issued by certain PRC government authorities
may not be consistently applied by other PRC government authorities (including local government authorities), thus making strict compliance
with all regulatory requirements impractical, or in some circumstances impossible. For example, we may have to resort to administrative
and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we enjoy either by law or contract. However, since PRC administrative and
court authorities have discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to predict
the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems.
Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely
basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules
until sometime after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and management attention. 

The PRC government has significant oversight and
discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further
regulatory, political and societal goals. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries
such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or
policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore,
the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over securities offerings and other capital markets
activities that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC
government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause
the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. 

Furthermore, if China adopts more stringent standards
with respect to certain areas such as environmental protection or corporate social responsibilities, we may incur increased compliance
costs or become subject to additional restrictions in our operations. Certain areas of the law, including intellectual property rights
and confidentiality protections in China may also not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. In addition, we cannot
predict the effects of future developments in the PRC legal system on our business operations, including the promulgation of new laws,
or changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available
to us and our investors, including you. 

We may become subject to a variety of laws
and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. We may be liable for improper use or
appropriation of personal information provided by our customers. 

We may become subject to a variety of laws and
regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. These laws and regulations are continuously
evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting,
particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, there are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection,
sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data. Such laws and regulations often vary
in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. 

25 

We expect to obtain information about various
aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees and third parties. We also maintain information about various aspects of
our operations as well as regarding our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical
to our business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. We are required by applicable
laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such
information. 

The PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment
7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees
from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained during the course of performing duties
or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of
the PRC National People s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June
1, 2017. 

Pursuant to the Cyber Security Law, network operators
must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users personal information necessary
to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products and services and shall comply
with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and regulations. 

The Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National
People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides main legal basis for privacy and personal information
infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and the Ministry
of Public Security have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection. 

The PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity
are constantly evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry
of Public Security and the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and
interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020.
According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when
purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. 

In November 2016, the Standing Committee of China s
National People s Congress passed China s first Cybersecurity Law CSL ), which became effective in June 2017.
The CSL is the first PRC law that systematically lays out the regulatory requirements on cybersecurity and data protection, subjecting
many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny. The legal consequences of violation of
the CSL include penalties of warning, confiscation of illegal income, suspension of related business, winding up for rectification, shutting
down the websites, and revocation of business license or relevant permits. In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain
other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and
services which do or may affect national security. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of
the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments Draft Measures ), which required that, in addition to operator
of critical information infrastructure, any data processor carrying out data processing activities that affect or
may affect national security should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when
assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities, including, among others, (i) the risk of core data, important data or
a large amount of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited the country; and (ii) the risk of
critical information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled, or
maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad. The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that under the proposed
rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations
because of the risk that such data and personal information could be affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign
governments, The cybersecurity review will also investigate the potential national security risks from overseas IPOs. We do not
know what regulations will be adopted or how such regulations will affect us and our listing on Nasdaq. In the event that the Cyberspace
Administration of China determines that we are subject to these regulations, we may be required to delist from Nasdaq and we may be subject
to fines and penalties. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the NPC promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which will take effect
on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for entities and individuals handling
personal data, including that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal means, and the collection and
use of such data should not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, CSL and any other
cybersecurity and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business.
Further, if the enacted version of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review mandates clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific
actions to be completed by companies like us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all. 

If the new PRC Data Security Law is enacted in
September, we will not be subject to the cybersecurity review by the CAC for this offering, given that: (i) our products and services
are offered not directly to individual users but through our institutional customers; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal
information in our business operations; and (iii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus
may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities. However, there remains uncertainty as to how the Draft Measures will
be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or
detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Draft Measures. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation
and interpretation comes into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of
such laws on us. 

26 

We cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies,
including the CAC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that we can fully or timely comply with such laws. In
the event that we are subject to any mandatory cybersecurity review and other specific actions required by the CAC, we face uncertainty
as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required
to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

Failure to make adequate contributions to
various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties. 

We are required under PRC laws and regulations
to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented
payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances,
of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where we operate our businesses.
The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different
levels of economic development in different locations. We have not made adequate employee benefit payments. We may be required to make
up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the
underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

The recent joint statement by the SEC and
PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent
criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors
who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to our offering. 

On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and
PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated
with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized
the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in
emerging markets. 

On May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals
with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in Restrictive Market , (ii)
adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply
additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company s auditors. 

On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the
PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is
unable to inspect the company s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited to trade on a
national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives
approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed
into law. 

On March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had
adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim
final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR
with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined
it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. The SEC will implement
a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing
that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction, and will also require disclosure in the registrant s
annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant. 

27 

On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating
Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the
number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the prohibitions under the HFCAA from three years to two, and thus,
would reduce the time before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. 

On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final
rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether
the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because
of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. 

On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments
to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies
as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. 

On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report
on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in
mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. 

On February 4, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2022 (the
 America COMPETES Act ). If the America COMPETES Act is enacted into law, it would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC
to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for
two consecutive years instead of three. 

Our auditor, WWC, P.C., the independent registered
public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this prospectus, as a firm headquartered in California and registered
with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess our auditor s
compliance with the applicable professional standards with the last inspection in November 2021, and as of the date of this prospectus,
our auditor is not subject to the PCAOB determinations. However, in the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect
or investigate completely the auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection
could cause trading in the Company s securities to be prohibited under the HFCAA, and ultimately result in a determination by a
securities exchange to delist the Company s securities. 

On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed the SOP
Agreements with the CSRC and China s Ministry of Finance. The SOP Agreements established a specific, accountable framework to make
possible complete inspections and investigations by the PCAOB of audit firms based in Mainland China and Hong Kong, as required under
U.S. law. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determinations
that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and
Hong Kong. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainties and depends on a number of factors out of our and our
auditor s control. The PCAOB continues to demand complete access in mainland China and Hong Kong moving forward and is making plans
to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations
as needed. The PCAOB has also indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations with the HFCAA
if needed. 

28 

In addition, the recent developments would add
uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and more stringent
criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality control procedures, adequacy of
personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial statements.
It remains unclear what the SEC s implementation process related to the above rules will entail or what further actions the SEC,
the PCAOB or Nasdaq will take to address these issues and what impact those actions will have on U.S. companies that have significant
operations in Hong Kong and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange (including a national securities exchange or over-the-counter
stock market). In addition, the above amendments and any additional actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to
increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could create some uncertainty for investors, the market price of our ordinary share
could be adversely affected, and we could be delisted if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement or being
required to engage a new audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time.. 

Trading in our securities may be prohibited
under the HFCAA and as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable
to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction. 

The HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The
HFCAA states if the SEC determines that a company has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been
subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such shares from being traded
on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. 

On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final
rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. A company will be required to
comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a non-inspection year under a process to be subsequently established
by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements
described above. 

Despite that we have a U.S.-based auditor that
is registered with the PCAOB and subject to PCAOB inspection, there are still risks to the company and investors if it is later determined
that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction.
Such risks include, but are not limited to that trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA and as a result an exchange
may determine to delist our securities. 

The M A Rules and certain other PRC
regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult
for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of
Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006 and amended in 2009,
and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could
make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances
that the MOC be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic
enterprise. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the MOC shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if
certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the MOC that became effective in September 2011 specify
that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions
through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns
are subject to strict review by the MOC, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring
the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary
businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions
could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOC or its local counterparts may
delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market
share. 

29 

Any failure to comply with PRC regulations
regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other
legal or administrative sanctions. 

In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices
on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed
Company, replacing earlier rules promulgated in March 2007. Pursuant to these rules, PRC citizens and non-PRC citizens who reside in China
for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company,
subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiary
of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition, an overseas entrusted institution must be retained
to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale of shares and interests. We, our executive
officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who have resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and
who have been granted options or other awards are subject to these regulations. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject
them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiary and limit our
PRC subsidiary ability to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to
adopt additional incentive plans for our directors, executive officers and employees under PRC law. 

Regulatory bodies of the United States may
be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China. 

From time to time, the Company may receive requests
from certain U.S. agencies to investigate or inspect the Company s operations or to otherwise provide information. While the Company
will be compliant with these requests from these regulators, there is no guarantee that such requests will be honored by those entities
who provide services to us or with whom we associate, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, an on-site inspection
of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or entirely prohibited. Such inspections, though permitted by the Company
and its affiliates, are subject to the capricious nature of Chinese enforcers and may therefore be impossible to facilitate. 

The recent joint statement by the SEC and
PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent
criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors
who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to our offering. 

On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and
PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks associated
with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement emphasized
the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks of fraud in
emerging markets. 

On May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed three proposals
with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in Restrictive Market , (ii)
adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii) apply
additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company s auditors. 

On May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign government if the
PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is
unable to inspect the Company s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited to trade on a
U.S. stock exchange. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. On
December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law. 

On March 24, 2021, the SEC announced that it had
adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim
final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR
with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined
it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. The SEC will implement
a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to submit documentation to the SEC establishing
that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction, and will also require disclosure in the registrant s
annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence on, such a registrant. 

On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed a bill
which, if passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law, would reduce the number of consecutive non-inspection years
required for triggering the prohibitions under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act from three years to two. 

30 

On
December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the Holding
Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit
report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or
investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. 

On
December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. 

On
August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (SOP) Agreement with the CSRC and the MOF of the PRC regarding cooperation
in the oversight of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong. The SOP remains unpublished and is subject to
further interpretation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the SOP disclosed by the SEC, the SOP seeks to
establish a method for the PCAOB to conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in the PRC and Hong Kong, as contemplated
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Under the agreement, (a) the PCAOB has sole discretion to select the firms, audit engagements and potential
violations it inspects and investigates without consultation with, or input from, PRC authorities; (b) procedures are in place for PCAOB
inspectors and investigators to view complete audit work papers with all information included and for the PCAOB to retain information
as needed; (c) the PCAOB has direct access to interview and take testimony from all personnel associated with the audits the PCAOB inspects
or investigates; and (d) the PCAOB shall have the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and the SEC can use the information for all regulatory purposes, including administrative or civil enforcement actions. The PCAOB
is required to reassess its determinations as to whether it is able to carry out inspections and investigations completely and without
obstruction by the end of 2022. 

On
December 15, 2022, the PCAOB determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public
accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations. However, should PRC authorities
obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB will consider the need to issue a new determination. 

Our
auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit report included elsewhere in this prospectus, as an
auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United
States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess our auditor s compliance with the applicable professional
standards. Our auditor is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the
last inspection in October 2019, and our auditor is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. Despite
that we have a U.S. based auditor that is registered with the PCAOB and subject to PCAOB inspection, there are still risks to the company
and investors if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position
taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction. Such risks include but not limited to that trading in our securities may be prohibited
under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and as a result an exchange may determine to delist our securities. 

These
recent developments would add uncertainties to our offering and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply
additional and more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality
control procedures, adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to
the audit of our financial statements. It remains unclear what the SEC s implementation process related to the March 2021 interim
final amendments will entail or what further actions the SEC, the PCAOB or Nasdaq will take to address these issues and what impact those
actions will have on U.S. companies that have significant operations in the PRC and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange (including
a national securities exchange or over-the-counter stock market). In addition, the March 2021 interim final amendments and any additional
actions, proceedings, or new rules resulting from these efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could create
some uncertainty for investors, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, trading in our securities may be prohibited
 and we could be delisted if we and our auditor are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement or being required to engage
a new audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time. 

The M A Rules and certain other PRC
regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult
for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of
Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006 and amended in 2009,
and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could
make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances
that the MOC be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise.
For example, the M A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor
takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact
or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds
a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the SCNPC effective in 2008 requires that
transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (i.e., during the previous fiscal
year, (i) the total global turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB10 billion and at least two of these
operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China, or (ii) the total turnover within China of all the operators participating
in the concentration exceeded RMB 2 billion, and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB 400 million within
China) must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed. 

31 

Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that
the MOC shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security
review rules issued by the MOC that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that
raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de
facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns are subject to strict review by the MOC, and
the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or
contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements
of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval
processes, including obtaining approval from the MOC or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions,
which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. 

The approval of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission may be required in connection with this offering, and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such
approval. 

The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of
Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies requires an overseas special purpose
vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain
the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle s
securities on an overseas stock exchange. 

Our PRC counsel has advised us based on their
understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations that the CSRC s approval is not required for the listing and trading
of our common stock on Nasdaq in the context of this offering, given that: (i) our PRC subsidiary was incorporated as a wholly foreign-owned
enterprise by means of direct investment rather than by merger or acquisition of equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned
by PRC companies or individuals as defined under the M A Rules that are our beneficial owners; (ii) the CSRC currently has not issued
any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like ours under this prospectus are subject to the M A Rules; and
(iii) no provision in the M A Rules clearly classifies contractual arrangements as a type of transaction subject to the M A Rules. 

However, our PRC counsel has further advised us
that there remains some uncertainties as to how the M A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering
and its opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in
any form relating to the M A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the
same conclusion as we do. If it is determined that CSRC approval is required for this offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other
PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek CSRC approval for this offering. These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations
in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from this
offering into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions
that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as
well as the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring
us, or making it advisable for us, to halt this offering before the settlement and delivery of the common stock that we are offering.
Consequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement and delivery of the common
stock we are offering, you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur. 

Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry 

Our fertilizer business is seasonal and
affected by factors beyond our control, which may cause our sales and operating results to fluctuate significantly. 

The sale of products from our fertilizer-related
segments is partially dependent upon planting and growing seasons, which vary from year to year, and are expected to result in both seasonal
patterns and substantial fluctuations in quarterly sales and profitability. Different from the traditional organic fertilizer that mostly
be only used as starter fertilizer, our products can be used as both the starter fertilizer and regular fertilizer, which can be applied
during all the periods through the crops growth. Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as heavy rains, hail, floods, freezing
conditions, windstorms or fire, also affect decisions by our distributors, direct customers and end users about the types and amounts
of products to use and the timing of harvesting and planting. As we increase our sales in our current markets and expand into new markets
in different geographies, it is possible that we may experience different seasonality patterns in our business.

Disruptions may lead to delays in harvesting or
planting by growers which can result in pushing orders to a future quarter, which could negatively affect results for the quarter in question
and cause fluctuations in our operating results. Seasonal variations may be especially pronounced because our product lines are mainly
sold in China. Planting and growing seasons, climatic conditions and other variables on which sales of our products are dependent vary
from year to year and quarter to quarter. As a result, we may experience substantial fluctuations in quarterly sales. 

The overall level of seasonality in our business
is difficult to evaluate as a result of our relatively early stage of development, our limited number of commercialized products, our
expansion into new geographical territories, the introduction of new products and the timing of introductions of new products. Even though
we have implemented safety measures, the Company had insufficient inventory in April, May, October and November. It is possible that our
business may be more seasonal or experience seasonality in different periods than anticipated. Other factors may also contribute to the
unpredictability of our operating results, including the size and timing of significant distributor transactions, the delay or deferral
of use of our commercial technology or products and the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our direct customers, distributors, licensees
and end users. Customers may purchase large quantities of our products in a particular quarter to store and use over long periods of time
or time their purchases to manage their inventories, which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular
quarter or year. 

Unavoidable Insufficient Inventory during
busy seasons may cause us to lose some portion of our sales. 

Traditional organic fertilizers do have seasonal
sales because their use can only be applied as starter fertilizers before the crops are planted. Our organic fertilizers can be used
as a starter fertilizer or as regular fertilizers which can be applied during the entire growing period of the crops to supplement the
nutrients needed for growth. The Company s inventory during the peak seasons (such as April to May, and October to November) is
insufficient. The Company s fertilizer production capacity has been upgraded from the original 50,000 tons to 70,000 tons, however,
and the seasonal inventory supply gap is still unavoidable. The inevitable inventory shortage may cause us to lose some portion of our
sales. 

Competition in fertilizer and agricultural
industrial products is intense and requires continuous technological development. 

We currently face significant direct and indirect
competition in the markets in which we operate. The markets for fertilizers are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Many companies
engage in the development of fertilizers, and speed in commercializing a new product can be a significant competitive advantage. 

In most segments of the fertilizer markets, the
number of products available to end customers is steadily increasing as new products are introduced. We may be unable to compete successfully
against our current and future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins and the inability to achieve market
acceptance for products containing our seed traits and technology. In addition, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial,
marketing, sales, distribution and technical resources than us, and some of our competitors have more experience in R D, regulatory
matters, manufacturing and marketing. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and new technologies
become available. Programs to improve genetics and crop protection chemicals are generally concentrated within a relatively small number
of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with a broader set of companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the plant science,
specialty food ingredient and agricultural biotechnology seed and chemical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated
among a smaller number of our competitors. 

Our technology may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical
by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors, which will prevent or limit our
ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of our seed traits and technology. At the same time, the expiration of patents
covering existing products reduces the barriers to entry for competitors. Our ability to compete effectively and to achieve commercial
success depends, in part, on our ability to control manufacturing and marketing costs; effectively price and market our products, successfully
develop an effective marketing program and an efficient supply chain, develop new products with properties attractive to food manufacturers
or growers and commercialize our products quickly without incurring major regulatory costs. We may not be successful in achieving these
factors and any such failure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

33 

We may not be successful in developing marketable
or commercial technologies. 

Through our patented technology, we process crop
straw in three hours (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic nutritious fertilizer rich in small
molecules, easily absorbed by crops. Our success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop high value fertilizer and agriculture
industrial technologies for use in commercial products. Through our technology sourcing and product development collaborations we commit
substantial efforts and other resources to accomplish this. It may take several years, if at all, before many of our products complete
the development process and become available for production and commercialization. 

As of the date of this registration statement,
many of our products have been commercialized by our patented technology. There can be no assurance that our future fertilizer productivity
and agriculture industrial technologies will be viable for commercial use, or that we will be able to generate revenues from those technologies,
in a significant manner or at all. If seeds or other products that utilize our fertilizer or technology are unsuccessful in achieving
their desired effect or otherwise fail to be commercialized, we will not receive revenues from our customers or royalty payments from
the commercialization of the fertilizer and technologies we develop, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and growth strategy. 

Fertilizers containing the following traits or
biological treatments that we develop may be unsuccessful or fail to achieve commercialization for any of the following reasons: 

our fertilizers may not be successfully validated in the target crops 

our fertilizers may not have the desired effect on the relevant crop sought by our end market 

We, our joint ventures or collaborators may be unable to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for the fertilizers 

our competitors may launch competing or more effective fertilizers 

we may be unable to patent and/or obtain breeders rights or any other intellectual property rights on our traits and technologies in the necessary jurisdictions 

even if we obtain patent and/or breeders rights or any other intellectual property rights on our fertilizers or processing technologies, such rights may be later challenged by competitors or other parties and 

even if we obtain patent and/or breeders rights or any other intellectual property rights on our fertilizers, competitors may design competing products that do not infringe these intellectual property rights. 

If we are unable to compete successfully
with our competitors, our financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. 

We encounter intense competition in each of our
business segments on a national, regional and local level. Competition in the industry is primarily based on quality of services, brand
name recognition, geographic coverage and range of services. New and existing competitors may offer competitive rates, greater convenience
or superior services, which could attract customers away from us, resulting in lower revenues for our operations. Competition among fertilizer
companies may cause a decrease in price of sales to attract or retain talented employees. 

Our major competitors are Shijiazhuang Xixing
Fertilizer Science and Technology Limited, Nanjing Ningliang Bio-chemistry Engineering Limited, Shijiazhuang Jintaiyang Biology Organic
Fertilizer Limited, Beijing Wotu Tiandi Biological Science Limited, Zhenzhou Yongfeng Biology Fertilizer Limited, Shandong Jianong Biological
Engineering Limited, Beijing Aeronautics Hengfeng Technology Limited, Beijing Century Armstrong Biological Technology Limited, GengLiduo
Biological Technology Limited. 

34 

We do not have multinational competitors. Due
to the high price of organic fertilizers from other countries, China has few organic fertilizer imports. The fertilizers produced by international
fertilizer companies entering the Chinese organic fertilizer market are mainly special functional fertilizers such as foliar fertilizers.
These functional fertilizers are not selling well in the domestic market due to high price. 

Some of our competitors may have a broader national
presence than us, a more established branding recognition than us in major markets and more financial or other resources than us. Others
may have smaller aggregate businesses than us but may be more established and have greater market presence and brand name recognition
on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large national and international companies. These companies
may have more financial or other resources than us. If we fail to compete effectively, our business operations and financial condition
will suffer. 

The loss of any of our key suppliers and/or
customers could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 

We consider our major suppliers in each period to be those suppliers
that accounted for more than 10 of overall purchases in such period. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 77 and 45 of our
supplies came from five and two key suppliers, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 76 of our supplies came from two key
suppliers. Although we believe that we can locate replacement suppliers readily on the market for prevailing prices and that we may not
have significant difficulty replacing a given supplier, any difficulty in replacing such a supplier could adversely affect our company s
performance to the extent it results in higher prices, slower supply chain and ultimately less desirable results of operations. 

In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, two key
customers accounted for 71 and 78 of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two key customers accounted for
78 of our revenues. As the majority of our revenues are driven by individual orders for organic fertilizers, there can be no assurance
that we will maintain or improve the relationships with customers who do not have long-term contracts with us. Our major customers often
change each period based on when a given order is placed. If we cannot maintain long-term relationships with major customers or replace
major customers from period to period with equivalent customers, the loss of such sales could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

We have engaged in transactions with related
parties, and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of
operations. 

We have entered into a number of transactions with related parties,
including our shareholders, directors and executive officers. For example, for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we have due to related
paties balance of 897,821, 102,007,and 45,080, respectively, from Mr. Lirong Wang,Ms. Xueying Sheng, and Mr. Guohua Lin. See Related
Party Transactions. We may in the future enter into additional transactions with entities in which members of our board of
directors and other related parties hold ownership interests. 

Transactions with the entities in which related
parties hold ownership interests present potential for conflicts of interest, as the interests of these entities and their shareholders
may not align with the interests of the Company and our unaffiliated shareholders with respect to the negotiation of, and certain other
matters related to, our purchases from and other transactions with such entities. Conflicts of interest may also arise in connection with
the exercise of contractual remedies under these transactions, such as the treatment of events of default. 

Currently, our Board of Directors has authorized
the Audit Committee upon its formation to review and approve all material related party transaction. We rely on the laws of the State
of Nevada, which provide that directors owe a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to our company. Nevertheless, we may have achieved more
favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties and these transactions, individually or in the aggregate,
may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations or may result in government enforcement actions or other litigation. 

35 

Our product development cycle is lengthy
and uncertain and we may never generate revenues or earn revenues on the sale of our products currently in development. 

The research and development in the crop productivity
and agriculture biotech industries is expensive, complex, prolonged and uncertain. We may spend many years and dedicate significant financial
and other resources developing products that may never generate revenues or come to market. Our process of developing and commercializing
technologies involves several phases and can take several years from discovery to commercialization of a product. 

Development of new or improved agricultural products
involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative and complex technologies. These risks include the
possibility that: 

our products will fail to perform as expected in the field 

our products will not receive necessary regulatory permits and governmental clearances in the markets in which we intend to sell them 

our products may have adverse effects on consumers 

consumer preferences, which are unpredictable and can vary greatly, may change quickly, making our products no longer desirable 

our competitors develop new products that have other more appealing characteristics than our products 

our products will be viewed as too expensive by food companies or growers as compared to competitive products 

our products will be difficult to produce on a large scale or will not be economical to grow 

intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties will prevent us, our research and development partners or our licensees from marketing and selling our products 

we may be unable to patent or otherwise obtain intellectual property protection for our discoveries in the necessary jurisdictions 

we or the customers that we sell our products to may be unable to fully develop or commercialize our products in a timely manner or at all and 

third parties may develop superior or equivalent products. 

We intend to continue to invest in research and
development including additional and expanded field testing to validate potential products in real world conditions. Because of the long
product development cycle and the complexities and uncertainties associated with biotech and agricultural industrial technologies, there
can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenues from the technologies or products that we are currently developing
without significant delay, without the incurrence of unanticipated costs or at all. 

We depend on our key personnel and research
employees, and we may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain qualified scientific and business personnel. 

Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit
and maintain highly skilled and qualified individuals through direct employment or collaboration arrangements, with expertise in a range
of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, plant genetics, agronomics, mathematics programming and other subjects relevant to our business.
Our ability to recruit such a work force depends in part on our ability to maintain our market leadership in agricultural biotech industry
in China. Maintaining our ability to attract highly-skilled workers and leading scientific institutions depends in part on our ability
to maintain a strong technology platform and state-of-the-art facilities, as well as our ability to consistently and successfully commercialize
our technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain leading scientific capabilities or continue to successfully
maintain advanced technology in the market. 

36 

We do not enter into non-compete agreements
with our employees, and therefore we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former employees. 

We do not enter into non-compete agreements with
our employees, which prevents us from limiting our key employees from joining our competitors or competing directly against us. As a result,
we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of such employees. Direct competition by a former employee
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on our proprietary information. 

We have a limited operating history in our
market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. 

We started engaging in our business in the last
few years and have limited revenues to date. As our business develops or responds to competition, we may continue to introduce new products
and services or make adjustments to our existing offerings and business model. In connection with the introduction of new products or
in response to general economic conditions, we may impose more stringent borrower qualifications to ensure the quality of loans facilitated
by our companies, which may negatively affect the growth of our business. Any significant change to our business model may not achieve
expected results and may have a material and adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations. It is therefore difficult
to effectively assess our future prospects. The risks and challenges we encounter or may encounter in this developing and rapidly evolving
market may have impacts on our business and prospects. These risks and challenges include our ability to, among other things: 

navigate an evolving regulatory environment; 

expand the base of borrowers and lenders; 

broaden our loan product offerings; 

enhance our risk management capabilities; 

improve our operational efficiency; 

cultivate a vibrant consumer finance ecosystem; 

maintain the security of our IT infrastructure and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across our platform; 

attract, retain and motivate talented employees; and 

defend ourselves against litigation, regulatory, intellectual property, privacy or other claims. 

If we fail to educate potential borrowers and
lenders about the value of our services, if the market for our services does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs
of our target market, or other risks and challenges, our business and results of operations will be harmed. 

The loss of any of our key customers could
reduce our revenues and our profitability. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue from two customers
represented 78 and 71 of our revenue, respectively. As the majority of our revenues are driven by individual orders for fertilizer products,
there can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve the relationships with customers who do not have long-term contracts with us.
Our major customers often change each period based on when a given order is placed. If we cannot maintain long-term relationships with
major customers or replace major customers from period to period with equivalent customers, the loss of such sales could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

37 

Any failure of any of our key suppliers
to deliver necessary materials could result in delays in our products development or marketing schedules. 

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, five and two suppliers
accounted for 77 and 45 of our purchases, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two suppliers accounted for 76 of our
purchases, respectively. We are dependent on our suppliers for our products. Our suppliers may fail to meet timelines or contractual obligations
or provide us with sufficient products, which may adversely affect our business. Certain of our contracts with key suppliers can be terminated
by the supplier upon giving notice within a certain period and restrict us from using other suppliers. Failure to appropriately structure
or adequately manage our agreements with third parties may adversely affect our supply of products. We are also subject to credit risk
with respect to our third-party suppliers. If any such suppliers become insolvent, an appointed trustee could potentially ignore the service
contracts we have in place with such party, resulting in increased charges or the termination of the service contracts. We may not be
able to replace a service provider within a reasonable period of time, on as favorable terms or without disruption to our operations.
Any adverse changes to our relationships with third-party suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our image, brand and reputation,
as well as on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, to the extent that our creditworthiness
might be impaired, or general economic conditions decline, certain of our key suppliers may demand onerous payment terms that could materially
adversely affect our working capital position, or such suppliers may refuse to continue to supply to us. A number of our key suppliers
have taken out trade credit insurance on our ability to pay them. To the extent that such trade credit insurance becomes unobtainable
or more expensive due to market conditions, we may face adverse changes to payment terms by our key suppliers, or they may refuse to continue
to supply us. 

We may have difficulty managing the risk
associated with doing business in the Chinese fertilizer and agricultural products industry. 

In general, the fertilizer and agricultural products
industry in China is affected by a series of factors, including, but not limited to, natural, economic and social such as climate, market,
technology, regulation, and globalization, which makes risk management difficult. Fertilizer and agricultural products operations in China
face similar risks as present in other countries, however, in the PRC these can either be mitigated or exacerbated due to governmental
intervention through policy promulgation and implementation either in the fertilizer and agricultural products or sectors which provide
critical inputs to fertilizer and agricultural products such as energy or outputs such as transportation. While not an exhaustive list,
the following factors could significantly affect our ability to do business: 

food, feed, and energy demand; 

agricultural, financial, energy and renewable energy and trade policies; 

input and output pricing due to market factors and regulatory policies; 

production and crop progress due to adverse weather conditions, equipment deliveries, and water and irrigation conditions; and 

infrastructure conditions and policies. 

Currently, we do not hold and do not intend to
purchase insurance policies to protect revenue in the case that the above conditions cause losses of revenue. 

If we do not compete effectively, our results
of operations could be harmed. 

Our industry in China is intensely competitive
and evolving. Our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate selectively in different
market segments. They may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory, technological and other developments.
Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and
may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their services. Our competitors may also have
longer operating histories, more extensive borrower or lender bases, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty and broader partner relationships
than us. Additionally, a current or potential competitor may acquire one or more of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance
with one or more of our competitors. If we are unable to compete with such companies and meet the need for innovation in our industry,
the demand for our services could stagnate or substantially decline, we could experience reduced revenues or our services could fail to
achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. 

38 

If we fail to promote and maintain our
brand in an effective and cost-efficient way, our business and results of operations may be harmed. 

The continued development and success of our business
relies on the recognition of our brands. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand effectively is critical to
attracting new and retaining existing borrowers and lenders to our services. Successful promotion of our brand and our ability to attract
qualified borrowers and sufficient lenders depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the success of the channels
we use to promote our services. Our efforts to build our brand have caused us to incur significant expenses, and it is likely that our
future marketing efforts will require us to incur significant additional expenses. These efforts may not result in increased revenues
in the immediate future or at all and, even if they do, any increases in revenues may not offset the expenses incurred. If we fail to
successfully promote and maintain our brand while incurring substantial expenses, our results of operations and financial condition would
be adversely affected, which may impair our ability to grow our business. 

If we fail to develop and maintain an effective
system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm
has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. We also have a history of not filing our periodic reports
on time due to uncontrollable reasons. As defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the
United States, or PCAOB, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

One material weakness that has been identified
related to our lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting
requirements to properly address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures to fulfil U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements. The other material weakness that has been identified
related to our lack of comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

We have implemented a number of measures to address the material weaknesses
that have been identified in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the two years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. However, there is no assurance that we will not have any material weakness in the future. Failure to discover and address
any control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and impair our ability to comply with applicable financial
reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. Moreover, ineffective internal control over financial reporting
could significantly hinder our ability to prevent fraud. Ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased
risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory
investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. 

Failure to maintain effective internal controls
in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

If we fail to comply with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal control over financial reporting or to remedy any material weaknesses in our
internal controls that we may identify, such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares. 

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and current SEC regulations,
we are required to prepare assessments regarding internal controls over financial reporting. In connection with our on-going assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may discover material weaknesses in our internal
controls as defined in standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB. A material weakness is a
significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The PCAOB defines significant deficiency 
as a deficiency that results in more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential
will not be prevented or detected. We determined that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting are not effective
and were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

The process of designing and implementing effective
internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory
environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations
as a public company. We cannot assure you that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial process and reporting
in the future or that the measures we will take will remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify in the future. 

39 

Our business depends on the continued efforts
of our senior management. If one or more of our key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business
may be severely disrupted. 

Our business operations depend on the continued
services of our senior management, particularly the executive officers named in this prospectus. While we have provided different incentives
to our management, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. We currently do not carry a key man 
life insurance on the officers. Therefore, if one or more of our key executives are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions,
we may incur substantial cost or may not be able to replace them at all. Consequently, our future growth may be constrained, our business
may be severely disrupted, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If that is
the case, we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel. In addition, although we have entered into
confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our management, there is no assurance that any member of our management team will
not join our competitors or form a competing business. If any dispute arises between our current or former officers and us, we may have
to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements in China or we may be unable to enforce them at all. 

Competition for employees is intense, and
we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified and skilled employees needed to support our business. 

We believe our success depends on the efforts
and talent of our employees, including risk management, software engineering, financial and marketing personnel. Our future success depends
on our continued ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical,
risk management and financial personnel is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels
consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees
have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. 

In addition, we invest significant time and expenses
in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees,
we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements, and the quality of our services and our ability to serve
borrowers and lenders could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business. 

Increases in labor costs in the PRC may
adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

The economy in China has experienced increases
in inflation and labor costs in recent years. As a result, average wages in the PRC are expected to continue to increase. In addition,
we are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pension, housing fund, medical insurance,
work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our
employees. The relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the statutory employee benefits,
and those employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. We expect that
our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to control our labor costs or pass
on these increased labor costs to our users by increasing the fees of our services, our financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected. 

We do not have any business insurance coverage. 

Insurance companies in China currently do not
offer as extensive of an array of insurance products as insurance companies in more developed economies do. Currently, we do not have
any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks
and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such
insurance. Any uninsured business disruptions may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

40 

We face Risks Relating to natural disasters,
health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations. 

We are vulnerable to natural disasters and other
calamities. Fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, war, riots, terrorist attacks or
similar events may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns, system failures, technology service failures or internet failures, which
could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware, as well as adversely affect our ability to provide
products and services on our service. 

Our business could also be adversely affected
by the effects of virus, flu and other diseases. Our business operations could be disrupted if any of our employees is suspected of having
virus, flu and other diseases, since it could require our employees to be quarantined and/or our offices to be disinfected. In addition,
our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any of these epidemics harms the Chinese economy in general. 

We may be subject to the general risks underlying
the agriculture industry in PRC market. 

The agriculture industry in the PRC market has
been mature. Particularly, we are principally engaged in the fertilizer processing and distribution business in the People s Republic
of China. Therefore, we need to be cautious in selecting our business focus and expansion strategy, and we should be constantly aware
of the innovation risk, technology risk and market risk in the industries. If we fail to make an accurate judgment of the current market,
our performance can be severely impacted. 

We may be adversely affected by global economic
conditions. 

Our ability to continue to develop and grow our
business, build proprietary distribution channels and generate revenues from product sales and royalty payments may be adversely affected
by global economic conditions in the future, including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating
commodity prices and interest rates, volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy such as the changing
financial regulatory environment. For example, our customers and licensees may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow
shortages or difficulties obtaining financing, which could adversely affect the demand for our technologies, products and services. In
addition, our earnings may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of certain commodities, such as grains, milk, meat, biofuels
and biomaterials. If commodity prices are negatively impacted, the value of our products could be directly and negatively impacted. Additionally,
growers incomes have historically been negatively affected by commodity prices. As a result, fluctuations in commodity prices could
have an impact on growers purchasing decisions and negatively affect their ability and decisions to purchase our seeds or products
that incorporate our proprietary technology. We cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial
market conditions could adversely impact our business. 

Changes in laws and regulations to which
we are subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, may materially increase our costs of operation, decrease our operating
revenues and disrupt our business. 

Laws and regulatory standards and procedures that
impact our business are continuously changing. Responding to these changes and meeting existing and new requirements may be costly and
burdensome. Changes in laws and regulations may occur that could: 

impair or eliminate our ability to source technology and develop our products, including validating our products through field trials and passing biosafety evaluations 

increase our compliance and other costs of doing business through increases in the cost to protect our intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets and regulatory data, or increases in the cost to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize and market the products we develop directly or jointly 

require significant product redesign or redevelopment 

render our seed traits and technology and products that incorporate them less profitable or less attractive compared to competing products 

reduce the amount of revenues we receive from government grants, licenses or other royalties and 

discourage us and other collaborators from offering, and end markets from purchasing, products that incorporate our seed traits and technology. 

Any of these events could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legislation and jurisprudence on intellectual property in the key
markets where we seek protection, primarily in China, is evolving and changes in laws could affect our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual
property protection for our products. Any changes to these existing laws and regulations may materially increase our costs, decrease our
revenues and disrupt our business. 

41 

The overall agricultural industry is susceptible
to commodity price changes and we, along with our food manufacturing customers and grower customers, are exposed to market risks from
changes in commodity prices. 

Changes in the prices of certain commodity products
could result in higher overall cost along the agricultural supply chain, which may negatively affect our ability to commercialize our
products We will be susceptible to changes in costs in the agricultural industry as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general
economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.
As a result, we may not be able to anticipate or react to changing costs by adjusting our practices, which could cause our operating results
to deteriorate. 

Our operations are subject to various health
and environmental risks associated with our use, handling and disposal of potentially toxic materials. 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local
and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, the handling, use,
storage, treatment, manufacture and disposal of wastes, discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. 

Although there are no hazardous substances in
the raw materials used by us that will affect and damage the company s employees, factory, other property and the environment. The
safety of raw materials is also one of the requirements when applying for the fertilizer registration certificate. We cannot completely
eliminate the risk of contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. If these risks were to materialize, we
could be subject to fines, liability, reputational harm or otherwise adverse effects on our business. We may be sued for any injury or
contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, or may otherwise be required to remedy the contamination,
and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Furthermore, compliance with environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our Research Development efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements,
we could incur substantial costs and liabilities, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures
for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on
our business of new or amended environmental, health and safety laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws
and regulations are interpreted and enforced. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production
efforts. 

Failure to maintain or enhance our brands
or image could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

We believe our brands are associated with a well-recognized,
integrated fertilizers company in the local markets that it operates, with consistent high-quality products end customers in China. Our
brands are integral to our sales and marketing efforts. Our continued success in maintaining and enhancing our brand and image depends
to a large extent on our ability to satisfy customer needs by further developing and maintaining quality of services across our operations,
as well as our ability to respond to competitive pressures. If we are unable to satisfy customer needs or if our public image or reputation
were otherwise diminished, our business transactions with our customers may decline, which could in turn adversely affect our results
of operations. 

Any failure to protect our trademarks and
other intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our business. 

We believe our intellectual property rights are
critical to our success. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive advantages and business.
Implementation of Chinese intellectual property-related laws have historically been lacking, primarily because of ambiguities in Chinese
laws and enforcement difficulties. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective
as in the United States or other western countries. Furthermore, policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and
expensive, and we may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend patents issued to us or to determine the enforceability, scope
and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation and an adverse determination in any such litigation, if any,
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention, which could harm our business and competitive position.
If we are unable to adequately protect our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, we may lose these rights and our
business may suffer materially. 

42 

Our outstanding long-term loan and other
financing arrangement payable may adversely affect our available cash flow and our ability to operate our business. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our long-term loan payable balances
were 0 and 283, 860 respectively. We also have advances from related parties (Mr. Lirong Wang, Ms. Xueying Sheng and Mr. Guohua Lin)
for working capital of the Company which are due on demand, non-interest bearing, and unsecured. For further information, see Related
Party Transaction s. 

Our outstanding and future loans, combined with
our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have negative consequences on our business and financial condition.
We believe that our cash, cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate
purposes for at least the next 12 months. However, we need to make continued investment for our expansion in facilities and to retain
talents to remain competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us, or
at all, if and when required, especially if we experience disappointing operating results. If adequate capital is not available to us
as required, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our facilities or respond
to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. 

Increases in labor costs in the PRC may
adversely affect our business and our profitability. 

China s economy has experienced increases
in labor costs in recent years. China s overall economy and the average wage in China is expected to continue to grow. The average
wage level for our employees has also increased in recent years. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits,
will continue to increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our customers by increasing prices for our products
or services, our profitability and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

In addition, we have been subject to stricter
regulatory requirements in terms of entering into labor contracts with our employees and paying various statutory employee benefits, including
pensions, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and childbearing insurance to designated
government agencies for the benefit of our employees. Pursuant to the PRC Labor Contract Law, or the Labor Contract Law, that became effective
in January 2008 and its implementing rules that became effective in September 2008 and its amendments that became effective in July 2013,
employers are subject to stricter requirements in terms of signing labor contracts, minimum wages, paying remuneration, determining the
term of employees probation and unilaterally terminating labor contracts. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our
employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules may limit our ability
to effect those changes in a desirable or cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Besides, pursuant to the Labor Contract Law and its amendments, dispatched employees are intended to be a supplementary form of employment
and the fundamental form should be direct employment by enterprises and organizations that require employees. Further, it is expressly
stated in the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch that became effective on March 1, 2014 that the number of seconded employees an employer
uses may not exceed 10 of its total labor force and the employer has a two-year transition period to comply with such requirement. The
VIE and its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated branch offices used seconded employees for their principal business activities.
The transition period ended on February 29, 2016, and those PRC subsidiaries have taken steps to decrease the number of seconded employees.
If the relevant PRC subsidiaries are deemed to have violated the limitation on the use of seconded employees under the relevant labor
laws and regulations, we may be subject to fines and incur other costs to make required changes to our current employment practices. 

As the interpretation and implementation of labor-related
laws and regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our employment practice does not and will not violate labor-related
laws and regulations in China, which may subject us to labor disputes or government investigations. If we are deemed to have violated
relevant labor laws and regulations, we could be required to provide additional compensation to our employees and our business, and our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

43 

We may be liable for improper use or appropriation
of personal information provided by our customers. 

We may become subject to a variety of laws and
regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection. These laws and regulations are continuously
evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting,
particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, there are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection,
sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data. Such laws and regulations often vary
in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. 

We expect to obtain information about various
aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees and third parties. We also maintain information about various aspects of
our operations as well as regarding our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical
to our business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. We are required by applicable
laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate security measures to safeguard such
information. 

The PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment
7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees
from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained during the course of performing duties
or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of
the PRC National People s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June
1, 2017. 

Pursuant to the Cyber Security Law, network operators
must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users personal information necessary
to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products and services and shall comply
with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws and regulations. 

The Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National
People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides main legal basis for privacy and personal information
infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and the Ministry
of Public Security have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection. 

The PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity
are constantly evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry
of Public Security and the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and
interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020.
According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when
purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. 

In November 2016, the Standing Committee of China s
National People s Congress passed China s first Cybersecurity Law CSL ), which became effective in June 2017.
The CSL is the first PRC law that systematically lays out the regulatory requirements on cybersecurity and data protection, subjecting
many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny. The legal consequences of violation of
the CSL include penalties of warning, confiscation of illegal income, suspension of related business, winding up for rectification, shutting
down the websites, and revocation of business license or relevant permits. In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain
other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and
services which do or may affect national security. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of
the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments Draft Measures ), which required that, in addition to operator
of critical information infrastructure, any data processor carrying out data processing activities that affect or
may affect national security should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when
assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities, including, among others, (i) the risk of core data, important data or
a large amount of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited the country; and (ii) the risk of
critical information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being affected, controlled, or
maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad. The Cyberspace Administration of China has said that under the proposed
rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when seeking listings in other nations
because of the risk that such data and personal information could be affected, controlled, and maliciously exploited by foreign
governments, The cybersecurity review will also investigate the potential national security risks from overseas IPOs. We do not
know what regulations will be adopted or how such regulations will affect us and our listing on Nasdaq. In the event that the Cyberspace
Administration of China determines that we are subject to these regulations, we may be required to delist from Nasdaq and we may be subject
to fines and penalties. 

44 

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the
National People s Congress enacted the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The law requires data collection
to be conducted in a legitimate and proper manner, and stipulates that, for the purpose of data protection, data processing activities
must be conducted based on data classification and hierarchical protection system for data security. 

On July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued a document to crack down on illegal activities
in the securities market and promote the high-quality development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant
governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over
Mainland China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities
laws. 

On August 20, 2021, the 30th meeting of the Standing
Committee of the 13th National People s Congress voted and passed the Personal Information Protection Law of the People s
Republic of China , or PRC Personal Information Protection Law , which became effective on November 1, 2021. The PRC
Personal Information Protection Law applies to the processing of personal information of natural persons within the territory of Mainland
China that is carried out outside of Mainland China where (1) such processing is for the purpose of providing products or services for
natural persons within Mainland China, (2) such processing is to analyze or evaluate the behavior of natural persons within Mainland China,
or (3) there are any other circumstances stipulated by related laws and administrative regulations. 

On December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission CSRC ), together with other relevant government authorities in Mainland China issued the Provisions of the State
Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), and the Measures
for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) Draft Overseas Listing Regulations ).
The Draft Overseas Listing Regulations require that a Mainland China domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas Overseas Issuance and Listing shall complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The
Overseas Issuance and Listing includes direct and indirect issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities
are conducted in Mainland China seeks to issue and list its shares in the name of an overseas enterprise Overseas Issuer on the basis of the equity, assets, income or other similar rights and interests of the relevant Mainland China domestic enterprise, such
activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas issuance and listing Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the
Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. 

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial
Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and five supporting
guidelines, which will come into effect on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list
securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC. Since
these statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government are newly published, their interpretation, application and enforcement of
unclear and there also remains significant uncertainty as to the enactment, interpretation and implementation of other regulatory requirements
related to overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities,; our ability to offer, or continue to offer, securities
to investors would be potentially hindered and the value of our securities might significantly decline or be worthless, by existing or
future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry or by intervene or interruption by PRC governmental authorities, if we
or our subsidiaries (i) do not receive or maintain such filings, permissions or approvals required by the PRC government, (ii) inadvertently
conclude that such filings, permissions or approvals are not required, (iii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change
and we are required to obtain such filings, permissions or approvals in the future, or (iv) any intervention or interruption by PRC
governmental with little advance notice. 

In the event that we are subject to any mandatory
cybersecurity review and other specific actions required by the CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities, we face uncertainty as
to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at all. Given such uncertainty, we may be further required
to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

A severe or prolonged downturn in the global
or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. 

The Chinese economy has slowed down since 2012
and such slowdown may continue. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies
adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world s leading economies, including the United States and
China. There have been concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe and Africa, which have resulted in volatility
in oil and other markets, and over the conflicts involving Ukraine and Syria. There have also been concerns on the relationship among
China and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. Economic conditions
in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected
or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, continued turbulence in the international markets
may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure 

If the PRC government deems that the contractual
arrangements in relation to Shanghai Muliang, our consolidated variable interest entity, do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions
on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the
future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. 

The PRC government regulates telecommunications-related
businesses through strict business licensing requirements and other government regulations. These laws and regulations also include limitations
on foreign ownership of PRC companies that engage in telecommunications-related businesses. Specifically, foreign investors are not allowed
to own more than 50 of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunications service provider (except for e-commerce, domestic multi-party
communication, storage and forwarding classes and call centers) under the Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment
(Negative List) (Edition 2020), which was promulgated on June 23, 2020 and implemented on July 23, 2020, and such major foreign investor
in a Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprise must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services, or VATS,
and maintain a good track record in accordance with the Administrative Provisions on Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises (revised
in 2016), and other applicable laws and regulations. 

Muliang Viagoo is a holding company incorporated
in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations in the People s
Republic of China, or PRC or China, though our variable interest entity, Shanghai Muliang and its subsidiaries.
We receive the economic benefits of the VIE s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Investors in our common
shares offered in this offering are purchasing shares of the U.S. holding company and not shares of the VIE and its subsidiaries in China
that are conducting the business operations. For a description of the VIE contractual arrangements, see Corporation History
and Structure-Contractual Arrangements . 

The VIE contributed 93 of the Company s
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the VIE accounted for 99 and 86 of the consolidated total assets
and total liabilities of the Company respectively. 

We rely on and expect to continue to rely on our
wholly owned PRC subsidiary s contractual arrangements with Shanghai Muliang and its shareholders to operate our business. These
contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shanghai Muliang as ownership of controlling equity
interests would be in providing us with control over, or enabling us to derive economic benefits from the operations of Shanghai Muliang.
Under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if Shanghai Muliang or any of its shareholders executing the VIE Agreements
fails to perform its, his or her respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and
resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies available under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or
injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective. For example, if shareholders of a variable interest
entity were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in such variable interest entity to us or our designated persons when we exercise
the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, we may have to take a legal action to compel them to fulfill their contractual
obligations. 

If (i) the applicable PRC authorities invalidate
these contractual arrangements for violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations, (ii) any variable interest entity or its shareholders
terminate the contractual arrangements (iii) any variable interest entity or its shareholders fail to perform its/his/her obligations
under these contractual arrangements, or (iv) if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future, our business
operations in China would be materially and adversely affected, and the value of your shares would substantially decrease or even become
worthless. Further, if we fail to renew these contractual arrangements upon their expiration, we would not be able to continue our business
operations unless the then current PRC law allows us to directly operate businesses in China. 

In addition, if any variable interest entity or
all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our
business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of
the variable interest entities undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its shareholders or unrelated third-party
creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially
and adversely affect our business and our ability to generate revenues. 

All of these contractual arrangements are governed
by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed
as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability
to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to
exert effective control over our operating entities and we may be precluded from operating our business, which would have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

These contractual arrangements may not be as effective
as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIE. For example, the VIE and their shareholders could breach their contractual
arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that
are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of the VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect
changes in the board of directors of the VIE, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations,
at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the VIE and
their shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over the VIE. The shareholders of our consolidated VIE
may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout
the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the contractual arrangements with the VIE. 

46 

If the VIE or their shareholders fail to perform
their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources
to enforce such arrangements. For example, if the shareholders of the VIE refuse to transfer their equity interest in the VIE to us or
our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they otherwise act in bad faith toward
us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. In addition, if any third parties
claim any interest in such shareholders equity interests in the VIE, our ability to exercise shareholders rights or foreclose
the share pledge according to the contractual arrangements may be impaired. If these or other disputes between the shareholders of the
VIE and third parties were to impair our control over the VIE, our ability to consolidate the financial results of the VIE would be affected,
which would in turn result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 

In the opinion our PRC legal counsel, each of
the contractual arrangements among our WFOE, the VIE and its shareholders governed by PRC laws are valid, binding and enforceable, and
will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect. However, our PRC legal counsel has also advised us that
there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules.
Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may ultimately take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. In addition,
it is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted,
what they would provide. PRC government authorities may deem that foreign ownership is directly or indirectly involved in the VIE s
shareholding structure. If our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are deemed by the MIIT or the MOFCOM or other regulators
having competent authority to be illegal, either in whole or in part, we may lose control of our consolidated VIE and have to modify such
structure to comply with regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption
to our VATS business. Furthermore, if we or the VIE is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or
fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion
to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, including, without limitation: 

revoking the business license and/or operating licenses of our WFOE or the VIE; 

discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations through any transactions among our WFOE, the VIE and its subsidiaries; 

imposing fines, confiscating the income from our WFOE, the VIE or its subsidiaries, or imposing other requirements with which we or the VIE may not be able to comply; 

placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues; 

shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites; 

requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements with the VIE and deregistering the equity pledges of the VIE, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate, derive economic interests from, or exert effective control over the VIE; or 

restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds of this offering to finance our business and operations in China. 

taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. 

The imposition of any of these penalties would
result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government
actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements,
if the PRC government authorities were to find our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws and
regulations. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of the VIE or our
right to receive substantially all the economic benefits and residual returns from the VIE and we are not able to restructure our ownership
structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of the VIE in our consolidated
financial statements. Either of these results, or any other significant penalties that might be imposed on us in this event, would have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

47 

We rely on contractual arrangements with
the VIE and their shareholders for a large portion of our business operations. These arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership
in providing operational control. Any failure by the VIE or their shareholders to perform their obligations under such contractual arrangements
would have a material and adverse effect on our business. 

We have relied and expect to continue relying
on contractual arrangements with the VIE and their shareholders to operate our business in China. The revenues contributed by the VIE
and their subsidiaries constituted substantially 93 of our net revenue for the year of 2022. 

These contractual arrangements may not be as effective
as direct ownership in providing us with control over the VIE. For example, the VIE and their shareholders could breach their contractual
arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that
are detrimental to our interests. If we had direct ownership of the VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect
changes in the board of directors of the VIE, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations,
at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by the VIE and
their shareholders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over the VIE. The shareholders of our consolidated VIE
may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout
the period in which we intend to operate certain portions of our business through the contractual arrangements with the VIE. 

If
the VIE or their shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have difficulty
in enforcing any rights the Company may have under the VIE Agreements in PRC and have to incur substantial costs and expend additional
resources to enforce such arrangements. For example, if the shareholders of the VIE refuse to transfer their equity interest in the VIE
to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they otherwise act in bad
faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. In addition, if any
third parties claim any interest in such shareholders equity interests in the VIE, our ability to exercise shareholders 
rights or foreclose the share pledge according to the contractual arrangements may be impaired. If these or other disputes between the
shareholders of the VIE and third parties were to impair our control over the VIE, our ability to consolidate the financial results of
the VIE would be affected, which would in turn result in a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 

Any
failure by Shanghai Muliang, our consolidated variable interest entity, or its shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual
arrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We
refer to the shareholders of the VIE as its nominee shareholders because although they remain the holders of equity interests on record
in the VIE, pursuant to the terms of the relevant power of attorney, such shareholders have irrevocably authorized the individual appointed
by Shanghai Mufeng to exercise their rights as a shareholder of the relevant VIE. If the VIE, or its shareholders fail to perform their
respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to
enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive
relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the shareholders of Shanghai
Muliang were to refuse to transfer their equity interest in Shanghai Muliang to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option
pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions
to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. 

All
the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration
in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance
with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States.
As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. See Risks
Relating to Doing Business in China-Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system and changes in laws and regulations in China could
adversely affect us. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements
in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant
uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration should legal action become necessary. In addition, under PRC laws, rulings
by arbitrators are final and parties cannot appeal arbitration results in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable
by a competent court. If the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties
may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional
expenses and delay. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other
obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our consolidated
variable interest entity, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected.

We
are a holding company and will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs. Any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries
to make dividend payments to us, or any tax implications of making dividend payments to us, could limit our ability to pay our parent
company expenses or pay dividends to holders of our common stock. 

We
are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through Shanghai Muliang, which is a limited liability company established
in China and its subsidiaries. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund our cash and financing requirements,
including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and
to pay our operating expenses. If our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt
may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. 

Under
PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiary, which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, may pay dividends only out of its
accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise
is required to set aside at least 10 of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund,
until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50 of its registered capital. 

Our
PRC subsidiary generates primarily all of its revenue in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result,
any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use its Renminbi revenues to pay dividends to us.
The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put
forward by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current
account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments
to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business,
pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

In
addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10 will be applicable
to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties
or arrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises
are incorporated. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially
and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or
otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

The
shareholders of the VIE may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business
and financial condition. 

As
of the date of this prospectus, we are not aware any conflicts between the shareholders of the VIE and us. However, the shareholders
of the VIE may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us in the future. These shareholders may refuse to sign or breach,
or cause the VIE to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and the VIE, which would have
a material and adverse effect on our ability to effectively control the VIE and receive economic benefits from it. For example, the shareholders
may be able to cause our agreements with the VIE to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments
due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise any or all
of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor, particularly given
the relatively large number of shareholders that Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Zongbao and Shanghai Zongbao Environmental
Construction Co., Ltd., two of the VIE, has. Currently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between
these shareholders and our company. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and these shareholders, we would
have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the
outcome of any such legal proceedings. 

49 

Our
contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law, and any
disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. 

Investors
in our shares of common stock should be aware that they are purchasing equity in Muliang Viagoo Technology Inc., our Nevada holding company,
which does not directly own substantially all of our business in China conducted by the VIE. Although we have been advised by our PRC
legal counsel that our contractual arrangements constitute valid and binding obligations enforceable against each party of such agreements
in accordance with their terms, they may not be as effective in providing control over Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd., our operating
entities, as direct ownership. If the PRC operating entities or the registered shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations
under the contractual arrangements, we may incur substantial costs and expend substantial resources to enforce our rights. All of these
contractual arrangements are governed by and interpreted in accordance with PRC laws, and disputes arising from these contractual arrangements
will be resolved through arbitration or litigation in the PRC. However, the legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions,
such as the United States. There are very few precedents and little official guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context
of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the
outcome of arbitration or litigation. These uncertainties could limit our ability to enforce these Contractual Arrangements. In the event
we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements or we experience significant delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing
these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our affiliated entities and may lose control over
the assets owned by Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. Our financial performance may be adversely and materially affected as a result
and we may not be eligible to consolidate the financial results of the PRC Operating Entities into our financial results. 

Contractual
arrangements in relation to the VIE may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or the VIE owe
additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment. 

Under
applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the
PRC tax authorities within ten years after the taxable year when the transactions are conducted. The PRC enterprise income tax law requires
every enterprise in China to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties
to the relevant tax authorities. The tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related
party transactions that are inconsistent with arm s length principles. We may face material and adverse tax consequences if the
PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements between Shanghai Mufeng, our variable interest entity Shanghai Muliang
and the shareholders of Shanghai Muliang were not entered into on an arm s length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible
reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust Shanghai Muliang income in the form of a transfer pricing
adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Shanghai
Muliang for PRC tax purposes, which could, in turn, increase their tax liabilities without reducing Shanghai Mufeng tax expenses. In
addition, if Shanghai Mufeng requests the Shanghai Muliang Shareholders to transfer their equity interests in Shanghai Muliang at nominal
or no value pursuant to these contractual arrangements, such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject Shanghai Mufeng to PRC income
tax. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on Shanghai Muliang for the adjusted but unpaid
taxes according to the applicable regulations. Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if Shanghai Muliang s
tax liabilities increase or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties. 

We
may lose the ability to use, or otherwise benefit from, the licenses, approvals and assets held by the VIE, which could severely disrupt
our business, render us unable to conduct some or all of our business operations and constrain our growth. 

We
rely on contractual arrangements with the VIE to use, or otherwise benefit from, certain foreign restricted licenses and permits that
we need or may need in the future as our business continues to expand, such as the internet content provider license, or the ICP license
held by Shanghai Muliang, the VIE. 

50 

The
contractual arrangements contain terms that specifically obligate the VIE shareholders to ensure the valid existence of the VIE
and restrict the disposal of material assets of the VIE. However, in the event the VIE shareholders breach the terms of these
contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidate the VIE, or the VIE declare bankruptcy and all or part of their assets become subject
to liens or rights of third-party creditors, or are otherwise disposed of without our consent, we may be unable to conduct some or all
of our business operations or otherwise benefit from the assets held by the VIE, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if the VIE undergo a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, their
shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of the assets of the VIE, thereby hindering our ability
to operate our business as well as constrain our growth. 

If
the custodians or authorized users of our controlling non-tangible assets, including chops and seals, fail to fulfill their responsibilities,
or misappropriate or misuse these assets, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

Under
PRC law, legal documents for corporate transactions, including agreements and contracts that our business relies on, are executed using
the chop or seal of the signing entity or with the signature of a legal representative whose designation is registered and filed with
the relevant local branch of the State Administration for Market Regulation, SMAR formerly known as the State Administration
for Industry and Commerce SAIC ). We generally execute legal documents by affixing chops or seals, rather than having the
designated legal representatives sign the documents. 

We
use two major types of chops: corporate chops and finance chops. Chops are seals or stamps used by a PRC company to legally authorize
documents, often in place of a signature. We use corporate chops generally for documents to be submitted to government agencies, such
as applications for changing business scope, directors or company name, and for legal letters. We use finance chops generally for making
and collecting payments, including issuing invoices. Use of corporate chops must be approved by our legal department and administrative
department, and use of finance chops must be approved by our finance department. The chops of our subsidiary and consolidated VIE are
generally held by the relevant entities so that documents can be executed locally. Although we usually utilize chops to execute contracts,
the registered legal representatives of our subsidiary and consolidated VIE have the apparent authority to enter into contracts on behalf
of such entities without chops, unless such contracts set forth otherwise. 

In
order to maintain the physical security of our chops, we generally have them stored in secured locations accessible only to the designated
key employees of our legal, administrative or finance departments. Our designated legal representatives generally do not have access
to the chops. Although we have approval procedures in place and monitor our key employees, including the designated legal representatives
of our subsidiary and consolidated VIE, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. In addition,
we also separate the authorized user of chops from the keeper of keys to the storage room and install security camera for the storage
room. There is a risk that our key employees or designated legal representatives could abuse their authority, for example, by binding
our subsidiary and consolidated VIE with contracts against our interests, as we would be obligated to honor these contracts if the other
contracting party acts in good faith in reliance on the apparent authority of our chops or signatures of our legal representatives. If
any designated legal representative obtains control of the chop in an effort to obtain control over the relevant entity, we would need
to have a shareholder or board resolution to designate a new legal representative to take legal action to seek the return of the chop,
apply for a new chop with the relevant authorities, or otherwise seek legal remedies for the legal representative s misconduct.
If any of the designated legal representatives obtains and misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or other controlling intangible
assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our normal business operations. We may have to take corporate or legal
action, which could involve significant time and resources to resolve the matter, while distracting management from our operations, and
our business operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

Substantial
uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current
corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. 

The
Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015, or the 2015 FIL Draft, which
expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of actual control in determining whether a company
is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. Under the 2015 FIL Draft, VIE that are controlled via contractual arrangement
would also be deemed as foreign invested enterprises, if they are ultimately controlled by foreign investors. 

51 

On
March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the FIL, which will come into
effect on January 1, 2020, repealing simultaneously the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the PRC on Wholly
Foreign-owned Enterprises and the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures, together with their implementation rules
and ancillary regulations. Pursuant to the FIL, foreign investment refers to any investment activity directly or indirectly carried out
by foreign natural persons, enterprises, or other organizations, including investment in new construction project, establishment of foreign
funded enterprise or increase of investment, merger and acquisition, and investment in any other way stipulated under laws, administrative
regulations, or provisions of the State Council. Although the FIL has deleted the particular reference to the concept of actual
control and contractual arrangements compared to the 2015 FIL Draft, there is still uncertainty regarding whether the VIE would
be identified as a FIE in the future. 

Even
if the VIE were to be identified as a FIE in the future, we believe that our current business would not be adversely affected. However,
if we were to engage in any business conduct involving third parties identified as prohibited or restricted on the Negative List, the
VIE as well as its subsidiary may be subject to laws and regulations on foreign investment. In addition, our shareholders would also
be prohibited or restricted to invest in certain sectors on the Negative List. However, even if the VIE were to be identified as a FIE,
the validity of our contractual arrangements with Shanghai Muliang and its shareholders as well as our corporate structure would not
be adversely affected. We would still be able to receive benefits from the VIE in accordance with the contractual agreements. In addition,
as the Chinese government has been updating the Negative List in recent years and reducing the sectors prohibited or restricted for foreign
investment, it is probable in the future that, even if the VIE is identified as a FIE, it is still allowed to acquire or hold equity
of enterprises in sectors currently prohibited or restricted for foreign investment. 

Furthermore,
the PRC Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign
investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the PRC Foreign Investment
Law. 

In
addition, the PRC Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments
in the PRC, including, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency,
its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or
compensation lawfully acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments
to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment
in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs,
set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except
for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in
a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer
is prohibited. 

Notwithstanding
the above, the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes foreign investors invest through any other
methods under laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council . Therefore, there are possibilities
that future laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may regard contractual arrangements as a form
of foreign investment, and then whether our contractual arrangement will be recognized as foreign investment, whether our contractual
arrangement will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access requirements and how the above-mentioned contractual arrangement
will be handled are uncertain. 

52 

The
Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities . We are currently
not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if the VIE or the holding company were required
to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to
continue listing on U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. 

The
Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those
relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these
jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures
and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future,
including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional
or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular
regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties. 

For
example, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2 that it had begun an investigation of Didi Global Inc. (NYSE: DIDI)
and two days later ordered that the company s app be removed from smartphone app stores. 

As
such, the Company s business segments may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which
they operate. The Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal
agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws
and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time
with little advance notice, which could result in a material change in our operations and in the value of our common stock. Any actions
by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in
China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors
and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. 

Furthermore,
it is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges
in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not
required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial
to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations
relating to its business or industry. As a result, our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless should
we become subject to new requirement to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchange in the future. 

Recently,
the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued
the Opinions on Severe and Lawful Crackdown on Illegal Securities Activities, which was available to the public on July 6, 2021. These
opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings
by China-based companies. These opinions proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory
systems, to deal with the risks and incidents facing China-based overseas-listed companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data
privacy protection. Moreover, the State Internet Information Office issued the Measures of Cybersecurity Review (Revised Draft for Comments,
not yet effective) on July 10, 2021, which requires operators with personal information of more than 1 million users who want to list
abroad to file a cybersecurity review with the Office of Cybersecurity Review. The aforementioned policies and any related implementation
rules to be enacted may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future. While we believe that our operations are not affected
by this, as these opinions were recently issued, official guidance and interpretation of the opinions remain unclear in several respects
at this time. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will remain fully compliant with all new regulatory requirements of these opinions
or any future implementation rules on a timely basis, or at all. 

53 

Certain
judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable. 

We
conduct most of our operations in China and substantially all of our operations outside of the United States. Most of our assets are
located in China, and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, all our senior executive
officers reside within China for a significant portion of the time and most are PRC nationals. Substantially all of the assets of these
persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or
against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal
securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the U.S. and of China may render
you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. 

Substantial
uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation and implementation of PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability
of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. 

On
March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced
three existing laws on foreign investments in China, namely, the PRC Equity Joint Venture Law, the PRC Cooperative Joint Venture Law
and the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment
Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international
practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic invested enterprises in
China. The Foreign Investment Law establishes the basic framework for the access to, and the promotion, protection and administration
of foreign investments in view of investment protection and fair competition. 

According
to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investment refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by one
or more natural persons, business entities, or otherwise organizations of a foreign country (collectively referred to as foreign
investor within China, and the investment activities include the following situations: (i) a foreign investor, individually or
collectively with other investors, establishes a foreign-invested enterprise within China; (ii) a foreign investor acquires stock shares,
equity shares, shares in assets, or other like rights and interests of an enterprise within China; (iii) a foreign investor, individually
or collectively with other investors, invests in a new project within China; and (iv) investments in other means as provided by laws,
administrative regulations, or the State Council. 

According
to the Foreign Investment Law, the State Council will publish or approve to publish the negative list for special administrative
measures concerning foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, or FIEs, except
for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either restricted or prohibited in the negative
list . Because the negative list has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current Special
Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List). The Foreign Investment Law provides that FIEs operating
in foreign restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC governmental
authorities. If a foreign investor is found to invest in any prohibited industry in the negative list , such foreign investor
may be required to, among other aspects, cease its investment activities, dispose of its equity interests or assets within a prescribed
time limit and have its income confiscated. If the investment activity of a foreign investor is in breach of any special administrative
measure for restrictive access provided for in the negative list , the relevant competent department shall order the foreign
investor to make corrections and take necessary measures to meet the requirements of the special administrative measure for restrictive
access. 

The
 variable interest entity structure, or VIE structure, has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain
necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. Under the Foreign
Investment Law, variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are
ultimately controlled by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that
is included in the negative list as restricted industry, the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate
controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s)
is/are of foreign nationalities, then the variable interest entities will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the industry category
on the negative list without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal. 

54 

The
PRC government will establish a foreign investment information reporting system, according to which foreign investors or foreign-invested
enterprises shall submit investment information to the competent department for commerce concerned through the enterprise registration
system and the enterprise credit information publicity system, and a security review system under which the security review shall be
conducted for foreign investment affecting or likely affecting the state security. 

Furthermore,
the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment
may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the Foreign Investment Law. 

In
addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments
in the PRC, including, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency,
its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or
compensation lawfully acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments
to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment
in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs,
set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except
for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in
a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer
is prohibited. 

Notwithstanding
the above, the Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes foreign investors invest through any other methods
under laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council . Therefore, there are possibilities that
future laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may regard contractual arrangements as a form of
foreign investment, and then whether our contractual arrangement will be recognized as foreign investment, whether our contractual arrangement
will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access requirements and how the above-mentioned contractual arrangement will
be handled are uncertain. 

The
Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities . We are currently
not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if the VIE or the holding company were required
to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to
continue listing on U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. 

The
Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those
relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these
jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures
and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future,
including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional
or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular
regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties. 

55 

For
example, the Chinese cybersecurity regulator announced on July 2 that it had begun an investigation of Didi Global Inc. (NYSE: DIDI)
and two days later ordered that the company s app be removed from smartphone app stores. 

Additionally,
on July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council
jointly issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, or the Opinions, which emphasized the need to
strengthen administration over illegal securities activities and supervision of overseas listings by China-based companies. The Opinions
proposed promoting regulatory systems to deal with risks facing China-based overseas-listed companies, and provided that the State Council
will revise provisions regarding the overseas issuance and listing of shares by companies limited by shares and will clarify the duties
of domestic regulatory authorities. However, the Opinions did not provide detailed rules and regulations. As a result, uncertainties
remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Opinions. 

As
such, the Company s business segments may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which
they operate. The Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal
agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws
and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. 

Furthermore,
it is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges
in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not
required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial
to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations
relating to its business or industry. 

Risks
Relating to this Offering 

Our
common stock has a limited public trading market. 

There
is a limited established public trading marketing for our common stock, and there can be no assurance that one will ever develop. Market
liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness
of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to
liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our securities
may not find purchasers for our securities should they to sell securities held by them. Consequently, our securities should be purchased
only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time. 

We
are not likely to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We
currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect
to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. 

Our
common stock may be subject now and in the future to the SEC s Penny Stock . 

We
may be subject now and in the future to the SEC s penny stock rules if our shares of common stock sell below 5.00
per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers
to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and
level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for
the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson and monthly account statements showing the market value of
each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation
information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer
in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. 

56 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction; the broker dealer must make a special written determination that
the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. The
penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our common stock.
As long as our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of common stock may find it more
difficult to sell their securities. 

The
offering price for our shares of common stock may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market and such market
prices may be volatile. 

The
offering price for our shares of common stock will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriter and does not bear any
relationship to our earnings, book value or any other indicia of value. We cannot assure you that the market price of our shares of common
stock will not decline significantly below the offering price. The financial markets in the United States and other countries have experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations in the last few years. Volatility in the price of our shares of common stock may be caused
by factors outside of our control and may be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our results of operations. 

You
will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock purchased. 

The
offering price of our shares of common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock.
Consequently, when you purchase our shares of common stock in the offering and upon completion of the offering, you will incur immediate
dilution of US 3.00 per share, based on an assumed offering price of US 4.00 per share. In addition, you may experience further dilution
to the extent that additional shares of common stock are issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options we may grant from time
to time. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We
currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare
or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our shares of common
stock if the market price of our shares of common stock increases. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish a negative report regarding
our shares of common stock, the price of our shares of common stock and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our shares of common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish
about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade us, the
price of our shares of common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly
publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price of our shares of common stock and
the trading volume to decline. 

The
market price of our shares of common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be
able to resell your shares at or above the offering price. 

The
offering price for our shares of common stock will be determined through negotiations between the underwriter and us and may vary from
the market price of our shares of common stock following our offering. If you purchase our shares of common stock in this offering, you
may not be able to resell those shares at or above the offering price. The market price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate significantly
in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

actual
or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results; 

the
financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; 

actions
of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow
our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; 

57 

announcements
by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures
or capital commitments; 

price
and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; 

lawsuits
threatened or filed against us; and 

other
events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events. 

In
addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market
prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods
of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources
and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business. 

Our
management has broad discretion to determine how to use the funds raised in the offering and may use them in ways that may not enhance
our results of operations or the price of our shares of common stock. 

We
anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other corporate purposes. Our management will
have significant discretion as to the use of the net proceeds to us from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not
improve our results of operations or enhance the market price of our shares of common stock. 

Nasdaq
may apply additional and more stringent criteria for our initial and continued listing because we plan to have a small public offering
and insiders will hold a large portion of the company s listed securities. 

Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5101 provides Nasdaq with broad discretionary authority over the initial and continued listing of securities in Nasdaq and
Nasdaq may use such discretion to deny initial listing, apply additional or more stringent criteria for the initial or continued listing
of particular securities, or suspend or delist particular securities based on any event, condition, or circumstance that exists or occurs
that makes initial or continued listing of the securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted in the opinion of Nasdaq, even though
the securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial or continued listing on Nasdaq. In addition, Nasdaq has used its discretion to
deny initial or continued listing or to apply additional and more stringent criteria in the instances, including but not limited to:
(i) where the company engaged an auditor that has not been subject to an inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB ), an auditor that PCAOB cannot inspect, or an auditor that has not demonstrated sufficient resources, geographic
reach, or experience to adequately perform the company s audit; (ii) where the company planned a small public offering, which would
result in insiders holding a large portion of the company s listed securities. Nasdaq was concerned that the offering size was
insufficient to establish the company s initial valuation, and there would not be sufficient liquidity to support a public market
for the company; and (iii) where the company did not demonstrate sufficient nexus to the U.S. capital market, including having no U.S.
shareholders, operations, or members of the board of directors or management. Our public offering will be relatively small and the insiders
of our Company will hold a large portion of the company s listed securities. Nasdaq might apply the additional and more stringent
criteria for our initial and continued listing, which might cause delay or even denial of our listing application.

Regulations
on Intellectual Property Rights 

Regulations
on Copyright 

The
 Copyright Law of the PRC , or the Copyright Law , which took effect on June 1, 1991 and was amended in 2001, 2010 and 2020
(the current effective revision became effective on April 1, 2010 while the latest revision has not yet come into effect until June 1,
2021), provides that Chinese citizens, legal persons, or other organizations shall, whether published or not, own copyright in their
copyrightable works, which include, among others, works of literature, art, natural science, social science, engineering technology and
computer software. Copyright owners enjoy certain legal rights, including right of publication, right of authorship and right of reproduction.
The Copyright Law as revised in 2001 extends copyright protection to Internet activities and products disseminated over the Internet.
In addition, PRC laws and regulations provide for a voluntary registration system administered by the Copyright Protection Center of
China, or the CPCC. According to the Copyright Law , an infringer of the copyrights shall be subject to various civil liabilities,
which include ceasing infringement activities, apologizing to the copyright owners and compensating the loss of copyright owner. Infringers
of copyright may also subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities in severe situations. 

The
 Computer Software Copyright Registration Measures , or the Software Copyright Measures , promulgated by the National Copyright
Administration, or the NCA on April 6, 1992 and latest amended on February 20, 2002, regulates registrations of software copyright, exclusive
licensing contracts for software copyright and assignment agreements. The NCA administers software copyright registration and the CPCC,
is designated as the software registration authority. The CPCC shall grant registration certificates to the Computer Software Copyrights
applicants which meet the requirements of both the Software Copyright Measures and the Computer Software Protection Regulations
 (Revised in 2013). 

The
 Provisions of the Supreme People s Court on Certain Issues Related to the Application of Law in the Trial of Civil Cases Involving
Disputes on Infringement of the Information Network Dissemination Rights specifies that disseminating works, performances or audio-video
products by the internet users or the internet service providers via the internet without the permission of the copyright owners shall
be deemed to have infringed the right of dissemination of the copyright owner. 

The
 Measures for Administrative Protection of Copyright Related to Internet , which was jointly promulgated by the NCA and the MII
on April 29, 2005 and became effective on May 30, 2005, provides that upon receipt of an infringement notice from a legitimate copyright
holder, an ICP operator must take remedial actions immediately by removing or disabling access to the infringing content. If an ICP operator
knowingly transmits infringing content or fails to take remedial actions after receipt of a notice of infringement that harms public
interest, the ICP operator could be subject to administrative penalties, including an order to cease infringing activities, confiscation
by the authorities of all income derived from the infringement activities, or payment of fines. 

On
May 18, 2006, the State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of the Right to Network Dissemination of Information
 (as amended in 2013). Under these regulations, an owner of the network dissemination rights with respect to written works, performance
or audio or video recordings who believes that information storage, search or link services provided by an Internet service provider

Patent
Law 

According
to the Patent Law of the PRC (Revised in 2008), the State Intellectual Property Office is responsible for administering patent
law in the PRC. The patent administration departments of provincial, autonomous region or municipal governments are responsible for administering
patent law within their respective jurisdictions. The Chinese patent system adopts a first-to-file principle, which means that when more
than one person file different patent applications for the same invention, only the person who files the application first is entitled
to obtain a patent of the invention. To be patentable, an invention or a utility model must meet three criteria: novelty, inventiveness
and practicability. A patent is valid for twenty years in the case of an invention and ten years in the case of utility models and designs. 

Trademark
Law 

Trademarks
are protected by the Trademark Law of the PRC which was adopted in 1982 and subsequently amended in 1993, 2001, 2013 and 2019
respectively as well as by the Implementation Regulations of the PRC Trademark Law adopted by the State Council in 2002 and as
most recently amended on April 29, 2014. The Trademark Office of the State Administration for Market Regulation of the PRC handles trademark
registrations. The Trademark Office grants a ten-year term to registered trademarks and the term may be renewed for another ten-year
period upon request by the trademark owner. A trademark registrant may license its registered trademarks to another party by entering
into trademark license agreements, which must be filed with the Trademark Office for its record. As with patents, the Trademark Law has
adopted a first-to-file principle with respect to trademark registration. If a trademark applied for is identical or similar to another
trademark which has already been registered or subject to a preliminary examination and approval for use on the same or similar kinds
of products or services, such trademark application may be rejected. Any person applying for the registration of a trademark may not
injure existing trademark rights first obtained by others, nor may any person register in advance a trademark that has already been used
by another party and has already gained a sufficient degree of reputation through such party s use. 

Regulations
on Domain Names 

The
MIIT promulgated the Measures on Administration of Internet Domain Names , or the Domain Name Measures on August 24, 2017,
which took effect on November 1, 2017 and replaced the Administrative Measures on China Internet Domain Names promulgated by MII
on November 5, 2004. According to the Domain Name Measures , the MIIT is in charge of the administration of PRC internet domain
names. The domain name registration follows a first-to-file principle. Applicants for registration of domain names shall provide the
true, accurate and complete information of their identities to domain name registration service institutions. The applicants will become
the holder of such domain names upon the completion of the registration procedure. 

Corporate
Laws and Industry Catalogue Relating to Foreign Investment 

The
establishment, operation and management of companies in China are mainly governed by the PRC Company Law, as most recently amended in
2018, which applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested companies. On March 15, 2019, the National People s Congress
approved the Foreign Investment Law, and on December 26, 2019, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Rules of the PRC Foreign
Investment Law, or the Implementing Rules, to further clarify and elaborate the relevant provisions of the Foreign Investment Law. The
Foreign Investment Law and the Implementing Rules both took effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced three major previous laws on foreign
investments in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and the Wholly
Foreign-owned Enterprise Law, together with their respective implementing rules. Pursuant to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign
investments refer to investment activities conducted by foreign investors (including foreign natural persons, foreign enterprises
or other foreign organizations) directly or indirectly in the PRC, which include any of the following circumstances: (i) foreign investors
setting up foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC solely or jointly with other investors, (ii) foreign investors obtaining shares, equity
interests, property portions or other similar rights and interests of enterprises within the PRC, (iii) foreign investors investing in
new projects in the PRC solely or jointly with other investors, and (iv) investment in other methods as specified in laws, administrative
regulations, or as stipulated by the State Council. The Implementing Rules introduce a see-through principle and further provide that
foreign-invested enterprises that invest in the PRC shall also be governed by the Foreign Investment Law and the Implementing Rules. 

61 

The
Foreign Investment Law and the Implementing Rules provide that a system of pre-entry national treatment and negative list shall be applied
for the administration of foreign investment, where pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign
investors and their investments at market access stage is no less favorable than that given to domestic investors and their investments,
and negative list means the special administrative measures for foreign investment s access to specific fields or
industries, which will be proposed by the competent investment department of the State Council in conjunction with the competent commerce
department of the State Council and other relevant departments, and be reported to the State Council for promulgation, or be promulgated
by the competent investment department or competent commerce department of the State Council after being reported to the State Council
for approval. Foreign investment beyond the negative list will be granted national treatment. Foreign investors shall not invest in the
prohibited fields as specified in the negative list, and foreign investors who invest in the restricted fields shall comply with the
special requirements on the shareholding, senior management personnel, etc. In the meantime, relevant competent government departments
will formulate a catalogue of industries for which foreign investments are encouraged according to the needs for national economic and
social development, to list the specific industries, fields and regions in which foreign investors are encouraged and guided to invest.
The current industry entry clearance requirements governing investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are set out in two
categories, namely the Special Entry Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment (2020 version), or the
2020 Negative List, promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, on June
24, 2020 and took effect on July 23, 2020, and the Encouraged Industry Catalogue for Foreign Investment (2020 version), or the 2020 Encouraged
Industry Catalogue, promulgated by the MOFCOM on December 27, 2020 and took effect on January 27, 2021. Industries not listed in these
two categories are generally deemed permitted for foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC laws.
The flat panel display industry is not on the Negative List and therefore we are not subject to any restriction or limitation on foreign
ownership. 

According
to the Implementing Rules, the registration of foreign-invested enterprises shall be handled by the SAMR or its authorized local counterparts.
Where a foreign investor invests in an industry or field subject to licensing in accordance with laws, the relevant competent government
department responsible for granting such license shall review the license application of the foreign investor in accordance with the
same conditions and procedures applicable to PRC domestic investors unless it is stipulated otherwise by the laws and administrative
regulations, and the competent government department shall not impose discriminatory requirements on the foreign investor in terms of
licensing conditions, application materials, reviewing steps and deadlines, etc. However, the relevant competent government departments
shall not grant the license or permit enterprise registration if the foreign investor intends to invest in the industries or fields as
specified in the negative list without satisfying the relevant requirements. In the event that a foreign investor invests in a prohibited
field or industry as specified in the negative list, the relevant competent government department shall order the foreign investor to
stop the investment activities, dispose of the shares or assets or take other necessary measures within a specified time limit, and restore
to the status prior to the occurrence of the aforesaid investment, and the illegal gains, if any, shall be confiscated. If the investment
activities of a foreign investor violate the special administration measures for access restrictions on foreign investments as stipulated
in the negative list, the relevant competent government department shall order the investor to make corrections within the specified
time limit and take necessary measures to meet the relevant requirements. If the foreign investor fails to make corrections within the
specified time limit, the aforesaid provisions regarding the circumstance that a foreign investor invests in the prohibited field or
industry shall apply. 

Pursuant
to the Foreign Investment Law and the Implementing Rules, and the Information Reporting Measures for Foreign Investment jointly promulgated
by the MOFCOM and the SAMR, which took effect on January 1, 2020, a foreign investment information reporting system shall be established
and foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall report investment information to competent commerce departments of the government
through the enterprise registration system and the enterprise credit information publicity system, and the administration for market
regulation shall forward the above investment information to the competent commerce departments in a timely manner. In addition, the
MOFCOM shall set up a foreign investment information reporting system to receive and handle the investment information and inter-departmentally
shared information forwarded by the administration for market regulation in a timely manner. The foreign investors or foreign-invested
enterprises shall report the investment information by submitting reports including initial reports, change reports, deregistration reports
and annual reports. 

62 

Furthermore,
the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested enterprises established according to the previous laws regulating foreign investment
prior to the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after
the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. The Implementing Rules further clarify that such foreign-invested enterprises established
prior to the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law may either adjust their organizational forms or organizational structures pursuant
to the Company Law or the Partnership Law, or maintain their current structure and corporate governance within five years upon the implementation
of the Foreign Investment Law. Since January 1, 2025, if a foreign-invested enterprise fails to adjust its organizational form or organizational
structure in accordance with the laws and go through the applicable registrations for changes, the relevant administration for market
regulation shall not handle other registrations for such foreign-invested enterprise and shall publicize the relevant circumstances.
However, after the organizational forms or organizational structures of a foreign-invested enterprise have been adjusted, the original
parties to the Sino-foreign equity or cooperative joint ventures may continue to process such matters as the equity interest transfer,
the distribution of income or surplus assets as agreed by the parties in the relevant contracts. 

In
addition, the Foreign Investment Law and the Implementing Rules also specify other protective rules and principles for foreign investors
and their investments in the PRC, including, among others, that local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors;
except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be
made in a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; mandatory technology transfer
is prohibited, etc. 

Shanghai
Mufeng, our wholly foreign owned subsidiary, as a foreign invested entity, and Muliang HK, as a foreign investor, are required to comply
with the information reporting requirements under the Foreign Investment Law the Implementing Rules and the Information Reporting Measures
for Foreign Investment and are in full compliance. 

Regulations
Relating to Taxation 

PRC 

In
January 2008, the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (The EIT Law) took effect. The EIT applies a uniform 25 enterprise income
tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, unless where tax incentives are granted to special industries
and projects. Under the EIT Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January
1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10 if the PRC tax authorities determine that
the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding
tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC withholding tax. 

Under
the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident
enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate on its
worldwide income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain
Chinese-invested enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as resident
enterprises clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC resident enterprises will be considered PRC-source
income and subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10 , when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also
subjects such PRC resident enterprises to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. 

63 

Under
the implementation regulations to the EIT Law, a de facto management body is defined as a body that has material and overall
management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise.
In addition, the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC-invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise
or a Chinese enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or residence in
the PRC: senior management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and
personnel decision making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal and minutes of board meetings and shareholders 
meetings; and half or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights.

individual is a tax resident in Singapore in a year of assessment if, in the preceding year, he was physically present in Singapore or
exercised an employment in Singapore (other than as a director of a company) for 183 days or more, or if he resides in Singapore. 

Individual
taxpayers who are Singapore tax residents are subject to Singapore income tax on income accruing in or derived from Singapore. All foreign-sourced
income received in Singapore on or after January 1, 2004 by a Singapore tax resident individual (except for income received through a
partnership in Singapore) is exempt from Singapore income tax if the Comptroller of Income Tax in Singapore Comptroller is satisfied that the tax exemption would be beneficial to the individual. A Singapore tax resident individual is taxed at progressive
rates ranging from 0 to 22 . 

Non-resident
individuals, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, are subject to Singapore income tax on income accruing in or derived from
Singapore at the rate of 22 . 

Corporate
Income Tax 

A
corporate taxpayer is regarded as resident in Singapore for Singapore tax purposes if the control and management of its business is exercised
in Singapore. 

Corporate
taxpayers who are Singapore tax residents are subject to Singapore income tax on income accruing in or derived from Singapore and, subject
to certain exceptions, on foreign-sourced income received or deemed to be received in Singapore. Foreign-sourced income in the form of
dividends, branch profits and service income received or deemed to be received in Singapore by Singapore tax resident companies on or
after June 1, 2003 are exempt from tax if certain prescribed conditions are met, including the following: 

(i) such
income is subject to tax of a similar character to income tax under the law of the jurisdiction from which such income is received; and 

(ii) at
the time the income is received in Singapore, the highest rate of tax of a similar character to income tax (by whatever name called)
levied under the law of the territory from which the income is received on any gains or profits from any trade or business carried on
by any company in that territory at that time is not less than 15 . 

Certain
concessions and clarifications have also been announced by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore IRAS with respect
to such conditions. 

A
non-resident corporate taxpayer is subject to income tax on income that is accrued in or derived from Singapore, and on foreign-sourced
income received or deemed received in Singapore, subject to certain exceptions. 

The
corporate tax rate in Singapore is currently 17 . In addition, three-quarters of up to the first S 10,000 of a company s annual
normal chargeable income, and one-half of up to the next S 190,000, is exempt from corporate tax from the year of assessment YA 2020 onwards. The remaining chargeable income (after the tax exemption) will be fully taxable at the prevailing corporate tax rate. 

64 

New
companies will also, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, be eligible for tax exemption on three-quarters of up to the first
S 100,000 of a company s annual normal chargeable income, and one-half of up to the next S 100,000, a year for each of the company s
first three YAs from YA 2020 onwards. The remaining chargeable income (after the tax exemption) will be taxed at the applicable corporate
tax rate. 

Regulations
Relating to Foreign Exchange 

Pursuant
to the Regulations on the Administration of Foreign Exchange issued by the State Council and effective in 1996, as amended in January
1997 and August 2008, current account transactions, such as sale or purchase of goods, are not subject to PRC governmental control or
restrictions. Certain organizations in the PRC, including foreign-invested enterprises, may purchase, sell, and/or remit foreign currencies
at certain banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business upon providing valid commercial documents. Approval of the PRC State
Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE ), however, is required for capital account transactions. 

In
August 2008, SAFE issued a circular on the conversion of foreign currency into Renminbi by a foreign-invested company that regulates
how the converted Renminbi may be used. The circular requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise converted
into Renminbi from foreign currencies may only be utilized for purposes within its business scope. For example, such converted amounts
may not be used for investments in or acquisitions of other PRC companies, unless specifically provided otherwise, which can inhibit
the ability of companies to consummate such transactions. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi
registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises converted from foreign currencies. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed
without SAFE s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been utilized.
Violations may result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines. 

Regulations
Relating to Labor 

Pursuant
to the PRC Labor Law effective in 1995 and the PRC Labor Contract Law effective in 2008, a written labor contract is required when an
employment relationship is established between an employer and an employee. Other labor-related regulations and rules of the PRC stipulate
the maximum number of working hours per day and per week as well as the minimum wages. An employer is required to set up occupational
safety and sanitation systems, implement the national occupational safety and sanitation rules and standards, educate employees on occupational
safety and sanitation, prevent accidents at work and reduce occupational hazards. 

In
the PRC, workers dispatched by an employment agency are normally engaged in temporary, auxiliary or substitute work. Pursuant to the
PRC Labor Contract Law, an employment agency is the employer for workers dispatched by it, and it must perform an employer s obligations
toward them. The employment contract between the employment agency and the dispatched workers, and the placement agreement between the
employment agency and the company that receives the dispatched workers must be in writing. Also, the company that accepts the dispatched
workers must bear joint and several liabilities for any violation of the Labor Contract Law by the employment agencies arising from their
contracts with dispatched workers. An employer is obligated to sign an indefinite term labor contract with an employee if the employer
continues to employ the employee after two consecutive fixed-term labor contracts. The employer also has to pay compensation to the employee
if the employer terminates an indefinite term labor contract. Except where the employer proposes to renew a labor contract by maintaining
or raising the conditions of the labor contract and the employee is not agreeable to the renewal, an employer is required to compensate
the employee when a definite term labor contract expires. Furthermore, under the Regulations on Paid Annual Leave for Employees issued
by the State Council in December 2007 and effective as of January 2008, employees who have served an employer for more than one (1) year
and less than ten years are entitled to a 5-day paid vacation, those whose service period ranges from 10 to 20 years are entitled to
a 10-day paid vacation, and those who have served for more than 20 years are entitled to a 15-day paid vacation. An employee who does
not use such vacation time at the request of the employer shall be compensated at three times their normal salaries for each waived vacation
day. 

65 

Pursuant
to the Regulations on Occupational Injury Insurance effective in 2004 and the Interim Measures concerning the Maternity Insurance for
Enterprise Employees effective in 1995, PRC companies must pay occupational injury insurance premiums and maternity insurance premiums
for their employees. Pursuant to the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums effective in 1999
and the Interim Measures concerning the Administration of the Registration of Social Insurance effective in 1999, basic pension insurance,
medical insurance, and unemployment insurance are collectively referred to as social insurance. Both PRC companies and their employees
are required to contribute to the social insurance plans. Pursuant to the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Fund effective
in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing fund management centers and establish a special housing
fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees are required to contribute to the housing funds. 

Regulations
on Dividend Distribution 

Wholly
foreign-owned companies in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits after tax as determined in accordance with
PRC accounting standards. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise out of China is subject to examination by the
banks designated by SAFE. Wholly foreign-owned companies may not pay dividends unless they set aside at least 10 of their respective
accumulated profits after tax each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such time as the accumulative amount of such fund
reaches 50 of the wholly foreign-owned company s registered capital. In addition, these companies also may allocate a portion
of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserve funds
and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. 

Safe
Regulations on Offshore Special Purpose Companies Held by PRC Residents or Citizens 

Pursuant
to the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Inbound Investment
via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular No. 75, issued in October 2005 by SAFE and its supplemental notices, PRC citizens
or residents are required to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore
entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving a roundtrip investment whereby the offshore entity acquires
or controls onshore assets or equity interests held by the PRC citizens or residents. In addition, such PRC citizens or residents must
update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to increases or decreases
in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, mergers or divisions, long-term equity or debt investments, external guarantees
or other material events that do not involve roundtrip investments. Subsequent regulations further clarified that PRC subsidiaries of
an offshore company governed by the SAFE regulations are required to coordinate and supervise the filing of SAFE registrations in a timely
manner by the offshore holding company s shareholders who are PRC citizens or residents. If these shareholders fail to comply,
the PRC subsidiaries are required to report to the local SAFE branches. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC
citizens or residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing
their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company
may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE
registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange
restrictions. 

66 

SAFE
Regulations on Employee Share Options 

On
March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating
in Employee Share Holding Plan or Share Option Plan of Overseas Listed Company, or the Share Option Rule. Pursuant to the Share Option
Rule, Chinese citizens who are granted share options by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE through
a Chinese agent or Chinese subsidiary of the overseas publicly listed company and complete certain other procedures. Our PRC employees
who have been granted share options will be subject to these regulations. Failure of our PRC share option holders to complete their SAFE
registrations may subject these PRC employees to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital
into our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to us. 

Cybersecurity 

The
PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment 7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits
institutions, companies and their employees from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained
in performing duties or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the
Standing Committee of the PRC National People s Congress, or the SCNPC, issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security
Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. 

Pursuant
to the Cyber Security Law, network operators must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only
collect users personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance
for their products and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under
the relevant laws and regulations. 

The
Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides
legal basis for privacy and personal information infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace
Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly
focused on regulation in data security and data protection. 

PRC
regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity are evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace
Administration of China, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation, have enforced data privacy
and protection laws and regulations with varying and evolving standards and interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated
Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical
information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national
security. 

In
July 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China and other related authorities released the draft amendment to the Cybersecurity Review
Measures for public comments through July 25, 2021. The draft amendment proposes the following key changes: 

companies
who are engaged in data processing are also subject to the regulatory scope; 

the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, is included as one of the regulatory authorities for purposes of jointly establishing
the state cybersecurity review working mechanism; 

the
operators (including both operators of critical information infrastructure and relevant parties who are engaged in data processing) holding
more than one million users/users (which to be further specified) individual information and seeking a listing outside China shall
file for cybersecurity review with the Cybersecurity Review Office; and 

the
risks of core data, material data or large amounts of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, damaged, illegally used or
transmitted to overseas parties and the risks of critical information infrastructure, core data, material data or large amounts of personal
information being influenced, controlled or used maliciously shall be collectively taken into consideration during the cybersecurity
review process. 

67 

If
the draft amendment is adopted into law in the future, we may become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review. In addition, certain internet
platforms in China have been reportedly subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in relation to cybersecurity matters. As of the date
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that we file for a
cybersecurity review. However, we are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator or a company that is engaged in data
processing and holds personal information of more than one million users, we could be subject to PRC cybersecurity review. 

As
there remains significant uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we could
be subject to cybersecurity review, and if so, we may not be able to pass such review. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced
cybersecurity review or investigations launched by PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity
review procedures or any other non-compliance with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including
suspension of business, website closure, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings
or actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

On
June 10, 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which became effective in September 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes
data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities. It introduces a data classification and
hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development. The degree of harm it will cause to
national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with,
destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides a national security review procedure for data
activities that may affect national security and impose export restrictions on certain data and information. On August 20, 2021, the
SCNPC adopted the Personal Information Property Law, which shall come into force as of November 1, 2021. The Personal Information Protection
Law includes the basic rules for personal information processing, the rules for cross-border provision of personal information, the rights
of individuals in personal information processing activities, the obligations of personal information processors, and the legal responsibilities
for illegal collection, processing, and use of personal information. 

As
uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we can
comply with such regulations in all respects and we may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory
authorities. We may also become subject to fines and/or other sanctions which may have material adverse effect on our business, operations
and financial condition. 

While
we take various measures to comply with all applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, our current security measures
and those of our third-party service providers may not always be adequate for the protection of our company, employee or third party
data. We may be a target for computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists in the future. 

Unauthorized
access to our proprietary internal and third party data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by
an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the
networks of our third party service providers, or other misconduct. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt
to penetrate and sabotage our proprietary internal and third party data change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against
a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. 

Unauthorized
access to our proprietary internal and third party data may also be obtained through inadequate use of security controls. Any of such
incidents may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to negative
publicity about our security and privacy policies, systems, or measurements. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches, cyber-attacks
or other unauthorized access to our systems or disclosure of third party data, including their personal information, could result in
loss or misuse of such data, interruptions to our service system, loss of confidence and trust in our company, impairment of our technology
infrastructure, and harm our reputation and business, resulting in significant legal and financial exposure and potential lawsuits. 

68 

Permission
Required from PRC Authorities 

We
and our PRC subsidiaries currently have received all material permissions and approvals required for our operations in compliance with
the relevant PRC laws and regulations in the PRC. The business license is the only permission that is required for our operations. The
business license is a permit issued by Market Supervision and Administration that allows the company to conduct specific business within
the government s geographical jurisdiction. Each of our PRC subsidiaries has received its business license. 

As
of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Muliang Viagoo and our subsidiaries are not required to obtain any other permissions
or approvals from any Chinese authorities to operate its business. However, applicable laws and regulations may be tightened, and new
laws or regulations may be introduced to impose additional government approval, license and permit requirements. If we or our subsidiaries
fail to obtain and maintain such approvals, licenses, or permits required for our business, inadvertently conclude that such approval
is not required, or respond to changes in the regulatory environment, we or our subsidiaries could be subject to liabilities, penalties
and operational disruption, which may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the value
of our ordinary shares, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or
cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

The
M A Rules, which were adopted in 2006 by six PRC regulatory agencies and amended in 2009, including the CSRC, purport to require
offshore special purpose vehicles that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals and that were formed for the purpose of seeking
a public listing on an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies or assets to obtain CSRC approval prior
to publicly listing and trading of their securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations
remain unclear, and this offering may ultimately require approval from the CSRC. If CSRC approval is required, it is uncertain how long
it will take us to obtain the approval and whether we will obtain the approval. 

Recently,
the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued
the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The
Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal
securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such
as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-based overseas
listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. It is still uncertain how PRC governmental
authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals. Furthermore,
if the CSRC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for this
offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain such approvals which could significantly limit or completely hinder our
ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. 

On
December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) (the Administration Provisions ),
and the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft
for Comments) (the Measures ), which are now open for public comments. The Administration Provisions and Measures for overseas
listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management, strengthening regulatory coordination,
and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out relevant security screening procedures
if their businesses involve such supervision. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. 

According
to Relevant Officials of the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions CSRC Answers ), after the Administration Provisions and Measures
are implemented upon completion of public consultation and due legislative procedures, the CSRC will formulate and issue guidance for
filing procedures to further specify the details of filing administration and ensure that market entities could refer to clear guidelines
for filing, which means it still takes time to make the Administration Provisions and Measures into effect. As the Administration Provisions
and Measures have not yet come into effect, we are currently unaffected. However, according to CSRC Answers, only new initial public
offerings and follow-on offerings by existent overseas listed Chinese companies will be required to go through the filing process; other
existent overseas listed companies will be allowed sufficient transition period to complete their filing procedure, which means if we
complete the offering prior to the effectiveness of Administration Provisions and Measures, we will be required go through the filing
process in the future, either because of future follow-on offerings or as an existent overseas listed Chinese company. 

69 

Our
PRC counsel has advised us that neither the holding company and our subsidiaries are currently required to obtain approval from Chinese
authorities, including the CSRC, or the CAC, to list on U.S exchanges or issue securities to foreign investors, given that: (i) our PRC
subsidiary was incorporated as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise by means of direct investment rather than by merger or acquisition of
equity interest or assets of a PRC domestic company owned by PRC companies or individuals as defined under the M A Rules that are
our beneficial owners; (ii) the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings like
ours under this prospectus are subject to the M A Rules; and (iii) no provision in the M A Rules clearly classifies contractual
arrangements as a type of transaction subject to the M A Rules. 

However,
there remains some uncertainty as to how the M A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering
and the opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations
in any form relating to the M A Rules. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies, including the CSRC, would reach
the same conclusion as our PRC counsel does, and hence we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from the CSRC or other PRC regulatory
agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in China, limit our operating privileges in China,
delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from this offering into China, restrict or prohibit the payments or remittance of
dividends by our PRC subsidiaries, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of the shares. It is uncertain when and whether the Company
will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and even when such permission
is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. 

The
PRC government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations. For
example, the PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education
and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding
any industry that could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. Recently, the PRC
government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews,
and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. As confirmed by our PRC counsel, we currently are not subject to cybersecurity
review with the CAC, to conduct business operations in China, given that: (i) we do not possess a large amount of personal information
in our business operations; and (ii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be
classified as core or important data by the authorities. In addition, as confirmed by our PRC counsel, we are not subject to merger control
review by China s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor
WWC, P.C., and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence
over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB 400 million. 

Although
we are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC governmental agencies to obtain such permission and has not received
any denial to list on the U.S. exchange or conduct our daily business operation, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative
regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will
be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business
operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.

Item 6. [Reserved] 

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. 

The
information set forth in this section contains certain forward-looking statements , including, among others (i) expected
changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing our business.
Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking
statements may be identified by use of terms such as believes , anticipates , intends or expects .
These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth
of our business including entering into future agreements with companies, and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market
our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and
financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds
of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion
of forward-looking statements in this Annual Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives
or plans will be achieved. 

We
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting
forward-looking statements. 

Our
revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of the our company to
insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations
domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses. 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other
financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview 

We primarily engage in the manufacturing and distribution
of organic fertilizer and the sales of agricultural products in the PRC. Our organic fertilizer products are sold under our brand names
 Zongbao, Fukang, and Muliang. 

Through our patented technology, we process crop
straw (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic nutritious fertilizers that are easily absorbed
by crops in three hours. Straws are common agricultural by-products. In PRC, farmers usually remove the straw stubble that are remains
after grains, by burning them in order to continue farming on the same land. These activities have resulted in significant air pollution,
and they damage the surface structure of the soil with loss of nutrients. We turn waste into treasure by transforming the straws into
organic fertilizer, which also effectively reduces air pollution. The organic straw fertilizer we produce does not contain the heavy metals,
antibiotics and harmful bacteria that are common in the traditional manure fertilizer. Our fertilizers also provide optimum levels of
primary plant nutrients, including multi-minerals, proteins and carbohydrates that promote the healthiest soils capable of growing the
healthy crops and vegetables. It can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as reduce the penetration
of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil, thus avoiding water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve
the fertility of soil, and the quality and safety of agricultural products. 

We generated our revenue mainly from our organic
fertilizers, which accounted for approximately 93.2 and 91.5 of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. We currently have two integrated factories in Weihai City, Shandong Province, PRC to produce our organic fertilizers, which
have been in operations since August 2015. We plan to improve the technology for our existing organic straw fertilizer production lines
in the following aspects: (i) adopt more advanced automatic control technology for raw material feed to shorten the processing time of
raw material, and (ii) manufacture powdered organic fertilizer instead of granular organic fertilizer production in order to avoid the
drying and cooling process, as such will increase our production capacity. 

In addition, we plan to engage in the processing
and distribution of black goat products, with business commencing in June 2023. We are currently constructing a deep-processing slaughterhouse
and processing plant which is expected to have the capacity of slaughtering 200,000 black goats per year in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province,
in China. Our black goat processing products including goat rib lets, goat loin roast, goat loin chops, goat rack, goat leg, goat shoulder,
goat leg shanks, ground goat, goat stew meat, whole goat, half goat, lamb viscera, etc. We expect to start generating revenue from the
black goat products in 2023.

Recent Development 

Impact of COVID-19 

Started in December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19
caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus has become widespread in China and in the rest of the world, including in each of the areas
in which the Company, its suppliers and its customers operate. In order to avoid the risk of the virus spreading, the Chinese government
enacted various restrictive measures, including suspending business operations and quarantines, starting from the end of January 2020.
We followed the requirements of local health authorities to suspend operation and production and have employees work remotely in February
and March 2020. Since April 2020, we gradually resumed production and are now operating at full capacity. 

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in December
2019 and continuing through 2020,2021 and 2022, the Company s businesses, results of operations, financial position and cash flows
were adversely affected in 2022 with potential continuing impacts on subsequent periods, including but not limited to the material adverse
impact on the Company s revenues as result of the suspension of operations and decline in demand by the Company s customers. 

Though the global outbreak and spread of the novel
strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) came to en end in November 2022, we are still taking steps in an effort to identify and mitigate the
adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business (including but not limited to our employees, customers, other business partners, our manufacturing
capabilities and capacity and our distribution channels) posed by its spread and the governmental and community reactions thereto. 

Disposal of land use right and production facility
for repayment of debt 

The Company completed its sale of industrial land
and production facility in Shanghai through an administratively organized private sale on June 16, 2021. Through the sale, the Company s
subsidiary Shanghai Zongbao is able to satisfy its debt obligations due to Agricultural Bank of China and Shanghai Zhongta Construction
and Engineering Co., Ltd. and improve its cash position. As a result of the sale, Agricultural Bank of China received RMB 35,632,193.36,
Shanghai Zhongta Construction and Engineering Co., Ltd. received RMB 26,000,000 and Shanghai Zongbao received the remaining RMB 7,921,902.28.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We evaluate, on an on-going basis, our estimates for reasonableness
as changes occur in our business environment. We base our estimates on experience, the use of independent third-party specialists and
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Critical accounting policies are defined as those
that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are our critical accounting policies: 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The basis of accounting differs from that used in the statutory accounts of the Company,
which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of the PRC PRC GAAP ). The differences between US GAAP and
PRC GAAP have been adjusted in these consolidated financial statements. The Company s functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi RMB and Singapore dollar( SGD however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated
and presented in United States Dollars USD ). 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, we had net accumulated deficit of 3,965,137 and 6,876,227 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our
cash balances as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 73,313 and 38,013, respectively. We had current liability of 9,221,958
at December 31, 2022 which would be due within the next 12 months. In addition, we had a working capital of 8,112,564 and working capital
of 5,403,720 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Because the company is gradually recovering the
accounts receivables affected by the Covid-19, and the sales are gradually returning to the normal level, the company s current
cash revenue and expenditure are normal, which did not affect the normal operation. Now, after Covid-19, the company has no problems with
business sustainability. IPO financing will be used for new investments to expand the operating scale and does not affect the existing
operating scale. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and consolidated VIE, including the VIE subsidiaries, for which the Muliang
Viagoo is the primary beneficiary. 

All transactions and balances among the Company,
its subsidiaries, the VIE and the VIE subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

As PRC laws and regulations welcome to invest
in organic fertilizer industry businesses, the Muliang Viagoo operates its fertilizer business in the PRC through Muliang Industry and
its subsidiaries, which are collectively referred as the WFOEs . 

75 

By entering into a series of agreements (the VIE
Agreements ), the Muliang Viagoo, through WFOEs, obtained control over Muliang Industry and its subsidiaries (collectively referred
as VIE ). The VIE Agreements enable the Muliang Viagoo to (1) have power to direct the activities that most significantly
affect the economic performance of the VIE, and (2) receive the economic benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.
Accordingly, the Muliang Viagoo is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE and has consolidated the VIE financial results
of operations, assets and liabilities in the Muliang Viagoo s consolidated financial statements. In making the conclusion that the
Muliang Viagoo is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Muliang Viagoo s rights under the Power of Attorney also provide the Muliang
Viagoo s abilities to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance. The Muliang Viagoo
also believes that this ability to exercise control ensures that the VIE will continue to execute and renew the Master Exclusive Service
Agreement and pay service fees to Muliang Viagoo. By charging service fees to be determined and adjusted at the sole discretion of Muliang
Viagoo, and by ensuring that the Master Exclusive Service Agreement is executed and remains effective, Muliang Viagoo has the rights to
receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIE.

VIE Agreements that were entered to give the Muliang
Viagoo effective control over the VIE include: 

Voting Rights Proxy Agreement and Irrevocable
Power of Attorney 

Under which each shareholder of the VIE grant
to any person designated by WFOEs to act as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all shareholder rights under PRC law and the relevant articles
of association, including but not limited to, appointing directors, supervisors and officers of the VIE as well as the right to sell,
transfer, pledge and dispose all or a portion of the equity interest held by such shareholders of the VIE. The proxy and power of attorney
agreements will remain effective as long as WFOEs exist. The shareholders of the VIE do not have the right to terminate the proxy agreements
or revoke the appointment of the attorney-in-fact without written consent of the WFOEs. 

Exclusive Option Agreement 

Under which each shareholder of the VIE granted
9F or any third party designated by 9F the exclusive and irrevocable right to purchase from such shareholders of the VIE, to the extent
permitted by PRC law and regulations, all or part of their respective equity interests in the VIE for a purchase price equal to the registered
capital. The shareholders of the VIE will then return the purchase price to 9F or any third party designated by 9F after the option is
exercised. 9F may transfer all or part of its option to a third party at its own option. The VIE and its shareholders agree that without
prior written consent of 9F, they may not transfer or otherwise dispose the equity interests or declare any dividends. The restated option
agreement will remain effective until 9F or any third party designated by 9F acquires all equity interest of the VIE. 

76 

Spousal Consent 

The spouse of each shareholder of the VIE has
entered into a spousal consent letter to acknowledge that he or she consents to the disposition of the equity interests held by his or
her spouse in the VIE in accordance with the exclusive option agreement, the power of attorney and the equity pledge agreement regarding
VIE structure described above, and any other supplemental agreement(s) may be consented by his or her spouse from time to time. Each
such spouse further agrees that he or she will not take any action or raise any claim to interfere with the arrangements contemplated
under the mentioned agreements. In addition, each such spouse further acknowledges that any right or interest in the equity interests
held by his or her spouse in the VIE do not constitute property jointly owned with his or her spouse and each such spouse unconditionally
and irrevocably waives any right or interest in such equity interests. 

Loan Agreement 

Pursuant to the loan agreements between WFOEs
and each shareholder of the VIE, WFOEs extended loans to the shareholders of the VIE, who had contributed the loan principal to the VIE
as registered capital. The shareholders of VIE may repay the loans only by transferring their respective equity interests in VIE to 9F Inc.
or its designated person(s) pursuant to the exclusive option agreements. These loan agreements will remain effective until the date
of full performance by the parties of their respective obligations thereunder. 

VIE Agreements that enables Muliang Viagoo to
receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIE include: 

Equity Interest Pledge Agreement 

Pursuant to equity interest pledge agreement,
each shareholder of the VIE has pledged all of his or her equity interest held in the VIE to WFOEs to secure the performance by VIE and
their shareholders of their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, including the payments due to WFOEs for services
provided. In the event that the VIE breach any obligations under these agreements, WFOEs as the pledgees, will be entitled to request
immediate disposal of the pledged equity interests and have priority to be compensated by the proceeds from the disposal of the pledged
equity interests. The shareholders of the VIE shall not transfer their equity interests or create or permit to be created any pledges
without the prior written consent of WFOEs. The equity interest pledge agreement will remain valid until the master exclusive service
agreement and the relevant exclusive option agreements and proxy and power of attorney agreements, expire or terminate. 

Master Exclusive Service Agreement 

Pursuant to exclusive service agreement, WFOEs
have the exclusive right to provide the VIE with technical support, consulting services and other services. WFOEs shall exclusively own
any intellectual property arising from the performance of the agreement. During the term of this agreement, the VIE may not accept any
services covered by this agreement provided by any third party. The VIE agree to pay service fees to be determined and adjusted at the
sole discretion of the WFOEs. The agreement will remain effective unless WFOEs terminate the agreement in writing. 

Risks in relation to the VIE structure 

Muliang Viagoo believes that the contractual arrangements
with the VIE and their current shareholders are in compliance with PRC laws and regulations and are legally enforceable. However, uncertainties
in the PRC legal system could limit the Muliang Viagoo s ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. If the legal structure
and contractual arrangements were found to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations, the PRC government could: 

Revoke the business and operating licenses of the Muliang Viagoo s PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities; 

Discontinue or restrict the operations of any related-party transactions among the Muliang Viagoo s PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities; 

Impose fines or other requirements on the Muliang Viagoo s PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities; 

Require the Muliang Viagoo s PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities to revise the relevant ownership structure or restructure operations; and/or; 

Restrict or prohibit the Muliang Viagoo s use of the proceeds of the additional public offering to finance the Muliang Viagoo s business and operations in China; 

Shut down the Muliang Viagoo s servers or blocking the Muliang Viagoo s online platform; 

Discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Muliang Viagoo s operations; and/or 

Require the Muliang Viagoo to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring. 

77 

Muliang Viagoo s ability to conduct its
business may be negatively affected if the PRC government were to carry out any of the aforementioned actions. As a result, Muliang Viagoo
may not be able to consolidate the VIE in its consolidated financial statements as it may lose the ability to exert effective control
over the VIE and its shareholders, and it may lose the ability to receive economic benefits from the VIE. Muliang Viagoo currently does
not believe that any penalties imposed or actions taken by the PRC government would result in the liquidation of the Company, WFOEs, or
the VIE. 

The following table sets forth the assets, liabilities,
results of operations and cash flows of the VIE and their subsidiaries, which are included in Muliang Viagoo s consolidated financial
statements after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions: 

Under the VIE Arrangements, Muliang Viagoo has
the power to direct activities of the VIE and can have assets transferred out of the VIE. Therefore, Muliang Viagoo considers that there
is no asset in the VIE that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE, except for assets that correspond to the amount of the
registered capital and PRC statutory reserves, if any. As the VIE are incorporated as limited liability companies under the Company Law
of the PRC, creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the general credit of Muliang Viagoo for any of the liabilities of the VIE. 

Currently there is no contractual arrangement
which requires Muliang Viagoo to provide additional financial support to the VIE. However, as Muliang Viagoo conducts its businesses primarily
based on the licenses held by the VIE, Muliang Viagoo has provided and will continue to provide financial support to the VIE. 

Revenue-producing assets held by the VIE include
certain internet content provision ICP licenses and other licenses, domain names and trademarks. The ICP licenses and
other licenses are required under relevant PRC laws, rules and regulations for the operation of internet businesses in the PRC, and
therefore are integral to Muliang Viagoo s operations. The ICP licenses require that core PRC trademark registrations and domain
names are held by the VIE that provide the relevant services. 

Muliang Viagoo consolidates the following entities,
including wholly-owned subsidiaries, Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Viagoo, and its wholly controlled variable interest entities, Muliang
Industry, and Zhongbao, 60 controlled Agritech Development, 99 controlled Fukang, 65 controlled Zhonglian, 80 controlled Yunnan Muliang,
100 controlled Anhui Muliang, 65 controlled Maguan, and 51 controlled Heilongjiang. Accordingly, the 40 equity interest holder of
Agritech Development, 1 equity interest holders in Fukang, 35 equity interest holders in Zhonglian, 20 interest in Yunnan Muliang,
35 equity interest in Maguan, and 49 equity interest in Heilongjiang are accounted as non-controlling interest in the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets and the valuation
of inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable 

We state accounts receivable at cost, net of allowance
for doubtful accounts. Based on our past experience and current practice in the PRC, management provides for an 100 allowance for doubtful
accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within one year, and 50 for receivables outstanding for longer than six
months. It is management s belief that the current bad debt allowance adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on management s
judgment. 

Inventory Valuation 

We value our fertilizer inventories at the lower
of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realizable value (the estimated market price). Substantially all inventory expenses,
packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method. 

78 

Revenue Recognition 

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606
using the modified retrospective method. Results for the reporting period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606,
while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company s historic accounting
under Topic 605. 

Management has determined that the adoption of
ASC 606 did not impact the Company s previously reported financial statements in any prior period nor did it result in a cumulative
effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. 

Revenue for sale of products is derived from contracts
with customers, which primarily include the sale of fertilizer products and environmental protection equipment. The Company s sales
arrangements do not contain variable consideration. The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time based on management s evaluation
of when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and control of the products has been transferred
to the customer. For vast majority of the Company s product sales, the performance obligations and control of the products transfer
to the customer when products are delivered, and customer acceptance is made. 

Revenue for logistics-related service is derived
from Viagoo subsidiaries. Through an online service platform, the company provides the operation management service to support customers.
For VTM service, revenue is charged to carriers based on certain percentage of the freight charges. For VES service, revenue is recognized
based on monthly subscription by vehicles and by users. For system integration service, revenue is recognized over time based on the progress
of project and annual maintenance service. 

Pursuant to the guidance of ASC Topic 840, rent
shall be reported as income by lessors over the lease term as it becomes receivable. The Company leased part of the building
of the Shanghai new plant to third parties as a warehouse. The Company recognizes building leasing revenue over the beneficial period
described by the agreement, as the revenue is realized or realizable and earned. 

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under the
provision of FASB ASC 740-10, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
be realized. 

New Accounting Standards 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02) Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. For finance leases, a lessee is required to do the following: 

Recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position 

Recognize interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income 

Classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. 

79 

For operating leases, a lessee is required to
do the following: 

Recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position 

Recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis 

Classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. 

In July 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2018-11 (ASU 2018-11), which amends ASC 842 so that entities may elect not to recast their comparative periods in transition
(the Comparatives Under 840 Option ). ASU 2018-11 allows entities to change their date of initial application to the beginning
of the period of adoption. In doing so, entities would: 

Apply ASC 840 in the comparative periods. 

Provide the disclosures required by ASC 840 for all periods that continue to be presented in accordance with ASC 840. 

Recognize the effects of applying ASC 842 as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the period of adoption. 

In addition, the FASB also issued a series of
amendments to ASU 2016-02 that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of
the new lease standard. 

The management has reviewed the accounting pronouncements
and adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair
Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement , 
which makes a number of changes meant to add, modify or remove certain disclosure requirements associated with the movement amongst or
hierarchy associated with Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this Update modify the disclosure requirements
on fair value measurements based on the concepts in FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting Chapter
8: Notes to Financial Statements, including the consideration of costs and benefits. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and
losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative
description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in
the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective
date. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2018-13 on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU provides an exception to the general methodology
for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. This update also
(1) requires an entity to recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account
for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, (2) requires an entity to evaluate when a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill
should be considered part of the business combination in which goodwill was originally recognized for accounting purposes and when it
should be considered a separate transaction, and (3) requires that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates
in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The standard is effective for the
Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of
evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02,

Results of Operations 

We are principally engaged in the organic fertilizer
manufacture and distribution business in the PRC, which account for 93.2 of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in December
2019 and continuing in the year of 2020,2021,and 2022, the Company s businesses, results of operations, financial position and cash
flows were adversely affected in 2022. However, the COVID-19 came to an end in November, 2022 in China. And we are growing our revenue
and net income steadily currently and expect to keep growing for the coming years.

Revenue. 

Revenue for fertilizer increased from 9,730,962
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 11,049,883 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represented an increase of 1,318,921,
or approximately 13.6 . The increase in revenue was mainly due to the end of economic depression resulting from continuous impact of COVID-19
in November 2022. We expect to see a trend of improving sales as the epidemic moves further into the past. 

Revenue for logistic decreased from 904,320 for
the year ended December 31, 2021 to 803,369 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represented a decrease of 100,951, or 11.2 . 

Cost of sales 

Cost of sales for fertilizer increased from 5,910,703
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 6,358,418 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represented an increase of approximately
 447,715, or 7.6 . The increase in cost of revenue was in line with the increase in revenue. 

Cost of sales for logistic decreased from 477,978
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 565,299 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represented an increase of 87,321, or 18.3 . 

81

The gross profit for fertilizer increased from
 3,820,259 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to gross profit of 4,691,465 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The gross margin inreased
from 39.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 42.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increased gross margin was due to the
decrease in material cost.. 

The gross profit for logistic decreased from 426,342
for the year ended December 31, 2021 to gross profit of 238,070 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The gross margin decreased from
47.1 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 29.6 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Expenses . 

We incurred 323,789 in selling expenses for the year ended December
31, 2022, compared to 467,859 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred 897,822 in general and administrative expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2,033,234 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased by 1,279,482, or 51.2 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. Our selling expenses decreased
by 144,070 and our general and administrative expenses decreased by 1,135,412. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was
due to the improved management for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect our general and administrative expense to increase for
the next year, if we successfully complete our public offering. 

Interest expense 

We incurred 124,730 in interest expense during
the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with interest expense of 151,720 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decreased interest
expense reflects the decreased loan balance as of December 31, 2022. 

Net Income . 

Our net income was 2,919,536 for the year ended
December 31, 2022, compared with net income of 1,731,177 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 1,188,359,
or 68.6 . The significant increase in net income was mainly due to the significant decrease in General and administrative expenses, the
significant increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate
funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021 our working capital was 8,112,564 and 5,403,720, respectively. The improvement in our working capital deficit
was reflecting faster decrease in our current liability, especially the significant decrease in account payable and accrued liability
balance. 

We have financed our operations over the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily through proceeds from stock issuance and advances from related parties, and net cash inflow
from operations. 

The components of cash flows are discussed below:

Cash provided by (used ini)Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 1,302,022 for the year ended
December 31, 2022. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of an increase of 1,488,529
in account receivable, an increase of 1,655,546 in other receivable, and a decrease of 4,332,753 in account payable and accrued liability,
which was offset by net income of 2,919,536, depreciation and amortization of 494,439, and a decrease of 2,720,957 in prepayment, and
the assets impairment loss of 237,191. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 4,930,236 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted
primarily of net income of 1,731,177 which was adjusted by depreciation and amortization of 513,563. The Company had a decrease of 1,978,747
in account receivable, a decrease of 10,758,708 in other receivable, which was offset by an increase of 6,292,144 in prepayment and
a decrease of 2,393,158 in accounts payable and accrued payables. 

82 

Cash used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 126,208
for the year ended December 31, 2022. The investment activity was payments made for intangible assets. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 1,158,773

Cash provided by (used in) Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was
 1,444,460 for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the period, cash provided by financing activities consisted of borrowing of 1,755,885
from related party, offset by short term loan repayment of 311,425. 

Net cash used in financing activities was 4,363,568
for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year, cash provided by financing activities included repayment of short-term loans of

We anticipate that our current cash reserves plus
cash from our operating activities will not be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations and fund our operations for the next twelve
months. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We are looking to obtain additional funding through equity
financing in the secondary market, and/or renewing our current obligations with loaners. We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from
our directors or unrelated parties. Additional funding may not be available, or at acceptable terms, to us at this time. If we are unable
to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business
plans, financial condition and operating results.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To:
 
 The
 Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Muliang
 Viagoo Technology, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Muliang Viagoo Technology, Inc., its subsidiaries and its variable interest
entities (collectively the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income
and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 2 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Accounts receivable 

We assessed the carrying value of accounts receivable
as a critical audit matter. A s of December 31, 2022, the Company s accounts receivable balance
was quantitatively material to the financial statements as a whole, and the account required challenging, subjective and complex
judgment and assumptions in regards the estimation of the net carrying value. 

The Company s accounts receivable is stated
at gross receivables less an allowance for bad debt based on management assessment of collectability of those balances. 

Our principal audit procedures performed to address
the net carrying value of the accounts receivables and related bad debt expense included the following: 

Independently sending confirmation to the Company s customers and checking for subsequent payment from customers. 

Inquired with Company personnel to understand management s assessment on the credit worthiness of the Company s customers and the recoverability of the receivables. 

Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis on accounts receivable aging and past collections from customers, and researched if there are any historical, geographical or industry trends that would influence collectability. 

The accounts relevant to this critical audit matter
include the accounts receivable, allowance for bad det, and bad debt expense, and the related disclosure in the accompanying note 3 to
the financial statements.

The benefit from the carry forward of such NOLs will begin expiring during the year ended December 31, 2034. Because United States tax

advantage of its NOLs for federal income tax purposes should the Company generate taxable income. Further, the benefit from utilization

There

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with
the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (the Company s principal
executive officer and interim principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. Our internal control system was designed to, in general, provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and
board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, but because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The framework
used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO - 2013 Framework ). Based
on that assessment, based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective,
as of December 31, 2022. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial
reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that amounted to material weaknesses. 

The
matters involving internal control over financial reporting that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent
members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives
of having segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions and the custody of assets; and (3) ineffective
controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022. 

To
address the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) discussed above, management performed additional analyses and other procedures
to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

84 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we plan to initiate,
the following series of measures: 

We
plan to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to
us. First, we plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals perform
(i) the initiation of transactions, (ii) the recording of transactions and (iii) the custody of assets. Second, we will create a senior
position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the
effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information. Third, we plan to appoint
one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning
audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such
as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. 

Management
believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy
the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board. We did not implement the said remedial
measures during the period ended December 31, 2022. 

On
March 17, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the nomination of Vick Bathija, Guofu Zhang and Scott Silverman as independent directors,
as defined under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15), appointment of whom shall be effective upon approval of Company s application
to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, the Board approved the adoption of the audit, compensation and nomination committees.
Mr. Bathija, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Zhang shall serve as the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee,
respectively. All appointment will be effective upon the Company s listing on Nasdaq. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over financial reporting 

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
