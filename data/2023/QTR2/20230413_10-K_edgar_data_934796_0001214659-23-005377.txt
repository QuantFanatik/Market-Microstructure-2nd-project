Our employees are not represented by a labor organization

We are required under PRC law to make contributions
to employee benefit plans at specified percentages of the after-tax profit. In addition, we are required by the PRC law to cover our employees
in China with various type of social insurance. We believe that we are in material compliance with the relevant PRC laws. 

Government Regulation 

Advertising Services 

Business Licenses for Advertising Companies 

The principal regulations governing the advertising
businesses in China include: 

l The Advertising Law (1994); 

l Regulations on Control of Advertisement (1987); and 

l The Implementing Rules for the Advertising Administrative Regulations (2004). 

These regulations stipulate that companies that
engage in advertising activities must obtain from the SAIC or its local branches a business license which specifically includes operating
an advertising business within its business scope. Companies conducting advertising activities without such a license may be subject to
penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income and orders to cease advertising operations. The business license of an
advertising company is valid for the duration of its existence, unless the license is suspended or revoked due to a violation of any relevant
law or regulation.

 Table of Contents 

We do not expect to encounter any difficulties
in maintaining our business licenses. Our PRC advertising operating companies hold business license from the local branches of the SAIC
as required by the existing PRC regulations. 

Advertising Content 

PRC advertising laws and regulations set forth
certain content requirements for advertisements in China, which include prohibitions on, among other things, misleading content, superlative
wording, socially destabilizing content or content involving obscenities, superstition, violence, discrimination or infringement of the
public interest. Advertisements for anesthetic, psychotropic, toxic or radioactive drugs are prohibited. It is prohibited to disseminate
tobacco advertisements via broadcast or print media. It is also prohibited to display tobacco advertisements in any waiting lounge, theater,
cinema, conference hall, stadium or other public area. There are also specific restrictions and requirements regarding advertisements
that relate to matters such as patented products or processes, pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
foodstuffs, alcohol and cosmetics. In addition, all advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and
veterinary pharmaceuticals advertised through radio, film, television, newspaper, magazine and other forms of media, together with any
other advertisements which are subject to censorship by administrative authorities according to relevant laws and administrative regulations,
must be submitted to the relevant administrative authorities for content approval prior to dissemination. 

Advertisers, advertising operators and advertising
distributors are required by PRC advertising laws and regulations to ensure that the content of the advertisements they prepare or distribute
are true and in full compliance with applicable laws. In providing advertising services, advertising operators and advertising distributors
must review the prescribed supporting documents provided by advertisers for advertisements and verify that the content of the advertisements
comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations. In addition, prior to distributing advertisements for certain commodities, which are
subject to government censorship and approval, advertising distributors and advertisers are obligated to ensure that such censorship has
been performed and approval has been obtained. Violation of these regulations may result in penalties, including fines, confiscation of
advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an advertisement correcting the misleading
information. In circumstances involving serious violations, the SAIC or its local branches may revoke violators licenses or permits
for advertising business operations. Furthermore, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors may be subject to civil
liability if they infringe on the legal rights and interests of third parties in the course of their advertising business. We have implemented
procedures to ensure the content of our advertisement are properly reviewed and the advertisement would only be published upon the receipt
of content approval from the relevant administrative authorities. However, we provide no assurance that all the content of the advertisement
are true and in full compliance with applicable laws. 

Out-of-home Advertising 

The Advertising Law stipulates that the exhibition
and display of out-of-home advertisements must not: 

l utilize traffic safety facilities and traffic signs; 

l impede the use of public facilities, traffic safety facilities and traffic signs; 

l obstruct commercial and public activities or create an eyesore in urban areas; 

l be placed in restrictive areas near government offices, cultural landmarks or historical
or scenic sites; and 

l be placed in areas prohibited by the local governments from having out-of-home advertisements. 

In addition to the Advertising Law, the SAIC promulgated
the Out-of-home Advertising Registration Administrative Regulations on December 8, 1995, as amended on December 3, 1998, and May 22, 2006,
which governs the out-of-home advertising industry in China. 

Out-of-home advertisements in China must be registered
with the local SAIC before dissemination. The advertising distributors are required to submit a registration application form and other
supporting documents for registration. After review and examination, if an application complies with the requirements, the local SAIC
will issue an Out-of-home Advertising Registration Certificate for such advertisement. Many municipal cities of China have respectively
promulgated their own local regulations on the administration of out-of-home advertisements. Those municipal regulations set forth specific
requirements on the out-of-home advertisements, such as the allowed places of dissemination and size requirements of the out-of-home advertisement
facilities. 

Foreign Currency Exchange 

The principal regulation governing foreign currency
exchange in China is the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control (1996), as amended. Under these rules, Renminbi is freely convertible for trade
and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loan or investment outside China without the prior approval
of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC or other relevant authorities is obtained. 

4 

 Table of Contents 

Pursuant to the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control,
foreign investment enterprises in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange
of the PRC for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions.
They may also exchange Renminbi into foreign currencies (subject to a cap approved by the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of
the PRC) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate
the ability of foreign investment enterprises to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions
for direct investment, loan and investment outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the State Administration
for Foreign Exchange of the PRC. 

Dividend Distributions 

The principal regulations governing distribution
of dividends of wholly foreign-owned companies include: 

l the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended; and 

l Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001). 

Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises
in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.
In addition, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China are required to set aside at least 10 of their after-tax profits each year, if
any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such reserve funds have reached 50 of the enterprise s registered capital. These reserves
are restricted and not distributable as cash dividends. 

We have not received any dividends or fees from
our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated Chinese entities in the past three years. As all our PRC subsidiaries are currently still operating
at a net loss, we are unable to estimate the time to receive dividends or other fees. 

Enterprise Income Tax Law 

The Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, was
promulgated by the PRC s National People s Congress on March 16, 2007 to introduce a new uniform taxation regime in the PRC.
Both resident and non-resident enterprises deriving income from the PRC were subject to the EIT Law from January 1, 2008. It applies a
single income tax rate to all enterprises in the PRC. Under this EIT Law, enterprises that qualify as new and high technology enterprises high-tech companies are entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15 and in other very limited situation entities may be
subject to a EIT rate of 20 , but the general EIT rate is 25 . 

We believe that each of our PRC operating entities
were resident enterprises and subject to the enterprise income tax rate of 25 for their global income. We do not believe that any of
our off-shore entities are resident enterprises as our off-shore entities didn t provide any services in the PRC and their management
and controls are all located outside China; permanent establishment does not exist and hence they would not fall into the resident enterprise
category. However, we cannot provide assurance that all our offshore operating entities are not resident enterprises as
there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of current PRC tax rule and regulation. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company's operations are subject to various
environmental regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment and that our compliance will have no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive

Dividend Policy 

The Company has not declared any dividends since
incorporation and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available
funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. 

Our subsidiaries in the PRC may pay dividends
to us through our Hong Kong subsidiaries, NCN Group (Global) Limited. Current PRC regulations only allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends
to us out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Also in accordance
with its articles of association, each of our subsidiaries in the PRC is required to allocate to its enterprise development reserve at
least 10 of its respective after-tax profits determined in accordance with the PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our
subsidiaries in the PRC may stop allocations to its general reserve if such reserve has reached 50 of its registered capital. Allocations
to the reserve can only be used for making up losses and other specified purposes and may not be paid to us in forms of loans, advances,
or cash dividends. Dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to NCN Group (Global) Limited, our Hong Kong subsidiaries, will not be subject
to Hong Kong capital gains or other income tax under current Hong Kong laws and regulations because they will not be deemed to be assessable
income derived from or arising in Hong Kong. 

We have not received any dividends or any other
fees, including consulting fees, from our PRC subsidiaries or our affiliated Chinese entities in the past three years as all of our PRC
operating companies, including our PRC subsidiaries and variable interest entities, are currently operating at an accumulated deficit
and the above dividend restriction prevent us from receiving any dividends in the short term until they turn into accumulated profit.
As such, we could only receive funds from them through the repayment of intercompany loans by our PRC subsidiaries or charging them service
fees through the provision of management services. If our PRC operating entities continue to operate at a net loss, we will need to raise
funds through the issuance of equity and debt securities to satisfy future payment requirements, and there is no assurance that we will
be successful in raising such funds. 

Our board of directors has discretion on whether
to pay dividends unless the distribution would render us unable to repay our debts as they become due. Even if our board of directors
decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and
surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. For instance,
the terms of the outstanding promissory notes issued contain restrictions on the payment of dividends. The dividend restrictions provide
that the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall not declare or pay dividends or other distributions in respect of the equity securities
of such entity other than dividends or distributions of cash which amounts during any 12-month period that exceed ten percent (10 of
the consolidated net income of the Company based on the Company s most recent audited financial statements disclosed in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K (or equivalent form) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following management s discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information
appearing elsewhere in this annual report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking
information. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above for certain information concerning those forward
looking statements. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. References in
this Report to a particular fiscal year are to our fiscal year ended on December 31. 

Overview of Our Business 

Our mission is to become a leader in advertising media and actively
serve brand customers. Our service is to provide our brand customers with integrated intelligent marketing solutions based on big data.
We are committed to actively developing a new core retail channel Community Channel in the Chinese advertising field and
strive to continue to develop this core to the whole of China in the future of each large and small community that makes us a leader in
the core of the advertising industry. 

Total advertising revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 106,498 and nil, respectively. Our net loss profit was 925,278 and 1,215,636 for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The Company will continually explore new media projects in order to provide a wider range of media and
advertising services. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

In December 2019, an
outbreak of COVID-19 was identified in China and was subsequently recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO on March 11, 2020. Since that time, COVID-19 has spread around the world and throughout the United States, including in the regions and
countries in which we operate. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S and around the world have imposed restrictions on travel
and business operations and are advising or requiring individuals to limit or eliminate time outside of their homes. Temporary closures
of businesses have also been ordered in certain jurisdictions, and other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These actions
expanded significantly in March and April of 2020 throughout the U.S. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the
level of economic activity in the U.S. and around the world. 

The outbreak has resulted
in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as quarantines and shelter in place orders. These measures
may remain in place for a significant period of time and adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition as well as
the business, operations and financial conditions of our business partners. The spread of the virus has also caused us to modify our business
practices (including employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings) in ways that may be detrimental to
our business (including working remotely and its attendant cybersecurity risks). We may take further actions as may be required by government
authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient
to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. 

There has been no material
adverse impact on the Company s 2021 results of operations to date. The effect of COVID-19 and related events, those not yet known
or knowable, could have a negative effect on the stock price, business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations of the
Company, including as a result of quarantines, market volatility, market downturns and business closures. 

For the reasons discussed
above, the Company cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on the Company s
results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Notwithstanding any actions by national, state, and local governments to mitigate
the impact of COVID-19 or by the Company to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing
activities will be successful in mitigating or preventing significant adverse effects on the Company.

Going
Concern 

Our cash flow projections indicate that our current
assets and projected revenues from our existing project will not be sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months. This raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We intend to rely on debt securities as well as on our notes 
holders exercise of their conversion option to convert our notes to our common stock, in order to fund our operations. However,
it may be difficult for us to raise funds in the current economic environment. If adequate capital is not available to us, we may need
to sell assets, seek to undertake a restructuring of our obligations with our creditors, or even cease our operations. We cannot give
assurance that our notes holder will exercise their conversion option before the note is due. In any such case, we may not be able
to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited
to those related to income taxes and impairment of long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Based on our ongoing review, we
plan to adjust to our judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

 Table of Contents 

We believe the following critical accounting policies
are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our management's most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

(A) Basis of Presentation and Preparation 

These consolidated financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). 

(B) Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of Network CN Inc., its subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary.
These variable interest entities are those in which the Company, through contractual arrangements, bears the risks and enjoys the rewards
normally associated with ownership of the entities. Upon making this determination, the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary
of these entities, which are then required to be consolidated for financial reporting purpose. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

(C) Use of Estimates 

The Company's consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Estimates are used when accounting for certain
items such as accounting for income tax valuation allowances. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions
that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results
may differ. 

(D) Cash 

Cash includes cash on hand, cash accounts, and
interest-bearing savings accounts placed with banks and financial institutions. For the purposes of the statements of cash flow, the Company
considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
There were no cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

(E) Equipment, Net 

Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, less estimated residual values over the assets estimated
useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 

Office equipment 
 3 - 5 years 

When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed
of, the related cost, accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment loss, if any, are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Repairs and maintenance costs on equipment
are expensed as incurred. 

(F) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Long-lived assets, such as equipment, are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
from the asset s use and eventual disposition. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds
the fair value of the asset calculated using a undiscounted cash flow analysis. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

(G) Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets mainly acquired through purchased
intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are initially recognized and measured at cost. The useful lives of intangible assets are
assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are subsequently amortized over their useful economic
life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.

 Table of Contents 

Identifiable intangible assets that have determinable
lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method as follows: 

Advertising rights fee contracts 
 3 years 

(H) Accounts Receivable Net of Allowance for Expected Credit Losses 

Accounts receivable primarily represents revenue
recognized that was not invoiced at the balance sheet date and is primarily billed and collected in the following month. Trade accounts
receivable are carried at the original invoiced amount less an estimated allowance for expected credit losses based on the probability
of future collection. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that customer
invoices are past due, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments over historical loss data,
and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific accounts. When management becomes aware of circumstances that
may further decrease the likelihood of collection, it records a specific allowance against amounts due, which reduces the receivable to
the amount that management reasonably believes will be collected. The Company records changes in the estimate to the allowance for expected
credit losses through provision for expected credit losses and reverses the allowance after the potential for recovery is considered remote. 

(I) Leases 

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842) effective as of January 1, 2019. Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is
or contains a lease at contract inception. 

Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets represent
the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of
lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date of the lease. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and
any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less any lease incentive received. The Company uses its incremental
borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments based on the information available at the date of lease commencement.
The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over
a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Lease expense for an operating lease is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The Company elected to not separate non-lease
components from the associated lease components and to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term
of twelve months or less. 

(J) Convertible Promissory Notes and Warrants 

New 1 Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2025 

On January 14, 2020, the Company issued 1 unsecured
senior convertible promissory notes to an individual with the principal amount of 645,000. The 1 convertible promissory notes bore interest
at 1 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, matured on January 13, 2025, and were convertible at any time into shares of the Company s
common stock at a fixed conversion price of 1.00 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. 

The Company determined the 1 convertible promissory
notes to be conventional convertible instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Its embedded conversion option qualified
for equity classification. The 1 convertible promissory notes did not have any embedded conversion option which shall be bifurcated and
separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, nor did they contain a cash conversion feature. The Company accounted for the
Notes in accordance with ASC 470, as a single debt instrument. No beneficial conversion feature (the BCF was recognized
as the set conversion price for the Notes was greater than the fair value of the Company s share price at date of issuance. 

New 1 Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2027 

On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars 2,500,000). On the same date, the Company signed the
with 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement under which the Company may sell and issue to the Subscriber up to an aggregate maximum
amount of 2,500,000 in principal amount of Convertible Notes prior to January 19, 2027. The Convertible Promissory Notes issued to the
Investor are convertible at the holder s option into shares of Company common stock at 1.25 per share. 

14 

 Table of Contents 

The Company evaluates the conversion feature to
determine whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-20. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible
note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible notes payable and may not be settled in cash upon
conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible notes payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance
to the date the notes is due using the effective interest method. If the notes payable are retired prior to the end of their contractual
term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature
is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included
in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion. 

(K) Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts
with Customers , an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects
the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that are within the scope of the standard, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. The standard also includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment
costs. 

The Company recognize revenue when a customer
obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive
in exchange for such services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: 

1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer -
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party s rights
regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to those goods or services, (ii) the contract
has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred
is probable based on the customer s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer s
ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer s historical payment experience or,
in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. The contract term for contracts
that provide a right to terminate a contract for convenience without significant penalty will reflect the term that each party has enforceable
rights under the contract (the period through the earliest termination date). If the termination right is only provided to the customer,
the unsatisfied performance obligations will be evaluated as customer options as discussed below. 

2) Identify the performance obligations in the
contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the
customer that are both (i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together
with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and (ii) are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are not met the
promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Certain of our contracts (under which we deliver multiple
promised services) require us to perform integration activities where we bear risk with respect to integration activities. Therefore,
we must apply judgment to determine whether as a result of those integration activities and risks, the promised services are distinct
on the context of the contract. 

We typically do not include options that would
result in a material right. If options to purchase additional services or options to renew are included in customer contracts, we evaluate
the option in order to determine if our arrangement include promises that may represent a material right and needs to be accounted for
as a performance obligation in the contract with the customer. 

3) Determine the transaction price - The transaction
price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
Our contract prices may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or a combination of both fixed and variable amounts. To the extent the
transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction
price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors outside our control that
could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential
reversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required. 

4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the
single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price
to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets
the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance
obligation. For most performance obligations, we determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation
is sold separately. Although uncommon, if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to
the performance obligations. 

15 

 Table of Contents 

5) Recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a
performance obligation: we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point-in-time as discussed in further detail below.
Revenue is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a
customer. 

(L) Stock-based Compensation 

The Company complies with ASC Topic 718, Compensation
 Stock Compensation, using a modified prospective application transition method, which establishes accounting for stock-based awards
in exchange for employee services. Under this application, the Company is required to record stock-based compensation expense for all
awards granted. It requires that stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized
as expense over the requisite services period. 

The Company follows ASC topic 505-50, Accounting
for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services, 
for stock issued to consultants and other non-employees. In accordance with ACS Topic 505-50, the stock issued as compensation for services
provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the
stock, whichever can be more clearly determined. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to expense over the period
during which services are rendered. 

(M) Income Taxes 

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement basis and tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
estimates the degree to which tax assets and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction.
A valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined to be more likely than not that the
benefit of such deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. Tax benefits of operating loss carryforwards are evaluated
on an ongoing basis, including a review of historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward period, and other
circumstances. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the related valuation allowance on such assets would
be reduced. 

The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain
tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. Once this threshold has been met, the Company's measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized
in its consolidated financial statements. The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. 

(N) Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The Company follows ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive
Income, for the reporting and display of its comprehensive income (loss) and related components in the consolidated financial statements
and thereby reports a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise that results from transactions and economic events other than
transactions with the shareholders. Items of comprehensive income (loss) are reported in both the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of stockholders deficit. 

Accumulated other comprehensive income as presented
on the consolidated balance sheets consisted of the accumulative foreign currency translation adjustment at period end. 

(O) Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per common share are computed
in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earning per Share, by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to holders of common stock by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares including the dilutive effect of common share equivalents
then outstanding. 

The diluted net profit/(loss) per common share
is the same as the basic net profit/(loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as all potential common shares including
stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded from the computation of diluted net profit/(loss) per share. 

16 

 Table of Contents 

(P) Foreign Currency Translation 

The assets and liabilities of the Company s
subsidiaries and variable interest entity denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using the
applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet date. For consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss items, amounts
denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars were translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the period.
Equity accounts were translated at their historical exchange rates. Net gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign currency
on consolidated financial statements are included in the statements of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in the unaudited consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. 

(Q) Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure,
defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required
or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 

It establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial
instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. It establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Level 1 applies to assets or
liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 - Level 2 applies to assets or
liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 - Level 3 applies to assets or
liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value
of the assets or liabilities. 

The carrying value of the Company s financial
instruments, which consist of cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables,
and convertible promissory notes approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities. 

The carrying value of the Company s financial
instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is stated at a value being equal to the allocated proceeds
of convertible promissory notes based on the relative fair value of notes and warrants. In the measurement of the fair value of these
instruments, the Black-Scholes option pricing model is utilized, which is consistent with the Company s historical valuation techniques.
These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. As the allocated value of the financial instruments
related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is recorded in additional paid-in capital, the financial instruments
related to warrants were not required to mark to market as of each subsequent reporting period. The carrying value of the Company s
financial instruments related to options is measuring its fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is consistent
with the Company s historical valuation techniques. The fair value of option is recorded as dividend. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements
are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise
discussed, the recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations upon adoption. 

ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The follow discussion about our market risk disclosures
involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed
to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 

We have no significant interest-bearing assets
and our convertible promissory notes and short-term loans are fixed rate securities. Our current exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by our cash deposits in banks and the fair value of our invested securities.
Although we do not believe that interest rate has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, increase
in interest rates in the future could increase interest cost on our new debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing
debt and limit our acquisition and development activities.

 Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 

While our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar,
our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are substantially denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign
exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and
RMB. If the RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar
financial statements will decline. If the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, any new RMB-denominated investments or expenditures
will be more costly to us. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates while stockholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income, a component
of stockholders equity. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign
currency exchange risk. 

The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and
other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China s political and economic conditions. Since July 2005, the
RMB has not been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market
to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against
the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations
in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. 

Inflation Risk 

Inflationary factors such as increases in the
costs to acquire advertising rights and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation
has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have
an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenues if the selling prices of our services do not increase with these increased costs.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported during the year and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Earnest Leung, and our Chief Financial Officer, Shirley Cheng, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and published consolidated financial statements. 

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of
December 31, 2022, in accordance with Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Based on and as a result of this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that as of the end of the period covered by this annual report,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial
reporting that existed as of such date as discussed below.

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, a system
of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s consolidated
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention
by those charged with government. 

Our management, with the participation and under
the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, Earnest Leung and our Chief Financial Officer, Shirley Cheng, conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal
Control- Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
evaluation, Dr. Leung and Ms. Cheng determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . 

We regularly review our system of internal
control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring
that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Board Leadership Structure 

Our Board leadership
structure is currently composed of combined Chairperson of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
and the other members of our Board of Directors are non-executive members. The Board has three outstanding committees: (1) Audit Committee;
(2) Remuneration Committee and (3) Nomination Committee. All these committees are composed of non-executive directors only. 

Our Board of Directors
has also determined a lead independent director is not necessary and has not appointed one at this time. In making these determinations,
the Board of Directors considered the relative size of the Company, the size of the Board of Directors and the fact that all the other
members of the Board of Directors are non-executive directors. The Board of Directors believes that Dr. Earnest Leung serves as both Chairperson
of the board and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Dr. Leung is the director most familiar
with the PRC environment and our business, possess in-depth diverse business management experience, and is most capable of effectively
identifying strategic priorities and leading the discussion and execution of strategy. The current combined position of Chairperson and
Chief Executive Officer promotes a unified direction and leadership for the Board and gives a single, clear focus for the chain of command
for our organization, strategy and business plans. The Board of Directors also believes that our overall corporate governance policies
and practices adequately address any governance concerns raised by the dual chairperson and chief executive officer role.

Corporate Governance 

Our board of directors currently has three standing
committees which perform various duties on behalf of and report to the board of directors: (i) audit committee, (ii) remuneration committee
and (iii) nominating committee. From time to time, the board of directors may establish other committees. Each of the three standing committees
is comprised entirely of independent directors as follows: 

Name of Director 
 Audit 
 Nominating 
 
 Remuneration 

Frederick Wong 
 C 
 C 
 C 
 
 ________ 

 C = Chairperson 

 M = Member 

 The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter
for each of these committees, copies of which can be found on our website at www.ncnmedia.com . 

Audit Committee 

Our board of directors established an Audit Committee
in September 2007. Our Audit Committee currently consists of one member: Mr. Frederick Wong. The
Company does not have a qualified financial expert at this time because it has not been able to hire a qualified candidate. Further, the
Company believes that it has inadequate financial resources at this time to hire such an expert. The Company intends to continue to search
for a qualified individual for hire. Mr. Frederick Wong serves as the chairperson of the Audit Committee. 

The Audit Committee oversees our accounting, financial
reporting and audit processes; appoints, determines the compensation of, and oversees, the independent auditors; pre-approves audit and
non-audit services provided by the independent auditors; reviews the results and scope of audit and other services provided by the
independent auditors; reviews the accounting principles and practices and procedures used in preparing our consolidated financial statements;
and reviews our internal controls. 

The Audit Committee works closely with management
and our independent auditors. The Audit Committee also meets with our independent auditors without members of management present on regularly
basis to review the results of their work. The Audit Committee also meets with our independent auditors to approve the annual scope and
fees for the audit services to be performed. 

Remuneration Committee 

Our board of directors established a Remuneration
Committee in September 2007. Our Remuneration Committee consists of one member: Mr. Frederick Wong. 

The Remuneration Committee (i) oversees and
makes general recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding our compensation and benefits policies; (ii) oversees, evaluates
and approves cash and stock compensation plans, policies and programs for our executive officers; and (iii) oversees and sets compensation
for the Board of Directors. Our Chief Executive Officer may not be present at any meeting of our compensation committee during which his
compensation is deliberated. 

All the compensation packages for executive officers
and directors including both employee directors and non-employee directors are recommended and proposed by the Remuneration Committee.
In determining compensation for executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Remuneration Committee considers, among
other things, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. However, the full Board of Directors determines all such compensation
packages. 

The Remuneration Committee may, in its discretion,
delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a sub-committee of the Remuneration Committee consisting of one or more
members of the Committee. The Remuneration Committee has no current intention to delegate any of its authority to any subcommittee. Also,
the Remuneration Committee did not engage any compensation consultants in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive
and director compensation in the past. 

Nominating Committee 

Our board of directors established a Nominating Committee in September
2007. Our Nominating Committee currently consists of one member: Mr. Frederick Wong. 

The Nominating Committee (i) considers and
periodically reports on matters relating to the identification, selection and qualification of the Board of Directors and candidates nominated
to the Board of Directors and its committees; (ii) develops and recommends governance principles applicable to the Company; and (iii) oversees
the evaluation of the Board of Directors and management from a corporate governance perspective. 

Although our bylaws do not contain provisions
which specifically address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board of Directors
at our annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. In evaluating
candidates submitted by stockholders, the Nominating Committee will consider (in addition to the criteria applicable to all director candidates
described below) the needs of the Board and the qualifications of the candidate, and may also take into consideration the number of shares
held by the recommending stockholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. In general, to have a candidate considered
by the Nominating Committee, a stockholder must submit the recommendation in writing and must include the following information: 

1. 
 The name of the stockholder and evidence of the person s ownership of Company stock, including the number of shares owned and the length of time of ownership; and 

2. 
 The name of the candidate, the candidate s resume or a listing of his or her qualifications to be a director of the Company and the person s consent to be named as a director if selected by the Nominating Committee and nominated by the Board. 

22 

 Table of Contents 

The stockholder recommendation and information
described above must be sent to the Corporate Secretary at Network CN Inc., Unit 705B, 7th Floor, New East Ocean Centre, 9 Science Museum
Road, TST, KLN, Hong Kong. For a candidate to be considered for nomination by the Nominating Committee at an annual meeting, a stockholder
recommendation must be received not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the Company s most recent annual meeting
of stockholders. 

The Nominating Committee does not have any formal
criteria for director nominees; however, it believes that director nominees should have certain minimum qualifications, including the
highest personal and professional integrity and values, an inquiring and independent mind, practical wisdom and mature judgment. In evaluating
director nominees, the Nominating Committee also considers an individual s skills, character, leadership experience, business experience
and acumen, familiarity with relevant industry issues, national and international experience, and other relevant criteria that may contribute
to our success. This evaluation is performed in light of the skill set and other characteristics that would most complement those
of the current directors, including the diversity, maturity, skills and experience of the board as a whole, with the objective of recommending
a group of persons that can best implement our business plan, develop our business and represent shareholder interests. 

As described above, the Nominating Committee will
consider candidates recommended by shareholders. It will also receive suggestions of candidates from current Board members, the Company s
executive officers or other sources, which may be either unsolicited or in response to requests from the Nominating Committee. 

After a person has been identified by the Nominating
Committee as a potential candidate, the Nominating Committee may collect and review publicly available information regarding the person
to assess whether the person should be considered further. The Nominating Committee members may contact the person if the person should
be considered further. Generally, the Nominating Committee may request information from the candidate, review the person s accomplishments
and qualifications and may conduct one or more interviews with the candidate and members of the committee or other Board members. In certain
instances, Nominating Committee members or other Board members may contact one or more references provided by the candidate or may contact
other members of the business community or other persons that may have first-hand knowledge of the candidate s accomplishments.
The Nominating Committee s evaluation process does not vary based on whether or not a candidate is recommended by a shareholder,
although, as stated above, in the case of such a candidate the Board may take into consideration the number of shares held by the recommending
shareholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. 

Board Oversight of Risk 

Our Board of Directors recognizes that, although
risk management is a primary responsibility of the Company s management, the Board plays a critical role in oversight of risk. The
Board, in order to more specifically carry out this responsibility, has assigned certain task focusing on reviewing different areas including
strategic, operational, financial and reporting, compensation, compliance, corporate governance and other risks to the relevant Board
Committees as summarized above. Each Committee then reports to the full Board ensuring the Board s full involvement in carrying
out its responsibility for risk management.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

 Table of Contents 

Overview 

The Company s executive compensation program
is generally designed to align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders and to reward executives for achieving the
Company s objectives. The executive compensation program is also designed to attract and retain the services of qualified executives. 

All the compensation packages for executive officers
are recommended and proposed by the Remuneration Committee. In determining compensation for executive officers, the Remuneration Committee
considers the officers current compensation, the level of executive compensation packages for similarly situated companies, changes
in cost of living, our financial condition, our operating results and individual performance. However, the full Board of Directors determines
all such compensation packages. 

Executive compensation generally consists of base
salary, bonuses and long-term incentive equity compensation such as stock grants or additional options to purchase shares of the
Company s common stock as well as various health and welfare benefits. The Board has determined that both the base salary and
long-term incentive equity compensation should be the principal component of executive compensation. The Board has not adopted a formal
bonus plan, and all bonuses are discretionary. 

Elements of Compensation 

The executive compensation for (i) the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and (ii) the Company s compensated executive officer who were serving as executive
officers (collectively Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2022 primarily consisted of base salary, long term
incentive equity compensation, income tax reimbursement, and other compensation and benefit programs generally available to other employees, 

Base Salary . The Board establishes base
salaries for the Company s Named Executive Officers based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account competitive
market compensation paid by other companies in the Company s peer group for similar positions. Generally, the Board believes that
executive base salaries should be targeted near the median of the range of salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar
responsibilities at comparable companies in line with our compensation philosophy. 

Base salaries are reviewed annually and may be
adjusted to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and experience. 

Bonuses . Bonuses are intended to compensate
the Named Executive Officers for achieving the Company s financial performance and other objectives established by the Board each
year. The Board currently does not adopt a formal bonus plan and all bonuses are discretionary. 

Long-Term Incentive Equity Compensation .
The Board believes that stock-based awards promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by providing executive officers
with incentives to improve shareholder value and contribute to the success of the Company and by enabling the Company to attract, retain
and reward the best available persons for executive officer positions. The Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive certain number
of shares of common stock of the Company. The Company cannot currently determine the number or type of additional awards that may be granted
to eligible participants under the long-term incentive equity compensation plan in the future. Such determination will be made from time
to time by the Remuneration Committee (or Board). 

Income Tax Reimbursement . Dr. Earnest Leung
were fully reimbursed by the Company for their Hong Kong personal income taxes resulting from their employment under the employment
agreement dated July 15, 2009. 

Change-In-Control and Termination Arrangements .
The employment agreements with current Named Executives may be terminated by giving the other party three-month advanced notice, except
Ms. Shirley Cheng may be terminated with one-month advance notice. Other than as disclosed above, the Company does not have change-in-control
arrangements with any of its current Named Executives, and the Company is not obligated to pay severance or other enhanced benefits to
executive officers, unless otherwise stated in Hong Kong Employment Ordinance, upon termination of their employment.

same date, for their service for fiscal 2021. The shares granted were not yet issued.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. None of our executive officers has served on the Board or Remuneration Committee (or other
committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served on our Board or Remuneration Committee. 

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
of Officers and Directors 

Our bylaws provide for the indemnification of
our present and prior directors and officers or any person who may have served at our request as a director or officer of another corporation
in which we own shares of capital stock or of which we are a creditor, against expenses actually and necessarily incurred by them in connection
with the defense of any actions, suits or proceedings in which they, or any of them, are made parties, or a party, by reason of being
or having been director(s) or officer(s) of us or of such other corporation, in the absence of negligence or misconduct in the performance
of their duties. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditure by us, which we may be unable to recoup.

Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities
arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant
to provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification
is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or
controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling
person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed
in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 

At the present time, there is no pending litigation
or proceeding involving a director, officer, employee or other agent of ours in which indemnification would be required or permitted.
We are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding which may result in a claim for such indemnification.

Equity Incentive Plan 

In April 2004, our Board of Directors and holders
of a majority of our then outstanding common stock authorized and approved the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2004 Plan. Under the
2004 Plan, we reserved 40,000 shares of our common stock for issuance upon exercise of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock
bonuses and rights to purchase awarded from time-to-time, to our officers, directors, employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2016,
26,667 shares have been issued under the plan and 13,333 shares remain available for issuance. No options, warrants or other rights to
acquire shares of our common stock have been granted or are outstanding under the plan. A registration statement on Form S-8 was filed
with the SEC with respect to 26,667 shares of common stock issuable under the plan on April 22, 2004 (SEC File No. 333-114644).

In March 2007, our Board of Directors authorized
and approved the 2007 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, or the 2007 Plan. The purpose of the plan is to promote the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders by providing a means of non-cash remuneration to selected participants who contribute to the operating
progress and earning power of the Company. The plan also provides incentives to employees and directors by offering them an opportunity
to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. Under the 2007 Plan, we reserved 100,000 shares of our common stock for issuance upon
exercise of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock bonuses and rights to purchase awarded from time to time, to our officers,
directors, employees and consultants. A registration statement on Form S-8 was filed with the SEC on April 6, 2007 (SEC File No. 333-141943)
with respect to 100,000 shares of common stock issuable under the 2007 Plan as well as options to purchase 3,000 shares of common stock
issued to the Company s legal counsel in February 2006. Such options were not issued under the 2004 Plan or the 2007 Plan. The Company s
stockholders approved the 2007 Plan in November 2007. 

In July 2009, the Board of Directors approved
the issuance of 493,267 shares in excess of the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, and in accordance
with the 2007 Plan, the Company is required to seek stockholder approval within twelve months after the date of such excess grant. The
Board of Directors has no immediate plans to issue additional shares under the 2007 Plan, however, the Board of Directors believes that
increasing the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2007 Plan will be instrumental for us to continue
to attract and retain outstanding employees. Accordingly, on June 2, 2010, the Board of Directors approved the amendment and
restatement of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the First Amendment of 2007 Plan ), with the only change being to increase
the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value 0.001 per share that may be issued and sold under the 2007 Plan
from 100,000 to 1,426,667 and submitted it for stockholder s approval. A registration statement on Form S-8 was filed with the SEC
on July 30, 2010 (SEC File No. 333-168417) with respect to the First Amendment of 2007 Plan. 

On July 30, 2012, the Board of Directors approved
the second amendment and restatement of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Second Amendment of 2007 Plan ), with the only
change being to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value 0.001 per share that may be issued and
sold under the 2007 Plan from 1,426,667 to 2,093,333, and submitted it for stockholder s approval. The Board of Directors believes
that such arrangements will be instrumental for the Company to be able to continue to attract and retain outstanding employees. A registration
statement on Form S-8 was filed with the SEC on October 12, 2012 (SEC File No. 333-184398) with respect to the Second Amendment of 2007
Plan. 

On October 31, 2012, the Board of Directors approved
the third amendment and restatement of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Third Amendment of 2007 Plan ), with the only
change being to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value 0.001 per share that may be issued and
sold under the 2007 Plan from 2,093,333 to 2,680,000, and submitted it for stockholder s approval. The Board of Directors believes
that such arrangements will be instrumental for us to be able to continue to attract and retain outstanding employees. A registration
statement on Form S-8 was filed with the SEC on January 16, 2014 (SEC File No. 333-193381) with respect to the Third Amendment of 2007
Plan. 

As of December 31, 2022, 2,411,830 shares have
been issued under the plan and 268,170 shares remain available for issuance. Except for the shares granted to directors, no options, warrants
or other rights to acquire shares of our common stock have been granted or are outstanding under the plan. 

On January 20, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized
and approved the 2023 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, or the 2023 Plan. The purpose of the plan is to promote the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders by providing a means of non-cash remuneration to selected participants who contribute to the operating
progress and earning power of the Company. The plan also provides incentives to employees and directors by offering them an opportunity
to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. Under the 2023 Plan, we reserved 20,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance
upon exercise of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock bonuses and rights to purchase awarded from time to time, to our officers,
directors, employees and consultants. On March 22, 2023, our Board of Directors and majority of shareholders approved to amend the 2023
Equity Incentive Plan to decrease the maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company that may be issued and sold from 20,000,000
to 10,000,000. 

Both of the Plans are administered by our Board
of Directors. Under each plan, the Board determines which of our employees, officers, directors and consultants are granted awards, as
well as the material terms of each award, including whether options are to be incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. 

Subject to the provisions of the Plans, and the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to incentive stock options, the Board determines who shall receive awards, the number of shares of
common stock that may be purchased, the time and manner of exercise of options and exercise prices. At its discretion, the Board also
determines the form of consideration to be received upon exercise and may permit the exercise price of options granted under the plans
to be paid in whole or in part with previously acquired shares and/or the surrender of options. The term of options granted under the
plans may not exceed ten years, or five years for an incentive stock option granted to an optionee owning more than 10 of our voting
stock. The exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than 100 of the fair market value of our common stock at the time
the option is granted. However, incentive stock options granted to a 10 holder of our voting stock may not be exercisable at less than
110 of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant. The exercise price for non-qualified options will be determined
by the board.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

Related Party Transactions 

Except as set forth below, during our last two
fiscal years, we have not entered into any material transactions or series of transactions that would be considered material in which
any director or executive officer or beneficial owner of 5 or more of any class of our capital stock, or any immediate family member
of any of the preceding persons, had a direct or indirect material interest: 

In April 2009, in connection with debt restructuring,
Statezone Ltd. of which Dr. Earnest Leung, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a Director (being appointed on July 15, 2009
and May 11, 2009, respectively) was the sole director, provided agency and financial advisory services to the Company. Accordingly, the
Company paid an aggregate service fee of 350,000, of which 250,000 has been recorded as issuance costs for 1 Convertible Promissory
Notes and 100,000 has been recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets, net since April 2009. Such 100,000 is refundable unless
the Keywin Option is exercised and completed. On October 28, 2021, Keywin exercised its option and 100,000 was recorded in general and
administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

On July 1, 2009, the Company and Keywin, of which
the Company s chief executive officer and director is the director and his spouse is the sole shareholder, entered into an Amendment,
pursuant to which the Company agreed to extend the exercise period for the Keywin Option under the Note Exchange and Option Agreement
between the Company and Keywin, to purchase an aggregate of 1,637,522 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 2,000,000,
from a three-month period ended on July 1, 2009, to a six-month period ended October 1, 2009. The exercise period for the Keywin option
was subsequently further extended to a nine-month period ended January 1, 2010, pursuant to the Second Amendment. On January 1, 2010,
the Company and Keywin entered into the third Amendment, pursuant to which the Company agreed to further extend the exercise period to
an eighteen-month period ended on October 1, 2010, and provide the Company with the right to unilaterally terminate the exercise period
upon 30 days written notice. On September 30, 2010, the exercise price was extended at various times from September 1, 2010 to
December 31, 2017 and the Keywin Option was further extended to a hundred and twenty-nine-month period ending on January 1, 2020 and the
exercise price changed to 0.99. On December 31, 2019, the latest exercise period for the Keywin Option was further extended to a hundred
and fifty-three-month period ending on January 1, 2022. On June 1, 2021, the Company and Keywin, of which the Company s chief executive
officer and director is the director and his spouse is the sole shareholder, entered into an Amendment, pursuant to which the Company
agreed Keywin to purchase an aggregate of 11,764,756 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 2,000,000.
The fair value of the purchase option was determined utilizing Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date before the modification
and after modification, accordingly, the Company recorded nil and 3,544,430 as dividend for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. 

On October 28, 2021, Keywin exercised its option
to purchase an aggregate of 11,764,756 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 2,000,000 which
for setting off against the Company s obligation to repay part of the short term loan interest payable, there was no cash proceeds
from the exercise of Keywin option. 

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
recorded an aggregated amount of 1,037,167 and 2,845,006 of short-term loans from a shareholder that the loans are unsecured, bear a
monthly interest of 1.5 and repayable on demand, respectively. However, according to the agreements, the Company shall have the option
to shorten or extend the life of those short-term loans if the need arises and the Company has agreed with the shareholder to extend the
short-term loans on the due date. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded an interest payable recorded in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and other payables of 167,468 and 470,315 , respectively. The interest expenses of the short-term loans for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to 192,247 and 512,101, respectively. 

On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars 2,500,000). The issuance of convertible note is for
setting off against the Company s obligation to repay part of the short-term loan 2,005,000 and interest payable 495,000, there
was no cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes. As of the date of this report, the loan and interest payable balance have
not yet been repaid.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Board of Directors and Shareholders 

 Network CN Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Network CN Inc. (the
 Company as of December 31and 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the related consolidated statements of operations, statement
of stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect
to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has a
net loss of 925,278 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and has a stockholders deficit of 6,337,754 as of December 31, 2022. These
factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to
these matters are also described in note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

the Company common stock for an aggregate purchase price of which for setting off against the Company s

Board of Directors and Majority of stockholders of the Company approved to increase the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock
from to . On October 11, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with

Going Concern 

The Company has net cash used in operating activities
of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has
stockholders deficit of and , respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s plans regarding those concerns are addressed in the following paragraph. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

In response to current financial conditions, the
Company has actively explored new prominent media projects in order to provide a wider range of media and advertising services and improve
our financial performance. If the project can start to operate, the Company expects that the project will improve the Company s
future financial performance. The Company expects that the new project can generate positive cashflow. 

The existing cash and cash equivalents together
with highly liquid current assets are insufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next twelve months. The Company will
need to rely upon some combination of cash generated from the Company s operations, or proceeds from the issuance of the Company s
equity and debt securities as well as the exercise of the conversion option by the Company s note holders to convert the notes to
the Company s common stock, in order to maintain the Company s operations. Based on the Company s best estimates, the
Company believes that there are sufficient financial resources to meet the cash requirements for the coming twelve months and the consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. However, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue
as a going concern. These uncertainties may result in adverse effects on continuation of the Company as a going concern. The accompany
consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

- years 

When equipment is retired or otherwise disposed
of, the related cost, accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment loss, if any, are removed from the respective accounts, and
any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Repairs and maintenance costs on equipment
are expensed as incurred. 

impairment of long-lived assets for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

years 

The Company elected to not separate non-lease
components from the associated lease components and to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term
of twelve months or less. 

. The convertible promissory notes bore interest
at 1 per annum, payable in arrears, matured on , and were convertible at any time into shares of the Company s
common stock at a fixed conversion price of per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. 

The Company determined the 1 convertible promissory
notes to be conventional convertible instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Its embedded conversion option qualified
for equity classification. The 1 convertible promissory notes did not have any embedded conversion option which shall be bifurcated and
separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, nor did they contain a cash conversion feature. The Company accounted for the
Notes in accordance with ASC 470, as a single debt instrument. No beneficial conversion feature (the BCF was recognized
as the set conversion price for the Notes was greater than the fair value of the Company s share price at date of issuance. 

New 1 Convertible Promissory Notes, due in 2027 

On January 18, 2022, the Company entered into
a Subscription Agreement under which the Subscriber agreed to purchase the 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement from the Company
for an agreement purchase price of two million five hundred thousand US Dollars ). On the same date, the Company signed the
with 1 Senior Unsecured Convertible Note Agreement under which the Company may sell and issue to the Subscriber up to an aggregate maximum
amount of in principal amount of Convertible Notes prior to January 19, 2027. The Convertible Promissory Notes issued to the
Investor are convertible at the holder s option into shares of Company common stock at per share. 

The Company evaluates the conversion feature to
determine whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-20. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible
note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible notes payable and may not be settled in cash upon
conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible notes payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance
to the date the notes is due using the effective interest method. If the notes payable are retired prior to the end of their contractual
term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature
is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included
in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment date to be received upon conversion. 

The Company recognize revenue when a customer
obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive
in exchange for such services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: 

1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer -
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party s rights
regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to those goods or services, (ii) the contract
has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred
is probable based on the customer s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer s
ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer s historical payment experience or,
in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. The contract term for contracts
that provide a right to terminate a contract for convenience without significant penalty will reflect the term that each party has enforceable
rights under the contract (the period through the earliest termination date). If the termination right is only provided to the customer,
the unsatisfied performance obligations will be evaluated as customer options as discussed below. 

2) Identify the performance obligations in the
contract - Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the
customer that are both (i) capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together
with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and (ii) are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If these criteria are not met the
promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Certain of our contracts (under which we deliver multiple
promised services) require us to perform integration activities where we bear risk with respect to integration activities. Therefore,
we must apply judgment to determine whether as a result of those integration activities and risks, the promised services are distinct
on the context of the contract. 

We typically do not include options that would
result in a material right. If options to purchase additional services or options to renew are included in customer contracts, we evaluate
the option in order to determine if our arrangement include promises that may represent a material right and needs to be accounted for
as a performance obligation in the contract with the customer. 

3) Determine the transaction price - The transaction
price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
Our contract prices may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or a combination of both fixed and variable amounts. To the extent the
transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction
price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors outside our control that
could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential
reversal of revenue. These estimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required. 

4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract - If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the
single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price
to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets
the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance
obligation. For most performance obligations, we determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation
is sold separately. Although uncommon, if the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone
selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to
the performance obligations. 

5) Recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a
performance obligation: we satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point-in-time as discussed in further detail below.
Revenue is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a
customer. 

The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain
tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. Once this threshold has been met, the Company s measurement of its expected tax benefits is recognized
in its consolidated financial statements. The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. 

Level 2 - Level 2 applies to assets or
liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are
observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 

Level 3 - Level 3 applies to assets or
liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value
of the assets or liabilities. 

The carrying value of the Company s financial
instruments, which consist of cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other payables,
and convertible promissory notes approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities. 

The carrying value of the Company s financial
instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is stated at a value being equal to the allocated proceeds
of convertible promissory notes based on the relative fair value of notes and warrants. In the measurement of the fair value of these
instruments, the Black-Scholes option pricing model is utilized, which is consistent with the Company s historical valuation techniques.
These derived fair value estimates are significantly affected by the assumptions used. As the allocated value of the financial instruments
related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is recorded in additional paid-in capital, the financial instruments
related to warrants were not required to mark to market as of each subsequent reporting period. The carrying value of the Company s
financial instruments related to options is measuring its fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is consistent
with the Company s historical valuation techniques. The fair value of option is recorded as dividend.
