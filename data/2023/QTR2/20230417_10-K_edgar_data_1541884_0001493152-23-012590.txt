Item
1. Business 

We
are a medical technology company with a mission to dramatically improve the cancer landscape with a modern solution for the early detection
of multiple cancers thereby expanding the therapeutic window, significantly improving survivability, and reducing the cost of healthcare.
One in two Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in five will die. Clinical literature shows that early
detection can save lives and money. We operate at the confluence of our Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA) technology or bioimpedance
and artificial intelligence (AI). We are developing an advanced multi-cancer screening technology for early detection of multiple cancers
that may expand the therapeutic window, dramatically improve survivability and reduce the cost of healthcare. We have active projects
in lung, breast and gastro-intestinal (GI) cancers. The first planned product utilizing our proprietary digital platform, the IONIQ ProLung
Test for lung cancer, has been designated a Breakthrough Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020. We submitted our de novo
 application to the U.S. FDA in February 2022 and we received a substantive review from the FDA outlining additional information that
is required for US regulatory clearance. These items include questions and requests related to biocompatibility testing, clinical data,
Indications for Use and labeling, cybersecurity documentation, electrical safety, special controls, human factors and usability, performance
testing, risk analysis, software, sterility and shelf life. We remain fully-committed to gaining U.S. FDA regulatory de novo clearance
and continue to collaborate with the US FDA so that we can satisfy their requests and subsequently commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test
for lung cancer. 

Our
non-invasive, rapid and radiation-free IONIQ ProLung Test developed to assess the risk of malignancy in lung nodules found in the chest
by a Computed Tomography CT scan, which is currently the primary method used in the United States US for
screening lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US and the world according to American Cancer Society
and World Health Organization. Earlier detection makes a substantial improvement in survival in individuals at high risk of lung cancer.
Timely identification of malignancy is essential for patients and their families. Currently, patients often wait from three months to
three and one-half years to have the risk of malignancy assessed through periodic CT scan surveillance. Until malignancy is determined
to be likely, invasive biopsy and treatment are typically delayed. Current statistics reflect an average 17 survival rate at five years
for those diagnosed with lung cancer. 

We
believe the IONIQ ProLung Test, in conjunction with the discovery of a nodule by CT scan, provides a more rapid assessment of the risk
of malignancy, which must be determined prior to biopsy. Since a lung biopsy is invasive and may require life threatening thoracic surgery,
physicians, patients, and insurance companies typically delay biopsy and therapy until the risk of malignancy outweighs the risk of further
diagnostic procedures. For these patients, the delay can reduce the time available to treat the tumor and may cause sustained emotional
trauma. 

The
IONIQ ProLung Test is designed to enable the practitioner to promptly assess the risk of malignancy in patients with lung nodules. The
IONIQ ProLung Test utilizes bioimpedance technology or Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA). Our Bioimpedance technology involves a sequential
scanning process that measures significant differences in electrical conductance between patients with cancerous and benign tissue. We
plan to introduce the IONIQ ProLung Test to the market as a standard predictive analytic test, without the need for transmission of a
physical sample or specimen to a lab for analysis. 

1 

The
IONIQ ProLung Test acquires bioimpedance measurement data by means of a patented probe and disposable diaphoretic or EKG-type electrodes
placed on the patient s back and arms. The IONIQ ProLung Test registers and evaluates measurement data derived from numerous pathways
through the chest and is processed by a predictive analytic algorithm. The results are summarized in a report that can be used by the
physician, in concert with other risk factors such as nodule size, family history, smoking history and gender, to evaluate patients with
nodules. The IONIQ ProLung Test requires minimal preparation and can be completed in about 20 minutes. Most importantly, it guides or
informs the physician s decision making without the time consuming and expensive watchful waiting period. We believe the IONIQ
ProLung Test provides considerable cost savings when compared with today s status quo of patients undergoing repeated CT imaging
studies and potentially unnecessary surgery. 

ProLung
dba IONIQ Sciences owns the intellectual property and established the clinical research plan for the IONIQ ProLung Test. Beginning in
2005, we embarked on clinical research which revealed the potential of our technology. In 2011, our research demonstrated the utility
of the IONIQ ProLung Test in lung cancer patients. To date, more than 1,400 subjects have been tested using the IONIQ ProLung Test at
IONIQ s headquarters and in major cancer centers. If our de novo U.S. FDA clearance is granted, of which there can be no
assurance, we plan to transition the hospitals that participated in our clinical trials to commercial placements of the IONIQ ProLung
Test System and consumable IONIQ ProLung Test kit. 

In
the US, the push for early detection of lung cancer was greatly accelerated in 2013 and again most recently in 2020. Recognizing the
dismal rate of lung cancer survival in the US, and the potential value of early detection, U.S. guidelines were established for lung
cancer CT screening. The guidelines provided for CT screening for lung cancer in asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 80 who have a 20 pack-year
history of smoking and who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the past 15 years. This demographic group addresses a substantial
portion of individuals of high risk of lung cancer. In 2020, the guidelines were expanded effectively doubling the population covered.
The US health care industry has generally recognized the need for technologies that will provide for earlier detection of cancers at
a lower cost. Genetic biomarkers, protein panels, and breath analysis, among others, are in various stages of development. The IONIQ
ProLung Test is the first bioimpedance technology that has been developed for the risk stratification of lung cancer. In February 2015,
the US Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) announced its coverage of lung cancer screening by CT. This newly reimbursed
screening procedure increased the number of individuals with suspicious lung nodules who may be candidates for the IONIQ ProLung Test. 

With
the arrival of lung cancer screening recommendations, the large U.S. market and government-backed reimbursement represent near term opportunities
to accelerate diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer while reducing invasive biopsies and costs. We made U.S. clearance and recognition
of the IONIQ ProLung Test a major priority, targeting lung cancer risk stratification and reducing time to treatment. The IONIQ ProLung
Test has been designated a Breakthrough Medical Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020 based on the clinical trial results from PLW-216
and the ability of the device to detect lung cancer in small lung nodules. We intend to seek government-backed reimbursement after FDA
clearance. We are also interested in improving the cost of diagnosis and treatment with capitated providers. We believe the IONIQ ProLung
Test can be offered at a fraction of the cost of current standard of care, which is repeat periodic imaging studies. 

We
have developed the quality management system, as well as supply chain and the ability to fully manufacture the entire IONIQ System in
our own Salt Lake City facility. We have received ISO 13485 and other clearances and made certain refinements to the intellectual property
that will further our capabilities, especially the development of the underlying predictive analytic algorithm and refinements to various
software and physical components. We have repeatedly expanded our intellectual property (IP) portfolio, completed the development of
the IONIQ ProLung Test and manufacturing of the IONIQ System and embarked upon clinical trials to provide validation to the medical community. 

2 

The
results of the clinical trial of 420 patients from 15 cancer and medical centers across the US, named PL-208, was published in early
2019. The results of another clinical trial of 486 patients from four cancer and medical centers in China, named PLW-216, was published
in late 2019. We believe the results are more solid indicators that our IONIQ ProLung Test is capable of identifying a signal that can
be used to indicate the risk of malignancy in pulmonary nodules by non-invasively measuring their bioconductance biomarker. With the
conclusion of these Studies, the IONIQ Team is eager to turn its focus to validating a number of already identified hardware, software
and data collection improvements designed to strengthen our algorithm s performance and support a future submission to the FDA.
The Company is also in the midst of evaluating a number of potential strategic partnerships to accelerate our development by expanding
our financial and support network. 

In
late 2018, we announced final results of our Repeatability Study, named PL-209. The repeatability study enrolled sixty subjects, 30 male
and 30 female, half of each gender with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, and half with a BMI of 28 or less. Each subject was scanned
twice on Day One and twice on Day Two. All scans were done by the same operator on the same IONIQ System. Fifty-nine subjects produced
evaluable data. Four models (algorithms) were tested. The study was conducted by ProLung. Study objectives included quantifying the effects
of gender, body mass index (BMI), day-to-day subject variability and variability of a single device when volume-averaged thoracic bioconductance
was measured with the IONIQ ProLung Test. The repeatability study addressed several questions regarding use of the IONIQ ProLung Test.
One significant limitation of this study is that no subjects with known pulmonary nodules or malignancy were enrolled. It is unknown
whether pulmonary nodules or malignancy affect the repeatability of the IONIQ ProLung Test. While the study showed statistically significant
variability of approximately 2 when testing the same subject twice on the same day, the clinical impact of this finding is unknown because
it is not anticipated that patients will receive a second test on the same day in clinical use. While we note significant day-to-day
variability when using an earlier model (the algorithm used in the Johns Hopkins Study, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, 2012 ), repeatability
is markedly improved when using a more refined model. 

In
late 2019, we announced the final results of our Validation Study, named PLW-216. The validation study enrolled 486 subjects from four
leading cancer and medical centers in China. The results were 84 sensitivity and 73 specificity in the 418 subjects included in the
analysis. 

In
February 2020, the FDA designated the IONIQ ProLung Test a Breakthrough Device. Through the Breakthrough Device program, the FDA will
provide ProLung with expedited reviews. This is not a marketing clearance. 

PL-209
Study Conclusions 

1. 
 Same-day
 variability is statistically significant (average second score is 0.0214 points lower), but the clinical impact of this finding is
 unclear. 
 
 2. 
 Day-to-day
 variability is impacted by the model (algorithm) chosen. One particular model with age (model 1b+age) has an ICC=0.958, indicating
 it is very repeatable. 
 
 3. 
 Gender
 and BMI do not affect test performance. 
 
 4. 
 Average
 test time is 18.5 minutes, with a range of 15-24 minutes. 
 
 5. 
 The
 test is well tolerated and agreeable to test subjects. 

PL-208
Study (2012-2019) 

Three
Validation studies have been completed for the IONIQ ProLung Test. The first is PL-208 which enrolled 420 patients across 15 US centers
(ID: NCT01566682). This study was two-phased, with a 200-patient open-labelled training set to test and optimize an algorithm, followed
by testing of the optimized algorithm on the diagnosis-blinded 174-patient validation set. Forty-six (46) subjects (11 were excluded
for being lost to follow up or having an inconclusive diagnosis, missing or inadequate device data. The predictive algorithm utilized
the patient s bioconductance measurements coupled with the patient s age and a binary cut-off point of 0.5 was chosen to
distinguish between high and low likelihood of cancer. The algorithm was locked and applied to a blinded validation set of 174 patients
and yielded a Sensitivity of 69 Specificity of 49 , Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 70 , Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 47 and
overall Accuracy of 61 . 

3 

PLW-208
Study (2015-2016) 

The
second validation trial (PLW-208) was completed by the Company s licensor (ProLung Wuxi). This study enrolled 138 subjects at 2
centers in China. This study was similar in design to the US PL-208 Study and obtained a Sensitivity of 77 , Specificity of 60 , PPV
of 82 , NPV of 41 and an Accuracy of 73 . In reviewing this study, the Sponsor determined that test method and operator training needed
to be improved to obtain better results. 

PLW-216
Study (2017-2019) 

Ultimately,
the Study Sponsor (ProLung Wuxi) improved the device operator training, test method and device predictive algorithm. The Sponsor concluded
the PLW-208 Study and initiated PLW-216, utilizing improved training, test method and a modified locked predictive algorithm. This PLW-216
Study was a single-phase validation study whereby the predictive algorithm was locked prior to the first patient being enrolled and the
IONIQ ProLung Test results were provided to site investigators prior to knowing the subject s actual diagnosis. The PLW-216 Study
enrolled 486 subjects in China at 4 centers led by Dr. Bai, the Chair of the Chinese Alliance against lung Cancer and Director of the
Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute (ID: NCT 02726633, registration No 20170226). The Validation Study demonstrated improved performance
yielding a Sensitivity of 84 Specificity of 73 , Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 78 , Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 80 and
overall Accuracy of 79 from the US Study PL-208 (ID NCT0156668). This performance is comparable to other diagnostic cancer devices such
as Mammogram (~sensitivity of 75 , specificity of 71 and was demonstrated in a large sample size of 418 subjects included in the final
analysis. 

PL-210
- ProLung Test Measurement Collection Protocols for Label Expansion (Ongoing NCT04134520) 

The
purpose of this Study is to identify and test different data collection methods to determine which approaches may be useful in evaluation
additional cancers to lung cancer (including breast cancer) and improve the ProLung Testing procedure. Once this Study is complete, the
Sponsor plans to evaluate these improvements in future follow up cancer validation studies that will assess device accuracy using the
new measurement collection methods.

Chinese and other international markets. 

Lung
Cancer Market Summary 

According
to the American Cancer Society ACS ), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the
US; about one out of four cancer deaths in the US are from lung cancer. The ACS estimates that in 2017 more people in the United States
will die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. 

According
to the World Health Organization WHO ), lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide and is estimated
to be responsible for nearly one in five cancer related deaths. The overall ratio of mortality to incidence is 87 . Each year there are
over 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer worldwide, as well as nearly 1.6 million deaths. The lifetime chance of developing lung cancer
is 1:17 in women and 1:14 in men. 

Until
recently, asymptomatic lung cancer was detected only incidentally when looking for something else. Currently, a lung cancer screen now
reimbursed by Medicare, is performed by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). This has led to a dramatic increase in number of individuals
with lung nodules detected, which is intensifying the need for a risk stratification test such as the IONIQ ProLung Test. 

Lung
cancer patients face median five-year survival rates of only 17 (compared to 89 for breast cancer and 98 for prostate cancer). Survival
rates of lung cancer lags behind that of other cancer rates due to a lack of early and effective detection, and a challenging biopsy.
A significant amount of time is required to assess the risk under current guidelines. Should innovation reduce the time required for
assessing the risk of malignancy, lung cancer mortality could approach that of other cancer rates. In those instances when lung cancer
was detected in its earliest stage, the five-year survival improves to 80 or approximately an improvement of five times.

Lung
Cancer Screening: 

Given
the size of the US market and the progression of CT scan use in early detection, clearance and acceptance of the IONIQ ProLung Test in
the US is the major priority. The CDC estimates that there are 94 million Americans at risk of lung cancer (which includes current and
former smokers). In the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial of 53,454 patients, approximately 24 of the CT scans performed were positive
revealing a lung nodule suspicious for lung cancer that required follow-up. CT screening was recommended by the US Preventive Services
Task Force on December 31, 2013, and Medicare began to pay for lung cancer screening on February 5, 2016. Based on these estimates, if
the approximately 94 million Americans at risk for lung cancer received a low dose CT screen approximately 24 (or 23 million) Americans
may reveal lung nodules requiring follow up. We believe these patients would be eligible to receive the IONIQ ProLung Test.

European
Market 

IONIQ
Sciences plans to pursue a CE mark in conjunction with US marketing clearance in the European Union and European Free Trade Association
Countries, which represents approximately 513 million individuals and 28-member states. Europe has some of the highest smoking prevalence
of any region in the world which has led to a high incidence of lung cancer. In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 268,000
individuals died from lung cancer and that more than 313,000 cases were diagnosed in the European Union.

is estimated that 28 of Europeans smoke and approximately 133 million individuals are at high-risk of lung cancer. Applying the US rates
in the published National Lung Screening Trial (2011), over 30 million of these individuals are estimated to have an indeterminate lung
nodule and require follow-up to determine the risk of malignancy. As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues
to increase in Europe, risk stratification tools such as the IONIQ ProLung Test are needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule
and the determination of malignancy. 

China
Market 

IONIQ
Sciences plans to enter the China market through its licensee (ProLung China). According to the World Health Organization, the number
of smokers in China is steadily growing and increasing at higher rates than any other world region. One in three of the world s
cigarettes is smoked in China. The average Chinese smoker consumes 22 cigarettes per day. This is nearly a 50 increase from 1980. Overall,
more cigarettes are smoked in China than in the next top 29 cigarette-consuming countries combined. Lung cancer is epidemic in China
with 653,000 cases in 2012 and an estimated 597,000 deaths. 

The
government s smoking cessation campaign and interventions are poorly funded and weakly enforced, and certain provincial governments
are somewhat dependent upon state-owned tobacco sales and taxation. However, China s Government is collaborating with pulmonology
and radiology leadership to study low-dose CT screening for earlier detection of lung cancer. The government has also sponsored economic
studies to investigate the reimbursement of lung cancer screening in the health insurance system. 

As
the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues to increase in China, risk stratification tools, such as the IONIQ
ProLung Test will be needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy. This clinical need for
risk stratification may be multiplied if a lung cancer screening program is implemented in the Chinese healthcare system. 

Competition 

The
development and commercialization of new products to improve the accuracy and efficiency of risk stratification of lung cancer is competitive,
and we expect considerable competition from major medical device companies, laboratory biomarker tests, and academic institutions that
are conducting research in lung cancer. Extensive research and financial resources have been invested in the discovery and development
of new lung cancer detection tests. Potential competing technologies include, but are not limited to, breath markers, sputum cytology,
DNA-related markers, blood markers, radiography and CT imaging. 

The
timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors products may be an important competitive factor.
We believe the speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical trials and clearance processes, and supply commercial quantities
to market are important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors
including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement, and patent position. We believe that our IONIQ ProLung
Test is superior or equivalent to existing alternatives in these areas, other than availability (in the US due to lack of FDA clearance)
and reimbursement.

Business 

IONIQ
ProLung Test 

The
IONIQ ProLung Test is comprised of the following two components: 

IONIQ
 System - Each system, which will be sold to the customer, consists of the probe, scanner, tower, monitor, and keyboard which
 are all medical grade components available for sale in multiple languages. The pricing of the IONIQ System may vary upon the volume
 of the IONIQ ProLung Test Kits that a customer buys. We refer to the IONIQ System internally as capital equipment or the razor
 handle in the ubiquitous razor/razor blade sales analogy. 

IONIQ
 ProLung Test Kit IONIQ ProLung Test Kit sales should provide near term and continual cash flow. Each single-use, disposable,
 IONIQ ProLung Test Kit is sold in a nonsterile envelope that displays a unique identifier code that is required for access to a IONIQ
 ProLung Test Report, together with all the components necessary to assure precision test performance, patient comfort and hygiene.
 Each IONIQ ProLung Test Kit includes six diaphoretic electrodes, one probe tip and one moistening sponge. Initially, ProLung plans
 to sell the IONIQ ProLung Test Kit for approximately 400 each, available in boxes of 10 and 40. We refer to the IONIQ ProLung Test
 internally as the disposable component or the razor blade in the ubiquitous razor/razor blade sales analogy. 

IONIQ
Sciences novel Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA) or bioimpedance technology simultaneously considers data from multiple measurement
pathways and utilizes a patented predictive analytic algorithm to combine the individual measurements into a weighted average composite
score that indicates an increased or decreased risk of malignancy in the individual in which the nodule has been detected. No images
are generated by the IONIQ ProLung Test and extensive training is not required to interpret the composite score. 

If
required regulatory clearances are received, the IONIQ ProLung Test will be introduced to the market as a standard predictive analytic
test without the need for transmission of a physical sample or specimen. Instead, the IONIQ ProLung Test acquires bioimpedance measurement
data by means of a patented probe and disposable diaphoretic electrodes placed on the back and hands. The data containing precision measurements
is processed by a patented predictive analytic algorithm and a report is generated that may be used by the physician in addition to other
risk factors, such as nodule size, family history, smoking history, and gender to evaluate patients with suspicious lesions identified
by CT scan. The IONIQ ProLung Test is non-invasive, rapid and non-radiating. It requires minimal patient preparation and can be completed
in about 20 minutes. 

The
IONIQ ProLung Test Procedure 

1. 
 IONIQ
 ProLung Test System is connected to the probe, to the electrode cables, and to the power supply. Following a brief power-on sequence,
 the IONIQ ProLung Test completes a self-diagnostic test. 

2. 
 The
 patient is seated. 

3. 
 IONIQ
 ProLung Test kit is opened and removed from its tamper-proof packaging. 

4. 
 Single-use
 diaphoretic electrodes are placed at sites on the patient s back and arms. 

5. 
 Session
 data is entered including technician name, physician name, report delivery method and patient data. 

6. 
 Testing
 begins, as prompted by the device, by applying the probe to acquire measurement data from sites on the chest, shoulders and arms. 

7. 
 IONIQ
 System monitors the acquisition of real-time data. Should re-measurement be required, the device provides visual and audible notification
 that it has not received usable data. 

Research
and Clinical Trial Results 

Our
IONIQ ProLung Test has been evaluated in seven clinical trials at 25 clinical sites with 1,400 subjects. We made modifications to the
IONIQ ProLung Test throughout the research process and will continue to attempt to improve its performance. A description of each clinical
trial is below: 

7 

Proof
of Principle McHenry, IL (2005) 

Description.
 A blinded single-site study of 36 subjects was designed to detect differences in bioelectrical impedance measurements between
 biopsy-confirmed lung cancer subjects and age- and gender-matched control subjects. The trial was configured as a sequential design
 consisting of three individual cohorts. Following the completion of each cohort, the data was evaluated for the presence of a predictive
 model which would discriminate between the lung cancer patients and control subjects. 

Results.
 The First Cohort of 12 subjects could not be utilized for statistical analysis because of an incorrectly calibrated device. An
 algorithm or predictive model was derived in the Second Cohort of 14 patients which fully discriminated between lung cancer patients
 and healthy volunteers. 

Subsequent
 analysis of the Third Cohort offered potentially confounding results, but ProLung felt the hypothesis of feasibility of the device
 had been successfully demonstrated and that sufficient evidence of feasibility existed to proceed with further research. 

Reliability
and Repeatability Salt Lake City, UT (2006) 

Description.
 A single-site study to evaluate the variability of the IONIQ ProLung Test in 22 healthy volunteers. 

Results.
 Measurement variables evaluated were the maximum and minimum conductance. The maximum and minimum conductance values obtained
 from one operator making repeated measurements with the same device on volunteer subjects over two days of testing were comparable,
 with slightly lower standard deviations for maximum conductance readings and extremely high reliability indices for both measures.
 For both data sets, the same measurement points were found to have minimal variability (and maximal reliability) indices. The Electro
 Pulmonary Nodule Scan showed a reliability index of 0.99 and a correlation between device replicates of 0.98. 

Algorithm
Development Study a.k.a. FML-204 Baltimore, MD (2012) 

Description .
 This single arm, single site algorithm finding and internal validation trial was designed to derive an algorithm for lung cancer
 detection in subjects with suspicious lung nodules. 

Results.
 Final results included the identification of an algorithm capable of 90 sensitivity (correctly identifying 26 of 29 malignant
 masses), 92 specificity (correctly identifying 11 of 12 non-malignant masses), and Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC area (combined sensitivity and specificity) of 90 (correctly identifying 37 of 41 patients overall). Final results were presented
 in 2011 at the World Conference of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and at the Annual Congress of the European
 Respiratory Society and were published in the April 2012 edition of the Journal of Thoracic Oncology. 

Though
 not part of the original study, a subsequent subset analysis was performed on Study subjects
 who had indeterminate results on FDG-PET scans (n=7). In this subset (3 benign, 4 malignant)
 the IONIQ ProLung Test correctly predicted the risk of malignancy in the index nodule being
 assessed. These results were presented at the International Association for the Study of
 Lung Cancer World Congress in Denver, CO, in September 2015 and published in volume 10, number
 9, Supplement 2, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, p. S305). 

Repeatability
a.k.a. PL-209 Salt Lake City, Utah (2015) 

Description .
 The repeatability study enrolled sixty subjects, 30 male and 30 female, half of each gender with a body mass index (BMI)
 of 30 or more, and half with a BMI of 28 or less. Each subject was scanned twice on Day One and twice on Day Two. All scans were
 done by the same operator on the same IONIQ System. Fifty-nine subjects produced evaluable data. Four models (algorithms) were tested.
 The study was conducted by ProLung. Study objectives included quantifying the effects of gender, body mass index (BMI), day-to-day
 subject variability and variability of a single device when volume-averaged thoracic bioconductance was measured with the IONIQ ProLung
 Test. 

8 

Final
 Results. (1) Same-day variability is statistically significant (average second score is 0.0214 points lower), but the clinical
 impact of this finding is unclear (2) Day-to-day variability is impacted by the model (algorithm) chosen. One particular model with
 age (model 1b+age) has an ICC=0.958, indicating it is very repeatable. (3) Gender and BMI do not affect test performance. (4) Average
 test time is 18.5 minutes, with a range of 15-24 minutes. (5) The test is well tolerated and agreeable to test subjects. The repeatability
 study addressed several questions regarding use of the IONIQ ProLung Test. One significant limitation of this study is that no subjects
 with known pulmonary nodules or malignancy were enrolled. It is unknown whether pulmonary nodules or malignancy affect the repeatability
 of the IONIQ ProLung Test. While the study showed statistically significant variability of approximately 2 when testing the same
 subject twice on the same day, the clinical impact of this finding is unknown because it is not anticipated that patients will receive
 a second test on the same day in clinical use. While we note significant day-to-day variability when using an earlier model (the
 algorithm used in the Johns Hopkins Study, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, 2012), repeatability is markedly improved when using a more
 refined model. 

PL-208
Study (2012-2019) 

Description .
 Three Validation studies have been completed for the IONIQ ProLung Test. The first is PL-208 which enrolled 420 patients
 across 15 US centers (ID: NCT01566682). This study was two-phased, with a 200-patient open-labelled training set to test and optimize
 an algorithm, followed by testing of the optimized algorithm on the diagnosis-blinded 174-patient validation set. Forty-six (46)
 subjects (11 were excluded for being lost to follow up or having an inconclusive diagnosis, missing or inadequate device data.
 The predictive algorithm utilized the patient s bioconductance measurements coupled with the patient s age and a binary
 cut-off point of 0.5 was chosen to distinguish between high and low likelihood of cancer. 

Final
 Results. The algorithm was locked and applied to a blinded validation set of 174 patients and yielded a Sensitivity of 69 Specificity
 of 49 , Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 70 , Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 47 and overall Accuracy of 61 . 

PLW-208
Study (2015-2016) 

Description .
 The second validation trial (PLW-208) was completed by the Company s licensor (ProLung Wuxi). This study enrolled 138
 subjects at 2 centers in China. 

Final
 Results. This study was similar in design to the US PL-208 Study and obtained a Sensitivity of 77 , Specificity of 60 , PPV of
 82 , NPV of 41 and an Accuracy of 73 . In reviewing this study, the Sponsor determined that test method and operator training needed
 to be improved to obtain better results. 

PLW-216
Study (2017-2019) 

Description .
 Ultimately, the Study Sponsor (ProLung Wuxi) improved the device operator training, test method and device predictive algorithm.
 The Sponsor concluded the PLW-208 Study and initiated PLW-216, utilizing improved training, test method and a modified locked predictive
 algorithm. This PLW-216 Study was a single-phase validation study whereby the predictive algorithm was locked prior to the first
 patient being enrolled and the IONIQ ProLung Test results were provided to site investigators prior to knowing the subject s
 actual diagnosis. The PLW-216 Study enrolled 486 subjects in China at 4 centers led by Dr. Bai, the Chair of the Chinese Alliance
 against lung Cancer and Director of the Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute (ID: NCT 02726633, registration No 20170226). 

Final
 Results. The Validation Study demonstrated improved performance yielding a Sensitivity of 84 Specificity of 73 , Positive Predictive
 Value (PPV) of 78 , Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 80 and overall Accuracy of 79 from the US Study PL-208 (ID NCT0156668).
 This performance is comparable to other diagnostic cancer devices such as Mammogram (~sensitivity of 75 , specificity of 71 and
 was demonstrated in a large sample size of 418 subjects included in the final analysis.

Other
Research 

PL-210
- ProLung Test Measurement Collection Protocols for Label Expansion (Ongoing NCT04134520) 

The
purpose of this Study is to identify and test different data collection methods to determine which approaches may be useful in evaluation
additional cancers to lung cancer (including breast cancer) and improve the ProLung Testing procedure. Once this Study is complete, the
Sponsor plans to evaluate these improvements in future follow up cancer validation studies that will assess device accuracy using the
new measurement collection methods. Preliminary results showing the feasibility of the IONIQ technology to detect breast cancer have
been published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Journal (IEEE) in November of 2021. 

Mexico.
 In 2011, ProLung supported a study with a hospital located in Mexico City. The study was administered by ProLung s partner
who was pursuing a joint venture license for the Mexico territory. The partner eventually abandoned the study. After receiving preliminary
test results, ProLung had reason to question the quality of the data being gathered and withdrew its support of the study. 

China.
 We issued a license to an entity conducting research in China in 2013. Their 486 patient Validation Study (PLW-216) using the ProLung
technology was completed in 2019. In August 2019, ProLung announced that it amended the ProLung China license. The third addendum supports
an expanded full collaboration business relationship wherein Prolung China Co. Prolung China and subsidiary (ProLung
Biotech Wuxi) agree to provide all ProLung Biotech Wuxi Know-How and Improvements and clinical data which are used in Clinical Trials
in China (PLW-208 and PLW-216) to ProLung, and other matters. 

Italy
and Switzerland. Four centers in Italy and one center in Switzerland conducted research with the IONIQ ProLung Test under the direction
of local clinicians. Subject enrollment at these sites did not conform to research protocols utilized by ProLung. In addition, this prior
research did not include IONIQ s current measurement method and algorithm improvements. The results of these studies were presented
in the World Congress of Thoracic Imaging and American Thoracic Society conferences. 

At
two other sites, Geneva and Florence, additional physician-sponsored research was conducted. It is not known whether these sites conducted
research with the IONIQ ProLung Test that was compliant with Good Clinical Practice or whether these patients conformed with the IONIQ
ProLung Test patient selection criteria. However, in June 2017, at the World Congress of Thoracic Imaging the Geneva site posted results
indicating Test sensitivity of 66 and a specificity of 66 . The positive predictive value was 94 and negative predictive value was
20 . Geneva researchers concluded the IONIQ ProLung Test could lower the need for invasive biopsies, especially in high-risk patients.
The small number of patients (n=27) precludes definitive conclusions. 

Similarly,
at a center in Florence, Italy, a study looked at 22 subjects undergoing the IONIQ ProLung Test and PET CT scans. They reported a sensitivity
of 75 and a specificity of 50 , with a positive predictive value of 94 and a negative predictive value of 17 . Researchers concluded
that the high positive predictive value of the IONIQ ProLung Test suggested utility in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules,
adding that further research was warranted. This was presented in the form of a poster at the 2017 American Thoracic Society (ATS) Conference.

Governmental
Regulations 

Our
business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of
the environment, health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or
the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations
are subject to change, or new laws may be enacted. 

Both
federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened
civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers
to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret
these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations most relevant to our business. 

US
Food and Drug Administration regulation of medical devices. 

The
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation
of medical devices intended for human use. Our products include medical devices that are subject to these, as well as other federal,
state, local and foreign, laws and regulations. The FDA is responsible for enforcing most of the federal laws and regulations governing
medical devices in the United States. 

The
FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes - Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on their level of risk and the types
of controls that are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment is a factor in determining the type of
premarket submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the United States. We currently anticipate that
the IONIQ System will be classified as a Class II de novo medical device. 

12 

Class
 I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to
 general controls -e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing
 practices, labeling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all three classes of medical
 devices. 

Class
 II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance
 of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and special controls -e.g., special
 labeling, compliance with industry standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA
 clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification 510(k) process. 

The
 de novo application process provides a pathway to Class I or II classification for medical devices for which general controls
 or general and special controls provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is no legally marketed
 predicate device. 

Class
 III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, for a use that is of substantial
 importance in preventing impairment of human health, present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or are not substantially
 equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient
 and for which there is insufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
 Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require FDA clearance of a premarket approval PMA application before marketing. 

Unless
it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially
marketed, distributed or sold in the United States. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance
and PMA. 

510(k)
pathway 

The
510(k)-review process compares a new device to a legally marketed device. Through the 510(k) process, the FDA determines whether a new
medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device (i.e., predicate device) that is not subject to
PMA requirements. Substantial equivalence means that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device,
and either the same or similar technological characteristics as the predicate device, or if there are differences in technological characteristics,
the differences do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate, and the information submitted
in the 510(k) demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. 

To
obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a 510(k)-application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that its
proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. These data generally include non-clinical performance
testing (e.g., software validation, animal testing, electrical safety testing), but clinical data may also be required. Typically, it
takes six to twelve months for the FDA to complete its review of a 510(k) submission; however, it can take significantly longer and clearance
is never assured. During its review of a 510(k), the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly
prolong the review process. After completing its review of a 510(k), the FDA may issue an order, in the form of a letter, that finds
the device to be either (1) substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the United States, or (2) not substantially
equivalent and states that device cannot be marketed in the United States. Depending upon the reason(s) for the not substantially equivalent
finding, the device may need to be approved through the PMA pathway (discussed below) prior to commercialization. 

After
a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that
would constitute a major change in its intended use, including significant modifications to any products or procedures, requires a new
submission and clearance of a new 510(k). The FDA relies on each manufacturer to make and document its determination that a new 510(k)
is (or is not) required, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination. If we are
granted an initial 510(k), we may make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees
with our determination regarding whether a new 510(k) clearance was required for these modifications, we may need to cease marketing
and/or recall the modified device. The FDA may also subject us to other enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, issuing a
warning letter or untitled letter to us, seizing our products, imposing civil penalties, or initiating criminal prosecution. 

13 

De
novo pathway 

If,
at the end of the FDA review of a 510(k), the FDA determines that a device is Not Substantially Equivalent NSE due to the unavailability of a predicate device, a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions
of safety and effectiveness, the FDA may indicate that the device may be suitable for review under the de novo classification
process. If the FDA believes general controls or general and special controls may provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness,
the FDA may indicate in the NSE letter that the product may be appropriate for the de novo classification process under section
513(f)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FD C Act ). Inclusion of this language within an NSE letter does
not indicate that sufficient information currently exists to support a successful de novo request, but simply indicates that given
the risk profile of the device, it seems reasonable that de novo classification may be appropriate. 

Alternatively,
if a manufacturer believes their device is appropriate for classification into Class I or Class II and has determined, based on currently
available information, there is no legally marketed predicate device, they may submit a de novo request without a preceding 510(k)
and NSE. 

Once
a de novo request is received (regardless of whether it is preceded by a 510(k) and NSE determination), the FDA will also check
that the content of the de novo request includes the information required by section 513(f)(2) of the FD C Act. De novo
 requests that lack information to determine whether a potential predicate device exists may be placed on hold. If the de novo
 request is missing information and/or data necessary to determine whether general controls or general and special controls can provide
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA may issue an additional information (AI) letter or request information via
interactive review. If the de novo requestor fails to provide a complete response within 180 calendar days of the date of the
AI request, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn. If a de novo request is withdrawn due to failure
to submit adequate information, a new de novo request is required in order to reinitiate review of the device under the de
novo classification process. 

If
the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request. If a de novo request is granted, the FDA
will issue you a written order granting the de novo request and identifying the classification of the device (either class I or
class II). For class II devices, the FDA will also identify the applicable special controls. Effective on the date of the granting order,
the requester may immediately begin marketing the device subject to the general controls and any identified special controls. The device
may be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions as appropriate. 

Premarket
approval pathway 

Unlike
the comparative standard of the 510(k) pathway, the PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness
of a device. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination
by the FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended
use(s). A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted
on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process. 

After
a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180
days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, the review time is normally longer (e.g., 1-3 years). During this review period,
the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory
panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations
to the FDA as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition,
the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant s establishment to ensure compliance with the Quality
System Regulation QSR ), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture,
packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices. 

14 

Based
on its review, the FDA may (1) issue an order approving the PMA, (2) issue a letter stating the PMA is approvable (e.g.,
minor additional information is needed), (3) issue a letter stating the PMA is not approvable, or (4) issue an order denying
PMA. A company may not market a device subject to PMA review until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval
(or 510(k) clearance), the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device
including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional
clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval (or clearance) can result in materially adverse enforcement action,
including withdrawal of the approval (or clearance). 

Most
modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labeling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before
being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA
supplement and the FDA s time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification. 

Clinical
trials 

FDA
generally prohibits the shipping and marketing of medical devices in the absence of a premarket clearance or approval (where required).
However, the FDA s Investigational Device Exemption IDE regulation exempts the provision of devices for use in
certain types of clinical trials i.e., clinical trials to collect safety and effectiveness data for investigational devices,
and clinical trials evaluating new intended uses and/or certain modifications to a legally marketed device from this prohibition.
This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified
investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed
consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc. 

Clinical
trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance
in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or that otherwise present
a serious risk to the health, safety, and welfare of a subject) require FDA and Institutional Review Board IRB approval
prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is requested through submission of an IDE application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk NSR ), devices (i.e. devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) do not require FDA
approval but do require IRB approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination
of whether a clinical study is significant risk or NSR; however, a reviewing IRB and/or FDA may review this decision and disagree with
the determination. 

An
IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as nonclinical performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing
that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance
that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place
a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable
health risk. 

As
noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post market setting. 

The
collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. The FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post
market surveillance study for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved. 

Pervasive
and continuing FDA regulation 

After
a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally
apply. These include, but are not limited to: 

Establishment
 registration and device listing requirements; 

QSR,
 which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage,
 installation, and servicing of finished devices; 

15 

Labeling
 requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and when fully implemented, will generally
 require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier UDI ), and which also prohibit
 the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., off-label, uses; 

Medical
 Device Reporting MDR ), regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device
 may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a
 death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 

Reports
 of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report
 to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health
 posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable. 
 
 The
 FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements
 can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions: 

Notice
 of inspectional observations; 

Untitled
 letters or warning letters; 

Fines,
 injunctions and civil penalties; 

Recall
 or seizure of our products; 

Operating
 restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

Refusing
 our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 

Withdrawing
 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 

Criminal
 prosecution. 

We
are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance
with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers facilities. 

Marketing
Approvals Outside the United States 

Sales
of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to
country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval,
and the requirements may differ. 

Europe 

Under
the European Union Medical Device Regulation, or EU MDR, medical devices must meet the EU MDR requirements and receive a CE marking certification
prior to marketing in the European Union, or EU. CE marking is the uniform labeling system of products designed to facilitate the supervision
and control of the EU concerning manufacturers compliance with the various regulations and directives of the EU and to clarify
the obligations imposed in the various legislative provisions in the EU. Use of a uniform product labeling indicates compliance with
all the directives and regulations required for the application of such labeling, and it is effective as a manufacturer s declaration
that the product meets the required criteria and technical specifications of the relevant authorities such as health, safety, and environmental
protection. CE marking ensures free trade between the EU and European Free Trade Association countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein,
and Norway) and permits the enforcement and customs authorities in European countries not to allow the marketing of similar products
that do not bear the CE marking sign. Such certification allows, among other things, marking the products (according to various categories)
with the CE marking and their sale and marketing in the EU. 

16 

CE
marking certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, comprehensive technical documentation and data on the product,
which are then reviewed by a Notified Body, or NB. An NB is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states
to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the EU MDR requirements and to grant the CE marking if we, and our
product, comply with specified terms. After receiving the CE marking, we must pass a review carried out by the competent NB annually,
under which it audits our facilities to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 quality system standard. 

Compliance
with the ISO 13485 standard, for medical device quality management systems, is required for regulatory purposes. ISO standards are recognized
international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries
are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical
reports for all our product candidates, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the
registration requirements. 

China 

China s
medical device market, currently in a rapid state of expansion, is overseen by the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA
(formerly the China Food and Drug Administration). The NMPA issues registration certificates required for all medical devices sold in
China. The NMPA uses a risk-based system, and its approval process requires mandatory testing for Class II and III devices. Class II
devices are moderate-risk devices and Class III devices are high-risk medical devices. Third-party review of devices is currently not
allowed in China; only the NMPA is authorized to approve devices. The registration process requires the submission of a registration
standard along with device samples for testing. Manufacturers of Class II and Class III medical devices are also required to demonstrate
that the device has been approved by the country of origin with documents like a CE certificate, 510(k) letter and PMA approval and compliance
with ISO 13485, and they may also be required to submit clinical data in support of their application. In addition to these requirements,
all medical device manufacturers must also include product information in Chinese on all packaging and labeling. Manufacturers exporting
medical devices to China must appoint several China-based agents to act on their behalf. These include a registration agent to coordinate
the NMPA registration process, a legal agent to handle any adverse events reported with a registered device, including a product recall,
and an after-sales agent to provide technical service and maintenance support. 

Other
Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In
the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to
the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector
General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and
state and local governments. These regulations include: 

the
 federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting,
 receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in
 cash or in kind, in return for referring an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service
 for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, or in return for the purchasing, leasing,
 ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item, for which payment
 may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

federal
 false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
 claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government
 may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law
 or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws; 

the
 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 fraud and abuse provisions, which prohibit executing a scheme
 to defraud any healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or making false
 statements or concealing a material fact relating to payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; 

17 

the
 Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations,
 require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare,
 Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments
 or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request
 of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests
 held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

state
 law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services
 reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and
 often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

In
addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct
our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy,
security and transmission of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA s privacy and security standards
directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or
obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new
tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and
possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts
to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition,
state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant
ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 Post-Marketing
Regulations 

Following
approval of a new product, a company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state
regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities
of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling
and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for
direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting for uses or in patient populations not described in the product s approved
labeling (known as off-label use ), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements
for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers
may not market or promote such off label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture
are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review
process. 

Other
Regulatory Matters 

Manufacturing,
sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in
addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety Health Administration, the Environmental Protection
Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state
fraud and abuse laws. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration,
additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal
and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

The
distribution of medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing,
storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of medical device products. 

18 

Our
Marketing Process 

We
must receive separate regulatory approvals from the FDA and equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries for each of the devices before
we can sell them commercially in the US or internationally. We cannot make the claims necessary to market any of our product candidates
until we have completed the requirements for regulatory authorization. We do not know whether regulatory authorities will grant authorization
for any of the products that we, our marketing partners, or distribution partners will develop. 

A
summary of the status of our marketing authorizations in the key initial markets we have identified is set forth below: 

United
 States. The first planned product utilizing our proprietary digital platform, the IONIQ ProLung Test for lung cancer,
 has been designated a Breakthrough Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020. We submitted our de novo application to the U.S.
 FDA in February 2022 and we received a substantive review from the FDA outlining additional information that is required for US regulatory
 clearance. These items include questions and requests related to biocompatibility testing, clinical data, Indications for Use and
 labeling, cybersecurity documentation, electrical safety, special controls, human factors and usability, performance testing, risk
 analysis, software, sterility and shelf life. We remain fully committed to gaining U.S. FDA regulatory de novo clearance and
 continue to collaborate with the US FDA so that we can satisfy their requests and subsequently commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test
 for lung cancer. 

China.
 The NMPA (previously known as the SFDA) roughly follows the FDA model and is the source
 of clearance for the marketing and sale of medical devices in China. To be sold in China,
 medical devices must be registered with Chinese health authorities. In February 2014, the
 Company s licensor in China received clearance to manufacture the device from the Beijing
 government. Additional clearances are required to market and sell the device in this market. 

After
each respective regulatory clearance is obtained, the next step in each of these markets is for insurance companies or government agencies,
as applicable, to agree to reimburse providers for the IONIQ ProLung Test. We have not commenced this process in the US or any other
market, as we do not yet have marketing authorizations. 

Manufacturing
Requirements 

As
a manufacturer of medical devices, we must comply with the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations established by the
FDA. These requirements are meant to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. We maintain a quality management system that
includes standard operating procedures for key processes such as design, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, servicing,
record keeping, complaint handling and corrective and preventative action. Our quality management system is currently ISO 13485 certified
and is intended to meet the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. We will also be subject to similar requirements
imposed by other countries. 

Manufacturing 

We
currently manufacture the IONIQ ProLung Test and the IONIQ ProLung Test Kit. When volume requirements exceed current manufacturing capacity,
we intend to utilize contract manufacturers for the physical manufacturing of our products. This may afford us numerous benefits, including: 

the
 ability to ramp up production quickly; 

access
 to leading technologies, supply chain networks and best-in-class manufacturing processes for its products; 

flexibility
 to use one or many manufacturers in many regions of the world to optimize costs, production volumes, material availability, lead
 times, and to meet various regional regulations. 

Our
prospective contract manufacturers will source our product components from multiple specialized vendors that supply plastics, sheet metal,
machining, cables, wire harnesses, and other computer hardware components. We maintain our own design control and ISO 13485 quality system. 

19 

Research
and Development 

The
Company spent 1,409,685 and 761,052 on company-sponsored research and development during fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, and
2021, respectively. 

Employees 

As
of April 17, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had nine employees. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Our
business, operations, and financial condition are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results will vary, and may vary materially, from those
anticipated, estimated, projected, or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our business, operations or financial
conditions are the factors identified below: 

RISKS
RELATED TO OUR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT 

We
are an early stage company with limited revenue and no assurance of earning significant revenue over the long term. 

We
were organized in 2004 and since that date have experienced significant losses from operations. We are in the process of commercializing
our proprietary IONIQ ProLung Test in the US and Europe and seeking marketing clearance for the IONIQ ProLung Test in the United States
and expect to incur additional operating losses in the near term. We have generated limited revenue from the sale of our products and
services. The amount of losses we will incur, and whether we will become profitable at all, are highly uncertain. Our net loss for the
year ended December 31, 2022 was 4,359,401 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3,615,029. 

Our
future success depends on our ability to begin generating revenues on a regular and continuing basis and to properly manage costs. Our
ability to generate revenues depends on several factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include our ability to
obtain necessary government and regulatory marketing authorizations, our ability to successfully commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test,
our ability to protect intellectual property related to the IONIQ ProLung Test, our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement for
the test procedure from Medicare and other third- party payers, and our ability to effectively market our products. If we cannot expand
our revenue significantly over the long term, we will not be profitable. 

We
are dependent upon financings to fund our operations and may be unable to continue as a going concern. 

We
do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the cash requirements of our operations and other commitments without raising
funds through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. We do not expect to generate enough cash, if any, from operations to meet our
requirements in the near term. Proceeds raised from funding activities are required for us to have funds to meet our obligations for
the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend, in large part, on our ability to obtain additional financing
and generate positive cash flow from operations, neither of which is certain. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would
be jeopardized and it may not be able to continue operations. 

We
will need significant capital to execute our business plan. 

We
currently generate no revenue, and we require at least 2.0 million in capital each year to operate our business. We also anticipate
requiring additional capital to conduct additional clinical studies prior to submitting an application for FDA clearance for our IONIQ
ProLung Test, If we obtain FDA clearance, of which there is no assurance, we will need to obtain significant additional capital in order
to execute our sales and marketing go-to-market plan. 

We
do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will
be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. We may seek additional capital through a combination of
private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements
that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase
our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Moreover, any debt we incur must be repaid regardless of our operating results.
Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. If such financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, or at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate our testing and developing activities or, if we obtain FDA clearance,
marketing efforts, which will harm our operations and financial condition, if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our
operations, we may have to discontinue operations and liquidate (and we anticipate that our liquidation value would be nominal). 

20 

We
have issued significant indebtedness, and, if we are unable to repay or refinance it, our creditors could force us into bankruptcy. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding Notes and Loans totaling 10,457,022. Nearly the entire balance of our loan obligations are
scheduled to come due at the end of September 2023 as a result of an amendment with our Convertible Note holders undertaken in March
2022. If we default under our loan obligations, and we do not have sufficient cash resources to repay the loan, our creditors would have
the ability to force us into bankruptcy. As a result of any bankruptcy proceeding, if cash resources were depleted, it is doubtful that
there will be any amount available for distribution to our stockholders. 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

We
are in the early stages of commercialization and our IONIQ ProLung Test may never achieve commercial market acceptance. 

Our
IONIQ ProLung Test will not be available for sale until clinical development is completed and regulatory authorizations are obtained.
We submitted a De Novo Application to the US FDA in June of 2022. The FDA has shared concerns regarding, indications for use, risks of
the device, mechanism for action, device usability and repeatability, software testing documentation, cybersecurity, sterility of probe
tip, electrical safety testing, biocompatibility, efficacy, PLW-216 Study design and applicability of the PLW-216 study results to the
US population. We have ongoing meetings with the FDA to address these significant comments from the FDA many of which have not yet been
resolved. 

The
FDA will likely require additional clinical study work to resolve or negotiate the removal of the remaining issues previously identified
by the FDA, as well as address issues to be identified in the future, before clearing the IONIQ ProLung Test for marketing. This may
never occur. Moreover, the successful commercialization of our product will require significant, time-consuming and costly sales and
marketing efforts. If the commercialization of our IONIQ ProLung Test is unsuccessful or we are unable to market our IONIQ ProLung Test
due to market developments, failure to obtain and maintain the regulatory authorizations necessary for our business to be commercially
viable, development of alternative diagnostics or otherwise, we will be required to expend significant additional resources on research
and development to improve our IONIQ ProLung Test. The development of a new test will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in
the creation of any innovative new medical technology. These risks include the possibilities that our test will not be effective or of
acceptable quality, will fail to receive necessary regulatory authorizations, will be uneconomical to manufacture or market or does not
achieve broad market acceptance, and that third parties market a superior or equivalent product. Even if our test is effective, it may
not be accepted by patients or physicians. The failure of our research and development activities to result in any commercially viable
products would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

We
are reliant on a single product and if we are not successful in commercializing the IONIQ ProLung Test and are unable to develop additional
products, our business will not succeed. 

We
have no experience commercializing the IONIQ System and IONIQ ProLung Test. We currently have no products available for sale. If the
IONIQ ProLung Test or our other products in development are not successful at a level sufficient to generate a profit and we are unable
to develop additional products, our business will not succeed. 

The
ability to add to the product suite is subject to the availability of additional funds and certain factors not in our control, such as
government policy. We may eventually want to expand the IONIQ ProLung Test to other cancer targets. ProLung has limited clinical data
suggesting that the IONIQ ProLung Test is effective in other cancers and the IONIQ ProLung Test may not be effective in other cancers. 

21 

The
FDA will likely require additional clinical study work to resolve or negotiate the removal of the remaining issues previously identified
by the FDA, as well as address issues to be identified in the future, before clearing the IONIQ ProLung Test for marketing. This may
never occur. Moreover, the successful commercialization of our product will require significant, time-consuming and costly sales and
marketing efforts. If the commercialization of our IONIQ 

ProLung
Test is unsuccessful or we are unable to market our IONIQ ProLung Test due to market developments, failure to obtain and maintain the
regulatory authorizations necessary for our business to be commercially viable, development of alternative diagnostics or otherwise,
we will be required to expend significant additional resources on research and development to improve our IONIQ ProLung Test. The development
of a new test will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the creation of any innovative new medical technology. These risks
include the possibilities that our test will not be effective or of acceptable quality, will fail to receive necessary regulatory authorizations,
will be uneconomical to manufacture or market or does not achieve broad market acceptance, and that third parties market a superior or
equivalent product. Even if our test is effective, it may not be accepted by patients or physicians. The failure of our research and
development activities to result in any commercially viable products would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
condition. 

We
are subject to litigation risk if our IONIQ ProLung Test is not effective. 

The
nature of the IONIQ ProLung Test as a medical technology platform and the general litigious environment of the market should be regarded
as potential risks that could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. If
the IONIQ ProLung Test does not perform as demonstrated in well controlled clinical trials and as reviewed by the FDA, there could be
significant, even life-threatening, adverse consequences. 

We
may be subject to claims against us as a result of the failure of the IONIQ ProLung Test or other devices. We may also be subject to
claims even though the injury is due to the actions of others, such as manufacturers or medical personnel. If we are sued, we may not
have the resources to defend any such lawsuit or pay any related judgments. In addition, even the existence of a lawsuit will divert
management s attention from the development and commercialization of the IONIQ ProLung Test. Any insurance obtained by us may not
adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us and we are exposed to the risk that claims may be excluded from
insurance coverage and that insurers may become insolvent. Moreover, there may not be any insurance available that would adequately cover
all such risks. 

We
are subject to litigation risk as a result of our prior offering activities. 

In
2018, we experienced a very public proxy battle for control of the board of directors. In that process, both sides of the proxy
battle made numerous allegations of wrongdoing by former officers and directors of ProLung at that time. The allegations have led to expressions
of frustration and anger by existing shareholders, certain of which have threatened to file lawsuits against ProLung, its former
executives and various current and former directors. Complaints by shareholders and former employees have also led to an
investigation being opened by the Utah Division of Securities related to the Company s and individuals activities. If
any of the threats, allegations and investigations lead to legal actions against the Company or its current or former officers and
directors, we will be significantly limited in our ability to raise capital and will be required to expend management time and
financial resources on such legal actions. It is unlikely that we would be able to continue as a going concern following any such
legal actions. 

On
April 23, 2019, the Utah Division of Securities (the Division filed a Notice of Agency Action and an Order
to Show Cause before the Division of Securities of the Department of Commerce of the State of Utah against the Company, Jared Bauer and
former Board Members (Clark Campbell, Tim Treu, Todd Morgan and Robert Raybould). 

In
January 2020, the Division issued a Stipulation and Consent Order which set forth the following: 1) the Company agrees to settle the
matter with the Division by way of the Stipulation and Consent Order; 2) the Stipulation and Consent Order fully resolves all claims
the Division has against the Company pertaining to the Order to Show Cause; 3) the Division, ProLung and Bauer, agree to promptly file
a stipulation and joint motion to dismiss ProLung and Bauer from this administrative action, with respect to Count 1 against ProLung
and Bauer (the only claim brought against Bauer); 4) In or about April 2014, the Company Board of Directors circulated a consent agreement
regarding the issuance of 582,102 (72,763 post-split) ProLung stock certificates to select members of the ProLung Board of Directors
in connection with financing services provided by those members; 5) In or about April 2014, ProLung issued stock grants
of 216,000 (27,000 post-split) shares to Robert W. Raybould, 16,350 (2,044 post-split) shares to Steve Eror, 63,750 (7,968 post-split)
shares to Treu; 193,500 (24,118 post-split) shares to Campbell; and 97,500 (12,188 post-split) shares to Morgan; 6) Subsequent to issuance
of those shares, ProLung was informed by counsel of potential consequences for Pro Lung employing unlicensed agents and individuals receiving
the shares as compensation directly for sale of securities without a securities license, as opposed to receiving shares as compensation
for generalized board service. Subsequently, no further shares were issued as compensation for fundraising. Mr. Eror returned his shares
to the Company. However, Raybould, Treu, Campbell and Morgan did not return their shares to the Company. ProLung did not disclose the
potential licensing violation until on or about December 3, 2018, in its Note Purchase Agreements. 

As
set forth by the Company in its Form 8-K dated November 27, 2019, Campbell, Treu, Morgan, and Raybould entered into Stipulation and Consent
Orders wherein they returned shares of stock to the Company s treasury and paid fines to the Division of Securities. 

22 

On
January 9, 2020, the Division entered an order as follows: 1) entering certain Findings and Conclusions by the Division, which ProLung
admitted via a Stipulation and Consent Order; 2) ordering ProLung to cease and desist from violating Utah Uniform Securities Act (the
 Act and to comply with the requirements of the Act in all future business in the state of Utah; 3)
ordering ProLung to disclose the contents of the order to investors and prospective investors in all future capital raising efforts and
disclosure documents of ProLung; and 4) Ordering ProLung to pay a fine of 55,000 to the Division. 

We
may incur substantial product liability expenses due to manufacturing or design defects, or the use or misuse of our products. 

Our
business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical products. We
may face liability to our distributors and customers if our products are not manufactured as per specifications or if such specifications
cause the products to become unsafe or fail to function as marketed or sold. We may also face substantial liability for damages if our
products produce adverse side effects or defects are identified with any of our products that harm patients and other users. Any such
failures or defects may lead to a breakdown in our relationships with distributors and purchasers leading to a substantial decline in
or collapse of our market. In addition, if any judgments or liabilities are material in size, we may be unable to satisfy such liabilities.
Any product liability could harm our operations and a large judgment could force us to discontinue our operations. 

We
are subject to the risk of product recalls if our products are defective. 

The
FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of
material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. In the case of the FDA, the authority to
require a recall must be based on an FDA finding where there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse
health consequences or death. A government- mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result
of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects, or other issues. Recalls, which include corrections as well
as removals, of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues. 

Lack
of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for our customers could delay or limit the adoption of our products. 

We
may experience limited or no sales growth resulting from limitations on coverage and reimbursement for the diagnostic procedures performed
with our products by third-party payors, and we cannot assure you that our sales will not be impeded and our business harmed if third-party
payors fail to provide reimbursement for such procedures that customers view as adequate. We are pursuing CPT and HCPCS codes since no
existing codes appear to cover the purchase and use of our device. 

Moreover,
many private payors look to Medicare in setting their reimbursement policies and amounts. If Medicare does not offer adequate reimbursement
for the services offered using our products, this may affect reimbursement determinations by certain private payors. 

The
absence of, or limits on, reimbursements may affect our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability. 

The
cost of a significant portion of healthcare is funded by governmental, and other third-party, insurance programs. It is possible that
our products will not be covered or adequately reimbursed by governments or insurance providers, which will seriously harm our ability
to generate revenue. In addition, even if payers cover our products (or the services in which our products are used), limits on reimbursement
imposed by such programs may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and others to purchase our products. In addition, limitations
on reimbursement for procedures which utilize our products could adversely affect our business. 

23 

If
the IONIQ ProLung Test is not accepted by physicians and patients, we will be unable to achieve market acceptance. 

Patients
may be unwilling to depart from the current standard of care and opt not to undergo the IONIQ ProLung Test. In addition, physicians tend
to be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products. Physicians
may not recommend or order the IONIQ ProLung Test until there is long-term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing
patient management methods, there are recommendations from prominent physicians that the IONIQ ProLung Test is safe, effective, and clinically
useful, and that reimbursement or insurance coverage is available. We cannot predict when, if ever, physicians and patients may adopt
the use of the IONIQ ProLung Test. If the IONIQ ProLung Test does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians
and healthcare payors, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. 

Accordingly,
you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by early commercial
stage companies. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history
will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that we cannot assure you that we will be able to: 

successfully
 execute our current business plan for the commercialization of the IONIQ ProLung Test, or that our business plan is sound; 

successfully
 contract for and establish a commercial supply of components for the manufacture of the IONIQ ProLung Test and the ProLung Scan System; 

achieve
 market acceptance of the IONIQ ProLung Test; and 

attract
 and retain experienced personnel. 

If
we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment will be adversely affected. 

We
are a small company and may be unable to compete with larger or better-funded companies that promote competitive technologies. 

There
are a number of competitive technologies currently being developed as well as refinements being made to existing competitive technologies.
Technologies being developed or obtaining limited commercialization for the same intended use as our test include, methylated DNA tests,
micro RNA tests, panels of proteins and minimally invasive 

biopsy.
These include the current standard of care for the indication to be claimed for the IONIQ ProLung Test; the use of serial chest CT views
over a period often ranging from three months to three and one-half years. To the extent that any of these technologies or refinements
result in products that successfully address some of the shortcomings of existing products, or result in quality products that are less
expensive, safer or outperform existing tests and the IONIQ ProLung Test, future demand for the IONIQ ProLung Test may be reduced or
eliminated. 

The
future market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology. Our future financial performance will, in part, be dependent
on our ability to develop and manufacture new products or improvements to existing products on a cost-effective basis, to introduce them
to the market on a timely basis, and to have them accepted by physicians. We may not be able to keep pace with technological change or
to develop viable new products in a timely fashion. Factors that could delay the release of potential products or even cancellation of
our plans to produce and market these new products could include delays in research and development, delays in securing future regulatory
authorizations, or changes in the competitive landscape. 

Many
competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we propose to compete, which may make such competitors and their
products more attractive to surgeons, hospitals, group purchasing organizations, and other potential customers. Many competitors also
have significantly more financial resources than us. Competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by competitors
could have an adverse effect on our ability to establish market acceptance for the IONIQ ProLung Test. We cannot predict future markets
for the IONIQ ProLung Test or other products, and we may not be able to shift production to other products in the event of a lack of
market demand for the IONIQ ProLung Test, leading to an accompanying adverse effect on our profitability. 

24 

We
are dependent upon contract manufacturers to safely and timely manufacture our products. 

If
we commercialize our IONIQ ProLung Test, we will need to establish arrangements with contract manufacturers to manufacture, package,
label, and deliver our products. Our business will suffer if there are delays or difficulties in establishing relationships with manufacturers
to manufacture, package, label, and deliver our products, or if the prices charged by such manufacturers are higher than anticipated.
Moreover, contract manufacturers that we may use must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices, as required by FDA. If any such
manufacturers fail to comply with FDA requirements, they may be unable to manufacture our products. In addition, such manufacturers may
fail to manufacture our products in accordance with specifications or may fail to meet delivery timelines, which may cause problems in
our customer or distributor relationships and potentially lead to defaults or an obligation to pay damages. If we are unable to obtain
or retain third party manufacturing on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned. Our
dependence upon third parties for the manufacturing of our products may harm our ability to generate significant revenues or acceptable
profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such compliant products on a timely and competitive basis. 

Any
manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally,
we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our product. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several
risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability
and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of the
IONIQ ProLung Test, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales. 

We
are dependent upon third parties for marketing and other aspects of our business. 

We
have limited experience in sales, marketing and distribution of our products and are just beginning the process of developing a sales
and marketing organization, which includes an establishment of a distributor network. Our lack of experience could negatively impact
our ability to enter into or maintain collaborative arrangements or other third-party relationships which are important to the successful
commercialization of our products and potential profitability. We may be unable to establish or maintain adequate sales and distribution
capabilities. 

In
developing a preliminary commercialization plan, much of our strategy for the commercialization of the IONIQ ProLung Test will also rely
on us entering into various arrangements with licensors, distributors, and other third parties. We may be unable to enter into necessary
distribution and licensing agreements to market the product. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited
or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of third parties. 

Failure
to enter into or maintain these arrangements with third parties or failure to develop our own sales and marketing infrastructure could
substantially impair or even eliminate our ability to market the IONIQ ProLung Test. Our reliance on collaboration with others may adversely
affect our ability to continue to operate, pursue our technology development program, or to achieve profitability. 

25 

Any
clinical trials that we conduct may not be completed on schedule, or at all, or may be more expensive than we expect, which could prevent
or delay regulatory authorization(s) of our products or impair our financial position. 

The
commencement or completion of any clinical trials that we conduct may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited
to, the following: 

the
 FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or place on hold a clinical trial, or do not give us the authorization required to start
 a clinical trial; 

the
 data and safety monitoring committee or applicable hospital institutional ethics review board recommends that a trial be placed on
 hold or suspended; 

fewer
 patients meet our clinical study criteria and our enrollment rate is lower than we expected; 

patients
 do not return for follow-up as expected; 

clinical
 trial sites decide not to participate or cease participation in a clinical trial; 

patients
 experience adverse side effects or events related to our IONIQ ProLung Test or for unrelated reasons; 

third-party
 clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical
 practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; 

We,
 our licensees, or other persons engaged on our behalf, fail regulatory inspections of our manufacturing facilities requiring us to
 undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 

contractual
 or other disputes with any parties carrying out trials on our behalf; 

pre-clinical
 or clinical data are interpreted by third parties in unanticipated ways; or 

our
 trial design is considered inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy of the product. 

Not
 receiving 3 rd party products required to operate our device due to supply chain 

Patient enrollment in clinical
trials and completion of patient follow-up in clinical trials depend on many factors, including the size of the target patient population,
the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and patient compliance. Delays in patient enrollment or
failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may cause an increase in costs and delays or result in the failure of the trial. 

In developing a preliminary commercialization plan,
much of our strategy for the commercialization of the IONIQ ProLung Test will also rely on us entering into various arrangements with
licensors, distributors, and other third parties. We may be unable to enter into necessary distribution and licensing agreements to market
the product. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution
activities of third parties. Failure to enter into or maintain these arrangements with third parties or failure to develop our own sales
and marketing infrastructure could substantially impair or even eliminate our ability to market the IONIQ ProLung Test. Our reliance on
collaboration with others may adversely affect our ability to continue to operate, pursue our technology development program, or to achieve
profitability. 

Any clinical trials that we conduct may not
be completed on schedule, or at all, or may be more expensive than we expect, which could prevent or delay regulatory authorization(s)
of our products or impair our financial position. 

The commencement or completion of any clinical trials
that we conduct may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 

the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspend or place on hold a clinical trial, or do not give us the authorization required to start a clinical trial; 

the data and safety monitoring committee or applicable hospital institutional ethics review board recommends that a trial be placed on hold or suspended; 

fewer patients meet our clinical study criteria and our enrollment rate is lower than we expected; 

patients experience adverse side effects or events related to our IONIQ ProLung Test or for unrelated reasons; 

third-party clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner; 

We, our licensees, or other persons engaged on our behalf, fail regulatory inspections of our manufacturing facilities requiring us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 

contractual or other disputes with any parties carrying out trials on our behalf; 

pre-clinical or clinical data are interpreted by third parties in unanticipated ways; or 

our trial design is considered inadequate to demonstrate safety and/or efficacy of the product. 

Not receiving 3rd party products required to operate our device due to supply chain 

26 

Patient
enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient follow-up in clinical trials depend on many factors, including the size of the
target patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and patient compliance. Delays
in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a study may cause an increase in costs and delays or result
in the failure of the trial. 

Our
clinical trial costs will increase if we have material delays in those trials or if we need to perform more or larger trials than planned.
Adverse events during a clinical trial could cause us to repeat a trial, terminate a trial or cancel an entire program. Should our clinical
development plan be delayed, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 

We
engage in related party transactions, which result in a conflict of interest involving our management. 

We
have engaged in the past, and may continue to engage, in related party transactions. Related party transactions present difficult conflicts
of interest could result in disadvantages to our company and may impair investor confidence, which could materially and adversely affect
us. Related party transactions could also cause us to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of our business,
and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interests
of our company and our stockholders. 

IONIQ
ProLung Tests may produce false positive and false negative results. 

A
patient may have a low composite risk score as measured by the IONIQ ProLung Test and still have lung cancer. A low composite risk score
does not preclude risk for lung cancer. This patient, however, based upon a false negative IONIQ ProLung Test, may be subject to less
stringent clinical vigilance. The IONIQ ProLung Test is to be used in conjunction with all available clinical risk factors and findings
including physician/health practitioner judgment. Nonetheless, a false negative result generated from the IONIQ ProLung Test may contribute
to a patient not receiving a timely diagnosis of or treatment for existing lung cancer. 

By
contrast, a patient may have a high composite risk score but not have lung cancer. Such a patient may be subject to greater clinical
vigilance or unnecessary invasive procedures, such as biopsy, thus subjecting the patient to greater morbidity and potential mortality
due to a falsely positive IONIQ ProLung Test. Again, since the IONIQ ProLung Test is to be used in conjunction with other clinical findings,
and not as a stand-alone diagnostic test, such a case would be unlikely. Nonetheless, a false positive result generated from the IONIQ
ProLung Test may contribute to a patient receiving unnecessary procedures, such as CT scans and lung biopsies. False positive and false
negative results would likely erode market acceptance of the IONIQ ProLung Test and would thus harm our business, cash flows and operations. 

Our
clinical studies may produce unfavorable results. 

Unfavorable
results could prevent the IONIQ ProLung Test from obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations. Unfavorable clinical results may
also prevent the Company from adequately commercializing the IONIQ ProLung Test in foreign markets such as the European Union which would
harm our business, cash flows and operations. The Company may not have a cost-effective resolution to overcome either of these obstacles. 

Our
success depends upon our ability to effectively market our products. 

If
the IONIQ ProLung Test does not achieve market acceptance, we will be unable to generate significant revenues. The commercial success
of the IONIQ ProLung Test will depend primarily on convincing healthcare providers to adopt and use the IONIQ ProLung Test. To accomplish
this, we, together with any other marketing or distribution collaborators, will need to convince members of the medical community the
benefits of the IONIQ ProLung Test through, for example, published papers, presentations at scientific conferences, and additional clinical
data. Medical providers will not use our product unless we can demonstrate that our product consistently produces results comparable
or superior to existing products and has acceptable safety profiles and costs. If we are not successful in these efforts, market acceptance
of the IONIQ ProLung Test could be limited. Even if we demonstrate the effectiveness of the IONIQ ProLung Test, medical practitioners
may still use other products. If the IONIQ ProLung Test does not achieve broad market acceptance, we will be unable to generate significant
revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flows, and results of operations. 

27 

We
are dependent on key personnel, who may terminate their employment at any time. 

Our
success depends, in large part, upon the talents and skills of company management and other key personnel. There can be no assurance
that we would be able to find suitable replacements for all such personnel or that suitable personnel could be obtained for an amount
that we could afford. In the future, a need for additional qualified personnel is expected in order to operate the business successfully.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract employees of adequate qualification or that we would be able to afford such
personnel. 

Competition
for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly
qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with
us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business,
operating results or financial condition. 

Other
medical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and
a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement.
Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue
to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize our product would be limited. 

The
continuing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak or other pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. 

The
novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID 19) identified in China in late 2019 has globally spread throughout other areas such as Asia,
Europe, the Middle East, and North America and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus,
such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify
our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events
and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests
of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks
posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. 

The
degree to which COVID-19 or other global pandemics impacts our operations and financial results will depend on future developments, which
are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the
actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 

Risks
Related to Our Regulatory and Legal Environment 

We
must obtain regulatory clearance or approval in the US and other markets to be able to commence marketing and sales in those markets. 

In
many countries, we are required to obtain government clearance or approval before we can market and sell a medical device like the IONIQ
ProLung Test. 

Obtaining
the necessary clearance or approval is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process, which differs from country-to-country. Failure
to comply with the premarket authorization requirements of a country can result in serious penalties, including fines, recalls, seizure
of product, suspension of sales, refusal to grant other approvals or clearances, increased requirements for quality control or (in severe
cases) criminal prosecution. The imposition of any of the afore-mentioned penalties would adversely affect our business. 

We
are seeking clearance to sell the IONIQ ProLung Test in the US and plan to seek clearance in other markets. Each market has unique regulatory
requirements. In the US, FDA marketing clearance will be required before the IONIQ 

28 

ProLung
Test may be marketed in the US. We expect to be subject to the premarket notification or de novo clearance pathway, but may be
subject to premarket approval, which would substantially lengthen (and substantially increase the costs associated with) the regulatory
process beyond that which is currently anticipated. As with the FDA review process, there are numerous risks associated with the review
of medical devices by foreign regulatory agencies. The foreign regulatory agencies may request additional data to demonstrate the clinical
safety and efficacy of a product. It is possible that we may not obtain the clearance or approval required to market the IONIQ ProLung
Test in the US or another significant potential market, which would harm our long-term revenue potential. 

Even
if marketing clearance (or approval) is granted, such clearance (or approval) may include significant limitations on the indicated use(s)
for which the product may legally be marketed i.e., the clearance may not allow us to make the type of claims that we believe
we need to make for the IONIQ ProLung Test to be commercially viable. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearance(s) or approval(s) would
also harm our financial condition. A failure to obtain required clearances for our desired indication(s) in a timely fashion, particularly
in the US, would significantly harm our long-term ability to continue as a going concern. 

Even
if we receive regulatory clearance or approval for the IONIQ ProLung Test, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize it
and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited. 

The
commercial success of the IONIQ ProLung Test will depend on its acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and
health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of the IONIQ ProLung Test will depend on a number of factors, including: 

demonstration
 of clinical safety, efficacy, and utility; 

relative
 convenience and ease of use; 

the
 prevalence and severity of any adverse effects; 

the
 willingness of physicians to order the IONIQ ProLung Test and of the target patient population to try new medical devices; 

the
 introduction of any new products that in the future may become available to compete with the IONIQ ProLung Test; 

pricing
 and cost-effectiveness; 

the
 inclusion or omission of the IONIQ ProLung Test in applicable treatment guidelines; 

the
 effectiveness of our or any future collaborators sales and marketing strategies; 

limitations
 or warnings contained in FDA-cleared (or approved) labeling; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement from government health care programs, including
 Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors; and 

the
 willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement. 

In
addition, even if we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, the timing or scope of any clearances or approvals may prohibit or reduce
our ability to commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market
opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory clearance
(or approval) we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-market commitments that render the IONIQ ProLung
Test not commercially viable. For example, third-party payers may deny coverage for the test or set reimbursement for the IONIQ ProLung
Test procedure at a rate that is insufficient to cover provider costs, or regulatory authorities may grant clearance or approval contingent
on ProLung s performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. Moreover, product clearances and approvals may be withdrawn
for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing
scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of the IONIQ ProLung Test. 

29 

If
we obtain FDA clearance, we will be subject to Medical Device Reporting MDR requirements, which may lead to inquiries,
injunctions, or liabilities. 

Under
the FDA MDR regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the FDA when they receive a report or become
aware that a device has caused or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would
likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices on
the market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they
produce or sell to the regulatory agency, or other Competent Authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. Were we to learn
of a reportable adverse event, we would submit the required information to the relevant regulatory agency, to which the agency may respond
with additional request(s) for information if the agency has any questions. 

Malfunction
of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls, including corrections, or customer notifications,
or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately
or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease distribution of the affected products, initiate voluntary recalls,
and redesign the products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing
the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital,
distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. 

Existing
US regulatory laws and cost-saving initiatives may harm our revenues and create additional expenses. 

To
the extent that we market the IONIQ ProLung Test in the US, federal healthcare reform may adversely affect the results of our domestic
operations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in March 2010. The Affordable Care
Act included several provisions intended to reduce the volume of medical procedures, which, in turn, could result in reduced demand for
our products and increased downward pricing pressure. While the Affordable Care Act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to
uninsured persons in the US, the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on potential sales of the IONIQ ProLung Test
is uncertain at this time. Further, we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the Affordable Care Act may have on our business. 

Recently
proposed healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products. 

The
pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging as a result of any of one several possible
regulatory developments, including policies advanced by the United States government, new healthcare legislation, repeal or reform of
the Affordable Care Act, or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. The US government has shown significant
interest in pursuing healthcare reform and reducing healthcare costs. For example, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments
to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year were implemented starting in 2013. Any government-adopted reform measures that further decrease
the amount of reimbursement our customers receive from governmental and other third-party payers could potentially adversely affect our
business. 

We
will be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse law regulations. 

Our
operations may be directly or indirectly affected by various broad federal, state or foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In particular,
the US federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration
(including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for referring an
individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part
under a Federal health care program, or in return for the ordering, leasing, purchasing, or arranging for or recommending the ordering,
purchasing or leasing of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare
programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

We
are also subject to the fraud and abuse provisions of the US federal HIPAA statute, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit
executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense,
or making false statements or concealing a material fact relating to payment for health-care benefits, items or services, and federal
 sunshine laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with healthcare providers, such as the reporting
and disclosure requirements imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain medical device manufacturers regarding any transfer
of value made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. 

30 

In
addition, the US federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing
use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam 
actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as whistleblowers, 
may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the
False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for
each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

Many
states and other countries have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws
which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict
our marketing activities with physicians, and require us to report consulting and other payments to physicians. Some states and other
countries mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign
fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. 

If
our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us
now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental
healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate
our business and our financial results. 

Our
clinical study designs have not been reviewed by the FDA. 

Our
PL-208 and PLW-216 clinical studies were designed without input from the FDA. We have received significant comments from the FDA. There
can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the design of PL-208 and PLW-216 or any future study, or agree that the results generated
in our PL-208 and PLW-216 trial is sufficient for FDA to approve or clear the IONIQ ProLung Test for our desired indication for use.
Even if our clinical studies produce favorable results, the FDA may refuse regulatory clearance and or require additional research causing
delays in the launch and commercialization of the IONIQ ProLung Test in the US. 

Our
clinical studies have resulted in statistically significant variability and the results may be insufficient to gain marketing clearance
from the FDA. 

Our
clinical studies may produce unfavorable results which could prevent or delay ProLung from obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.
In November 2018, we reported our PL-209 study results indicating day-to-day variability is repeatable; however, same-day variability
is statistically significant with a 2 difference in scores though the clinical impact is unclear. In January 2019, we announced preliminary
results for our PL-208 study. In the Validation Set (n=174 subjects), the IONIQ ProLung Test demonstrated a sensitivity of 68 , specificity
of 49 , Positive 

Predictive
Value (PPV) of 70 , Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 47 and an Accuracy of 61 . In, the fall of 2019 we announced the results of PLW-216.
In the study of 486 subjects with 418 qualified subjects, the IONIQ ProLung Test returned results of 84 sensitivity, 73 specificity, 78 Positive
Predictive Value (PPV) and 80 Negative Predictive Value (NPV). The performance from PL-208, PL-209 and PLW-216 may be insufficient to
gain marketing clearance from the FDA. 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

We
may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to the potential value of our products and company. 

We
have obtained patent protection for aspects of the IONIQ ProLung Test in a limited number of jurisdictions, and there is no guarantee
that such protection will be available for the IONIQ ProLung Test in all jurisdictions, or, that once obtained, we would be able to enforce
such rights. 

31 

Disputes
may arise between us and others as to the scope, validity and ownership rights of patents. Any defense of patents could prove to be costly
and time consuming and we may not be in a position, or may deem it unadvisable, to carry on such a defense. 

There
can be no assurance that any patent applications that we or our licensors file will result in patents being issued or that, if issued,
the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. There can also be no assurance that any patents issued
to us or that we license will not be infringed on or circumvented by others, or that others will not obtain patents that we would need
to license or circumvent. Our patents may not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies
or developing competing products. Competitors may be able to use technologies in competing products that perform substantially the same
as our technologies but avoid infringing on our patent claims. Under these circumstances, our patents would be of little commercial value. 

Additionally,
there can be no assurance that patents, even after issuance, will be upheld by applicable courts. There can be no assurance that licenses,
which might be required for our processes or products, would be available on reasonable terms, or that patents issued to others would
not prevent us from developing and marketing its products. To the extent that we also rely on un-patented trade secrets, there can be
no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise
gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology. Disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. Further, to the extent
that our employees, consultants or contractors use trade secret technology or know-how owned by others in their work for us, disputes
may arise as to the ownership of related inventions. 

We
may incur significant costs and liability if we infringe, or are accused of infringing on, the intellectual property rights of others. 

We
may incur significant liability if we infringe the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, including damages, inability
to sell or license the IONIQ ProLung Test without obtaining a license from the patent holder, which may not be available at commercially
reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to redesign the IONIQ ProLung 

Test
so that it does not infringe on the third-party patent, which redesign may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time.
Although no third party has asserted a claim of infringement against us, in the event that our technologies infringe or violate the patent
or other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization
of any product that uses these technologies. There may be patents held by others of which we are unaware that contain claims that our
product or operations infringe. In addition, given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there may be patents of which we
may ultimately be held to infringe, particularly if the claims of the patent are determined to be broader than we believe them to be.
Even if we are ultimately successful in our defense of an infringement case, the costs of litigation would significantly harm our business. 

We
may need to market the IONIQ ProLung Test under a different name in the EU to avoid the risk of infringement. 

We
are aware of a company that markets an assay to be used as a liquid biopsy test for lung cancer detection under the name Epi ProLung,
which is trademarked in the EU. If we market the IONIQ ProLung Test in the EU, we may be subject to the risk of infringement. If we determine,
at the time we choose to market the IONIQ ProLung Test in the EU, that we may infringe on this trademark, we might need to change the
name under which we market the IONIQ ProLung Test in the EU. 

Parts,
components, and software incorporated in the IONIQ System may become obsolete. 

The
IONIQ System consists of both custom and off the shelf parts and software. As off-the-shelf components age, they may become obsolete
requiring the Company to procure, test and validate replacement components, parts and software for the IONIQ System. 

32 

We
rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business, and a material disruption
of critical information systems or a material breach in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships. 

We
rely on information technology systems (including technology from third-party providers) to process, transmit, and store electronic information
in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information. Our internal information
technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious
code, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential
or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no
assurance that our protective measures have prevented or will prevent security breaches, any of which could have a significant impact
on our business, reputation and financial condition, particularly attacks that result in our intellectual property and other confidential
information being accessed or stolen. We rely on third-party vendors to supply and support certain aspects of our information technology
systems. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference or other
significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or
compromise the information security of our own systems. Cyber-attacks could also result in unauthorized access to our systems and products,
including personal information of individuals, which could trigger notification requirements, encourage actions by regulatory bodies,
result in adverse publicity, prompt us to offer credit support products or services to affected individuals and lead to class action
or other civil litigation. We currently do not maintain cybersecurity insurance. If we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information
technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems,
we could, lose customers, be subject to fraud, breach our agreements with or duties toward customers, physicians, other health care professionals
and employees, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses or lose revenues, sustain damage to our reputation or
suffer other adverse consequences. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with
product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, and product recalls or field actions. Any of these
events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. 

Our
business is subject to complex and evolving U.S., state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection.
Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business
practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business. 

The
U.S. and many other countries in which we conduct our operations have adopted laws and regulations protecting certain data, including
medical and personal data, and requiring data holders and controllers to implement administrative, logical and technical controls and
procedures in order to protect the privacy of such data. Individual states have also begun to enact data privacy laws. For example, California s
Consumer Protection Act went into effect on January 1, 2020, giving consumers the right to demand certain information and actions from
companies who collect personal information. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws and regulations that require individually
identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. In addition,
regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of additional proposals concerning data protection. These laws and regulations
have been, and may continue to be, inconsistent with each other, requiring different approaches in different jurisdictions. In addition,
the interpretation and application of medical and personal data protection laws and regulations in the U.S., Europe, China and elsewhere
are often uncertain and in flux. Further, we may incur significant expense in connection with our efforts to comply with those laws and
regulations. It is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our
data practices, possibly resulting in fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect
on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us
to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty
regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S. and other non-EU jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR, which came
into application in the EU on May 25, 2018, applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products
and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business
practices, and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4 of global annual turnover
for the preceding financial year or 20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements).

Risks
Related to Capital Stock 

Our
SEC Reports contain projections and forward-looking statements that may not prove to be accurate. 

Our
SEC Reports, including those delivered herewith, contain projections that are based on our assumptions and judgments as of the date of
such reports concerning future events and are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control.
Our actual results may materially differ from the results we have projected. In addition, our SEC Reports contain forward-looking statements
that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. All statements other than those of historical facts, including those regarding
business strategy, plans and objectives of management, projected costs, and expected benefits are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are based on information and expectations as of the date of the respective SEC Report. Important factors that could cause
our results to differ materially from expectations include those set forth in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in
our SEC Reports. We disclaim any obligation or intent to update these forward- looking statements. 

There
is no trading market for our common stock, and it is possible that no trading market will develop. 

There
is currently no public trading market for the Company s common stock, and there is no assurance that a public market for the Company s
common stock will exist in the future. We do not currently meet the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other exchange.
We do meet the requirements for listing on an over- the-counter market; however, an application for quotation in the over-the-counter
market must be submitted by one or more market makers who: 1) are approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, 2) who agree
to sponsor the security, and 3) who demonstrate compliance with SEC Rule 15 2-11 before initiating a quote in a security on the
over-the-counter market. 

If
our common stock commences trading in the over-the-counter market, it will likely be subject to penny stock rules, which may restrict
liquidity. 

If
our common stock becomes tradable in the secondary market, it may be subject to the penny stock rules adopted by the SEC that require
brokers to provide extensive disclosure to their customers prior to executing trades in penny stocks. These disclosure requirements may
cause a reduction in the trading activity of the Company s common stock, which in all likelihood would make it difficult for our
shareholders to sell their securities. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities
registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market). Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer,
prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that
provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with
current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The broker-dealer must
also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s
written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the
secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by
such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market
price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company s common
stock and may affect the Purchaser s ability to resell the common stock. 

34 

Provisions
in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to
entrenchment of management. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could significantly reduce
the value of our shares to a potential acquirer or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without the consent
of our Board of Directors. The provisions in our charter documents include the following: 

a
 classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership
 of a majority of our Board of Directors; 

no
 cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 

the
 exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors
 or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of
 Directors; 

the
 prohibition on removal of directors without cause; 

the
 ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms
 of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute
 the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 

the
 ability of our Board of Directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; 

the
 requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the President of the Company or by the Board of Directors,
 which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of
 directors. 

In
addition, these provisions would apply even if we were to receive an offer that some stockholders may consider beneficial. 

We
are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Section 203,
a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder
has held the stock for three years or, among other exceptions, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. 

We
are subject to various regulatory regimes, and may be adversely affected by inquiries, investigations and allegations that we have not
complied with governing rules and laws. 

In
light of our status as a reporting company and the early stage of our business, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulatory regimes
in addition to those applicable to all businesses generally. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements applicable to
U.S. reporting issuers, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and certain state and provincial securities laws. In addition, because
we are in an early stage of development and intend on issuing securities to raise capital and use acquisitions for growth, our actions
will be governed by state and federal securities laws and laws governing the issuance of securities, which are complex. In connection
with such laws, we may be subject to periodic audits, inquiries, and investigations. Any such audits, inquiries, and investigations may
divert considerable financial and human resources and adversely affect the execution of our business plan. 

Through
such audits, inquiries, and investigations, we, or a regulator, may determine that we are out of compliance with one or more governing
rules or laws. Remedying such non-compliance diverts additional financial and human resources. In addition, in the future, we may be
subject to a formal charge or determination that we have materially violated a governing law, rule, or regulation. We may also be subject
to lawsuits as a result of alleged violation of the securities laws or governing corporate laws. Any charge or allegation, and particularly
any determination, that we had materially violated a governing law would harm our ability to enter into business relationships, recruit
qualified officers and employees, and raise capital. 

35 

If
a market develops for our common stock, we expect the market price to be volatile. 

The
market prices of securities of smaller companies tend to be highly volatile. If a market develops for our common stock, of which there
can be no assurance, our stock price may change dramatically as the result of announcements of our quarterly results, slow revenue growth,
absence of profits, the rate of our expansion, significant litigation or other factors or events that would be expected to affect our
business or financial condition, results of operations, and other factors specific to our business and future prospects. In addition,
the market price for our common stock may be affected by various factors not directly related to our business, including the following: 

intentional
 manipulation of our stock price by existing or future stockholders; 

short
 selling of our common stock or related derivative securities; 

a
 single acquisition or disposition, or several related acquisitions or dispositions, of a large number of our shares of common stock; 

the
 interest, or lack of interest, of the market in our business sector; 

economic
 and other external market factors, such as a general decline in market prices due to poor economic indicators or investor distrust. 

We
have never paid, and do not intend to pay in the future, dividends on our common stock. 

We
have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect
to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. It is unlikely that investors will derive any current income from ownership of our stock.
This means that the potential for economic gain from ownership of our stock depends on appreciation of our stock price and will only
be realized by a sale of the stock at a price higher than the purchase price.

Overview 

We
are a medical technology company with a mission to dramatically improve the cancer landscape with a modern solution for the early
detection of multiple cancers thereby expanding the therapeutic window, significantly improving survivability, and reducing the cost
of healthcare. One in two Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in five will die. Clinical
literature shows that early detection can save lives and money. We operate at the confluence of our Electrical Impedance Analytics
(EIA) technology or bioimpedance and artificial intelligence (AI). We are developing an advanced multi-cancer screening technology
for early detection of multipole cancers that may expand the therapeutic window, dramatically improve survivability and reduce the
cost of healthcare. We have active projects in lung, breast and gastro-intestinal (GI) cancers. The first planned product utilizing
our proprietary analytic platform, the IONIQ ProLung Test for lung cancer, has been designated a Breakthrough Device by the
U.S. FDA in February 2020 We submitted our de novo application to the U.S. FDA in February 2022 and we received a substantive
review from the FDA outlining additional information that is required for US regulatory clearance These items include questions and
requests related to biocompatibility testing, clinical data, Indications for Use and labeling, cybersecurity documentation,
electrical safety, special controls, human factors and usability, performance testing, risk analysis, software, sterility and shelf
life. We remain fully committed to gaining U.S. FDA regulatory de novo clearance and subsequently commercializing the IONIQ
ProLung Test for lung cancer. 

We
believe the IONIQ ProLung Test for lung cancer, in conjunction with the discovery of a nodule by CT scan, provides a more rapid assessment
of the risk of malignancy, which must be determined prior to biopsy. Since a lung biopsy is invasive and may require life threatening
thoracic surgery, physicians, patients, and insurance companies typically delay biopsy and therapy until the risk of malignancy outweighs
the risk of further diagnostic procedures. For these patients, the delay reduces the treatment opportunity window and may cause sustained
emotional trauma. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion is included to describe our consolidated financial position and results of operations. The consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion.

Fiscal
Year Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenue
and Cost of Revenue. 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021, we had no revenue. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expense . Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,409,685 compared to research
and development expense of 761,052 for the year ended December 31, 2021; representing an increase of 648,633. The increase was due
to focused attention in support of our FDA submission. We would expect our research and development costs to remain relatively constant
during 2023. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,986,563
compared to selling, general, and administrative expense of 1,722,044 for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase
of 264,519. This increase was due to increases in fundraising activities, consulting in support of our FDA submission, stock compensation,
and insurance rates in 2022. 

Other
Expense. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 963,153 compared to 1,131,933 the year ended December 31, 2021.
The in costs consists of the following: 

Interest
Expense Interest decreased in 2022 to 963,153 from 1,268,823 in 2021 due to all loan costs becoming fully amortized during
2021. 

Gain/
Loss on Debt Extinguishment During 2021, the Company was able to settle various obligations at amounts less than originally
accrued thus causing a gain on debt extinguishment, we did not have such items during 2022. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
following is a summary of our key liquidity measures at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 (11,690,008 

We
need additional capital to continue our operations. We received 1,825,582 in cash from the exercise of warrants during the year ended
December 31, 2022. In order for us to continue operations we will need additional capital which will require us to issue equity securities,
debt securities and rights to acquire equity securities. We have no existing commitment to provide capital, and given our early stage
of development, we may be unable to raise sufficient capital when needed and, in any case, will likely be required to pay a high price
for capital. 

Our
future capital requirements and adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including: 

Our
 ability to find a commercial market for our IONIQ ProLung Test and obtain needed regulatory clearance 

Our
 financial results; 

the
 cost and availability of capital generally; and 

the
 occurrence of unexpected adverse expenses or events.

In
March 2018, we began issuing 8 convertible promissory notes convertible notes ). The convertible notes are unsecured.
Principal and accrued interest were originally set to mature in March 31, 2022; however, these notes, along with our other notes were
amended in March 2022 to extend maturity until September 30, 2023. The holder of the convertible note is entitled, at its option, to
convert all, or any portion of the outstanding principal and interest, into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from
 3.20 to 10.53 per share. Interest accruing from the date of issuance to the conversion date shall be paid on the maturity date. Through
December 31, 2022, we have issued 10,457,022 in convertible promissory notes.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, future events may cause us to change our assumptions and estimates, which may require
adjustment. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We have determined that for the periods reported in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. 

40 

Long-lived
Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, and intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset or asset group. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment
is calculated based on fair value. 

Stock-based
Compensation The Company measures the cost of employee and consulting services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The awards issued are valued using a fair value-based measurement method.
The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee or consultant is required to provide services in exchange for
the award, usually the vesting period.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we necessarily
are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. 

41 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective, because certain deficiencies involving internal controls constituted material weaknesses as discussed below. The
material weaknesses identified did not result in the restatement of any previously reported financial statements or any other related
financial disclosure, nor does management believe that it had any effect on the accuracy of our financial statements for the current
reporting period. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. 

Because
of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Additionally,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded
that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore the internal controls are considered
not effective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2022, the following material weaknesses existed: 

The
Company did not maintain effective entity-level internal controls as defined by the framework issued by COSO. Specifically, the Company
did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. Due to this material
weakness, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2022. 

In
order to mitigate these material weaknesses to the fullest extent possible we engage a third-party accounting firm to provide additional
expertise in accounting. If at any time, we determine a new control can be implemented to mitigate these risks at a reasonable cost,
it is implemented as soon as possible. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to Commission rules that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that
section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless
of any general incorporation language in such filing. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Board
Composition 

Our
bylaws provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, with such number to be determined by the Board of Directors.
The whole Board of Directors currently consists of seven members. In accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. At each annual general meeting of stockholders, the successors to directors whose
terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election.
Our directors will be divided among the three classes as follows: 

The
 Class I directors are Don Patterson and Michael Garff. Their terms will expire at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders tentatively
 slated for June 2023 

The
 Class II directors are Jim Hogan and Aaron Dorny. Their terms will expire at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders 

The
 Class III directors are David Nielsen, Rich McKeown and Jared Bauer. Their terms will expire at the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders. 

We
expect that any additional directorships resulting from an increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among
the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. The division of our Board of
Directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control. 

Director
Independence 

Our
Board of Directors has undertaken a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. 

Based
upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including
family relationships, our Board of Directors has determined that Jim Hogan, David Nielsen, and Rich McKeown representing three of our
seven directors, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined in the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The remaining Board of Directors have determined that Jared Bauer (CEO), Michael Garff (COO), Aaron Dorny and Don Patterson
are not independent under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, respectively. In making this determination, our Board of Directors
considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances
our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by
each non-employee director. 

Board
Committees 

Our
Board of Directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee a nominating and governance committee and a science and
technology committee. Our Board of Directors may establish other committees to facilitate the management of our business. The composition

qualifications and independence of our independent auditors and our internal financial and accounting controls. The audit committee has
direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention (including termination) and oversight of our independent auditors,
and our independent auditors report directly to the audit committee. The audit committee also prepares the audit committee report that
the SEC requires to be included in our annual proxy statement. 

Our
audit committee consists of Don Patterson (chair), Aaron Dorny and Michael Garff. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Patterson,
Mr. Dorny and Mr. Garff are independent under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
The chair of our audit committee is Mr. Patterson. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Patterson is an audit committee
financial expert as such term is currently defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulations S-K. Our Board of Directors has also determined
that each member of our audit committee can read and understand fundamental financial statements, in accordance with applicable requirements.
In arriving at these determinations, the Board of Directors has examined each audit committee member s scope of experience and
the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector. 

Finance
and Compensation Committee

compensation committee approves the compensation objectives for the Company, the compensation of the chief executive officer and approves,
or recommends to our Board of Directors for approval, the compensation for other executives. The compensation committee reviews all compensation
components, including base salary, bonus, benefits and other perquisites. 

Our
compensation committee consists of Jim Hogan (chair), David Nielsen and Rich McKeown. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr.
Hogan, Mr. Nielsen and Mr. McKeown are independent and are non-employee directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and are outside directors as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the US Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, or Section 162(m). The chair of our compensation committee is Mr. Hogan. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all our directors, officers and employees, including our principal
executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions,
and agents and representatives. The full text of our code of business conduct and ethics is posted on our website at www.prolunginc.com.
The nominating and governance committee of our Board of Directors will be responsible for overseeing our code of business conduct and
ethics and any waivers applicable to any director, executive officer or employee. 

We
intend to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our code of business conduct and ethics, or waivers of such provisions
applicable to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, and agents and representatives, on our website identified
above. 

Involvement
in Legal Proceedings

the best of our knowledge, four of our former directors and our current CEO have, during the past ten years, been involved in legal proceedings
described in subparagraph (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K. 

On

to Show Cause before the Division of Securities of the Department of Commerce of the State of Utah against the Company, Jared Bauer and
former Board Members (Clark Campbell, Tim Treu, Todd Morgan and Robert Raybould). 

46 

In
January 2020, the Division issued a Stipulation and Consent Order which set forth the following: 1) the Company agrees to settle the
matter with the Division by way of the Stipulation and Consent Order; 2) the Stipulation and Consent Order fully resolves all claims
the Division has against the Company pertaining to the Order to Show Cause; 3) the Division, ProLung and Bauer, agree to promptly file
a stipulation and joint motion to dismiss ProLung and Bauer from this administrative action, with respect to Count 1 against ProLung
and Bauer (the only claim brought against Bauer); 4) In or about April 2014, the Company Board of Directors circulated a consent agreement
regarding the issuance of 582,102 (72,763 post-split) ProLung stock certificates to select members of the ProLung Board of Directors
in connection with financing services provided by those members; 5) In or about April 2014, ProLung issued stock grants
of 216,000 (27,000 post-split) shares to Robert W. Raybould, 16,350 (2,044 post-split) shares to Steve Eror, 63,750 (7,968 post-split)
shares to Treu; 193,500 (24,118 post-split) shares to Campbell; and 97,500 (12,188 post-split) shares to Morgan; 6) Subsequent to issuance

to the Company. However, Raybould, Treu, Campbell and Morgan did not return their shares to the Company. ProLung did not disclose the
potential licensing violation until on or about December 3, 2018, in its Note Purchase Agreements.

set forth by the Company in its Form 8-K dated November 27, 2019, Campbell, Treu, Morgan, and Raybould entered into Stipulation and Consent
Orders wherein they returned shares of stock to the Company s treasury and paid fines to the Division of Securities. 

On
January 9, 2020, the Division entered an order as follows: 1) entering certain Findings and Conclusions by the Division, which ProLung
admitted via a Stipulation and Consent Order; 2) ordering ProLung to cease and desist from violating Utah Uniform Securities Act (the
 Act and to comply with the requirements of the Act in all future business in the state of Utah; 3)
ordering ProLung to disclose the contents of the order to investors and prospective investors in all future capital raising efforts and
disclosure documents of ProLung; and 4) Ordering ProLung to pay a fine of 55,000 to the Division.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of ProLung, Inc.: 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ProLung, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related
statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Regarding Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial and recurring losses to date from operations, continues to have a
stockholders deficit and is currently dependent on debt and equity financing, which creates substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical matter
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Valuation
of Equity-Based Instruments 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

During
the year ending December 31, 2022, the Company issued common stock and stock options which required management to assess the fair value
of these instruments in order to record and disclose the equity-based compensation in these transactions. The Company s stock does
not actively trade on an active market. The Company utilized a valuation methodology that incorporated various assumptions including
replacement cost and also utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of the Company s
common stock. 

We
identified auditing the valuation of the equity-based compensation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgements used
by the Company in determining the value of its common stock. Auditing the determination and valuation of the common stock involved a
high degree of auditor judgement, specialized skills and knowledge. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
audit procedures related to the following: 

We evaluated
 the reasonableness and appropriateness of the choice of valuation methodology and model used for valuing the common stock. 

We tested the reasonableness
 of the assumptions used by the Company in the valuation model, including scenario weighting, replacement cost assumptions and discount
 rates. 

We tested the accuracy
 and completeness of data used in developing the assumptions used in the valuation model. 

We evaluated the accuracy
 and completeness of the Company s presentation of these instruments in the financial statements and related disclosures, including
 evaluating whether such disclosures were in accordance with relevant accounting standards. 

Professionals with specialized
 skill and knowledge were utilized by the Firm to assist in the evaluation of the valuation models deployed by management. 

/s/

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.
