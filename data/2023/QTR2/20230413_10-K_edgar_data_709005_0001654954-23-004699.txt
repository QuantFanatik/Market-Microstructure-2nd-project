BUSINESS General Information Noble Roman s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972, sells and services franchises and licenses and operates Company-owned stand-alone restaurants and non-traditional foodservice operations under the trade names Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub, Noble Roman s Pizza, Noble Roman s Take-N-Bake, and Tuscano s Italian Style Subs. References in this report to the Company are to Noble Roman s, Inc. and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, RH Roanoke, Inc. and Pizzaco, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise. RH Roanoke, Inc. operates a Company-owned non-traditional location. Pizzaco, Inc. currently is dormant. The Company has been operating, franchising and licensing Noble Roman s Pizza operations in a variety of stand-alone and non-traditional locations across the country since 1972. Its first Craft Pizza Pub location opened in January 2017 as a Company-operated restaurant in a northern suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. Since then, the Company opened a total of eight more Company-operated locations in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2021, with additional locations under consideration. The Company-operated locations serve as the base for what it sees as a significant potential future growth driver, including additional Company operated locations and franchising its full-service restaurant format to experienced, multi-unit restaurant operators with a track record of success. In 2019 the Company executed an agreement with the first franchise operator, Indiana s largest Dairy Queen franchisee with 19 franchised Dairy Queen locations at that time. The franchisee opened the first franchised Craft Pizza Pub location in May 2019 and another location in November 2020. In November 2019, another franchisee, with an operations background in McDonald s, opened a Craft Pizza Pub in Evansville, Indiana. As discussed below under Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic the COVID-19 pandemic materially affected the Company s business and its franchising strategy since the pandemic emerged during the first quarter of 2020. Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub The Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub format incorporates many of the basic elements first introduced in 1972 but in a modern atmosphere with up-to-date baking technology and equipment to maximize speed, enhance quality and perpetuate the taste customers love and expect from a Noble Roman s. The Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub provides for a selection of over 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose. Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections. Wines include 16 affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals. Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room. The Company designed the system to enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running approximately 2.5 minutes for traditional pizzas and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pizzas. Popular pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu but also offered is a selection of Craft Pizza Pub original pizza creations. The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads and fresh-cooked pasta. The menu also incorporates baked sub sandwiches, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman s famous Breadsticks with Spicy Cheese Sauce, most of which has been offered in its locations since 1972. In 2022, new salad bars were rolled out over time across all Company-operated restaurants. 3 Table of Contents Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed Dough Room where Noble Roman s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view. Kids and adults enjoy Noble Roman s self-serve root beer tap, which is also part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area there are many giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman s since 1972. The Company designed its curbside service for carry-out customers, called Pizza Valet Service, to create added value and convenience. With Pizza Valet Service, customers place orders ahead, drive into the restaurant s reserved valet parking spaces and have their pizza run to their vehicle by specially uniformed pizza valets. Customers who pay when they place their orders are able to drive up and leave with their order very quickly without stepping out of their vehicle. For those who choose to pay after they arrive, pizza valets can take credit card payments on their mobile payment devices right at the customer s vehicle. With the fast baking times, the entire experience, from order to pick-up can take as little as 12 minutes. Noble Roman s Pizza For Non-Traditional Locations In 1997, the Company started franchising non-traditional locations (a Noble Roman s pizza operation within some other host business or activity with existing traffic) such as entertainment facilities, hospitals, convenience stores and other types of facilities. These locations utilize the two pizza styles the Company started with in 1972, along with its great tasting, high quality ingredients and menu extensions. The hallmark of Noble Roman s Pizza for non-traditional locations is Superior quality that our customers can taste. Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results. A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product, which otherwise is a challenge in non-traditional locations. Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues. 100 real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no additives or extenders. 100 real meat toppings, with no soy additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts. Vegetables (like onions and green peppers) and mushrooms for pizzas are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned. An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products. The fully-prepared crust also forms the basis for the Company s Take-N-Bake pizza for use as an add-on component for its non-traditional franchise and licensing base. Business Strategy The Company is focused on revenue expansion while carefully managing corporate-level overhead expenses. To accomplish this, the Company plans to continue developing, owning and operating Craft Pizza Pub locations and franchising that format to qualified multi-unit franchisees. At the same time, the Company will continue to focus on franchising/licensing for non-traditional locations by franchising that format primarily to convenience stores and entertainment centers. 4 Table of Contents The initial franchise fees for a Noble Roman s Pizza non-traditional location or a Craft Pizza Pub location are as follows: Non-Traditional Except Hospitals Non-Traditional Hospitals Traditional Stand-Alone Either a Noble Roman s Pizza or Craft Pizza Pub 7,500 10,000 30,000 (1) (1) With the sale of multiple traditional stand-alone franchises to a single franchisee, the franchise fee for the first unit is 30,000, the franchise fee for the second unit is 25,000 and the franchise fee for the third unit and any additional unit is 20,000. The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party. The Company s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer. The Company utilizes distributors it has strategically identified in areas across the United States where Company-owned and franchise operations are located. The distributor agreements require the distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries. Competition The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company s competitors are very large, internationally established companies. Within the environment in which the Company competes, management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company. Many of the Company s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations. This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves. The Company s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees. 5 Table of Contents The Company s Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub format competes with similar restaurants in its service area. Some of the competitors are company-owned, some are franchised locations of large chains and others are independently owned. Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. Seasonality of Sales Inclement or unusually cold winter weather conditions tend to adversely affect sales, especially those of the Craft Pizza Pubs which are primarily designed for in-store dining and carry-out, which in turn affects Company revenue. Initial nice spring weather may also adversely affect sales in Craft Pizza Pub locations as people first start to spend time outside. Sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by weather and holiday periods. Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year. Product sales of the non-traditional franchises/licenses may be slower during the first quarter of the year. Human Capital As of March 1, 2023, the Company employed approximately 44 persons full-time and 163 persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 14 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and 30 in restaurant locations. No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good. Trademarks and Service Marks The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks. Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN S , Noble Roman s Pizza , THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE , Noble Roman s Take-N-Bake Pizza, Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub , Pizza Valet and Tuscano s Italian Style Subs , are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments. The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts. Government Regulation The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of the respective businesses. Each location, including the Company s Craft Pizza Pub locations, are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, employment, alcohol and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as third parties that produce and distribute products the Company and its franchisees and licensees sell are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the U. S. Department of Transportation. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters.The Company is subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 6 Table of Contents The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission FTC and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic In the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged and spread throughout the United States. The World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. In response to the pandemic, the U.S. federal government and various state and local governments have, among other things, imposed travel and business restrictions, including stay-at-home orders and other guidelines that required restaurants and bars to close or restrict inside dining. The pandemic resulted in significant, economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, reduced commercial activity and weakened economic conditions in the regions in which the Company and its franchisees operate. The pandemic and the governmental response had a significant adverse impact on the Company, due to, among other things, governmental restrictions, reduced customer traffic, staffing challenges and supply difficulties especially as a result of the emergence of the Omicron and other variants of COVID-19 in late 2021 and early in 2022. Many states and municipalities in the United States, including Indiana where all of the Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub restaurants are located, have from time to time temporarily restricted travel and suspended the operations of dine-in restaurants and other businesses in light of COVID-19 which negatively affected the Company s operations. As the duration and scope of the pandemic is uncertain these orders are subject to further modification, which could adversely affect the Company. Further, the Company can provide no assurance the phase out of restrictions will have a positive effect on the Company s business. Host facilities for the Company s non-traditional franchises were also affected by labor shortages which adversely impacted those developments and in turn slowed the sales of franchises. The uncertainty and disruption in the U.S. economy caused by the pandemic are likely to continue to adversely impact the volume and resources of potential franchisees for both the Company s Craft Pizza Pub and non-traditional venues. On February 5, 2021, the Company received a loan of 940,734 under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), which was in addition to prior PPP loans. In accordance with the applicable accounting policy adopted, the Company accounted for the loan as a government grant and presented it in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a reduction of certain qualifying expenses incurred during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. The expenses included payroll costs and benefits, interest on mortgage obligations, rent under lease agreements and utilities and other qualifying expenses pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). Because the 940,734 loan was applied against relevant expenses in the first quarter 2021, the result of operations for the 12-month periods in 2021 and 2022 are of limited comparability. 7 Table of Contents The employee retention credit ERC is a refundable tax credit that businesses can claim on qualified wages paid to employees. The program was introduced on March 27, 2020 in the CARES Act to incentivize employees to keep their employees on their payroll during the pandemic and economic shutdown. The credit applies to all qualified wages, including certain health plan expenses, paid during the period in which the operations were fully or partially suspended due to a government shutdown order or where there was significant decline in gross receipts. When first established under the CARES Act, the tax credit was equal to 50 of the qualified wages an eligible employer paid to employees after March 12, 2020 and before January 1, 2021. The credit was also limited to a maximum annual per employee credit of 5,000. The credit was then extended through June 30, 2021 by the Tax Payer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act Relief Act (Division EE of the Consolidated Appropriations Act). The Relief Act modified the credit to be 70 of up to 10,000 of qualified wages per quarter in 2021 through June 30, 2021. The program was further extended through December 31, 2021 by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ARPA but was retroactively cut short by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, ending effective September 30, 2021. During the first quarter of 2023 the Company determined that it is entitled to an ERC of 1.718 million and has submitted amended federal Form 941 returns claiming that refund. The ERC refund is treated as a government grant and will be reducing appropriate expenses for the 1.718 million less expenses for applying for the refund of 258,000 or a net of 1.460 million.

RISK FACTORS All phases of the Company s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are outside of its control, and any one or a combination of which could materially affect its results of operations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company s expectations are discussed below. Prospective investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in our securities as well as the information set forth under Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of this report. These risks and uncertainties include: Risks Related to Economic Conditions and Events. COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental response had a significant adverse impact on the Company, due to among other things, governmental restrictions, reduced customer traffic, staffing challenges and supply difficulties especially as a result of the emergence of the Omicron and other variants of COVID-19 in late 2021 and early 2022. Many states and municipalities in the United States, including Indiana where all of the Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub restaurants are located, have from time to time suspended the operation of dine-in restaurants and other businesses in light of COVID-19, which negatively affected the Company s operations. As the duration and scope of the pandemic is uncertain, these orders are subject to further modifications which could adversely affect the Company and its ability to execute its growth plans. Further the Company can provide no assurance the phase-out of restrictions will have a positive effect on the Company s business. 8 Table of Contents Host facilities for the Company s non-traditional franchises were also affected by labor shortages which adversely impacted those developments and in turn slowed the sale of franchises. The uncertainty and disruption in the U.S. economy caused by the pandemic are likely to continue to adversely impact the volume and resources of potential franchisees for both the Company s Craft Pizza Pub and non-traditional venues. The Company has experienced several disruptions in supply including due to the temporary closure of certain meat processors. The Company has implemented alternative work-arounds for these disruptions but could face additional supply disruptions to a minor or major degree which could impact the Company s ability to serve products with the impacted ingredients. The potential of such disruptions has prompted the Company-operated units to take on a larger than normal supply of certain key ingredients. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any lingering economic, labor and supply chain upheaval, the Company s ability to execute its growth plans could be adversely affected. These risks and any additional risks associated with COVID-19 or a similar outbreak may materially adversely affect the Company s business or results of operations, and may impact the Company s liquidity or financial condition, particularly if these risks persist for a significant amount of time. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected the Company s franchising business due to its impact on the operations and financial condition of host facilities as well as constraints on the Company s historical marketing efforts, including participation in trade shows. Competition from larger companies. The Company competes with large national companies and numerous regional and local companies for franchise and license sales and with respect to its Company-owned locations. Many of its competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The restaurant industry in general is intensely competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of several factors, including product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Activities of the Company s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses or maintain and renew existing franchises and licenses or the operating results of the Company s system. Dependence on growth strategy. The Company s growth strategies include selling new franchises or licenses for non-traditional locations and to expand Craft Pizza Pub locations in the future by franchising to qualified franchisees and gradually increasing the number of Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub locations. The opening and success of new locations will depend upon various factors, which include: (1) the traffic generated by and viability of the underlying activity or business in non-traditional locations; (2) the continued viability of the Craft Pizza Pub locations; (3) the ability of the franchisees and licensees of either venue to operate their locations effectively; (4) the franchisee s ability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and (5) the effect of competition and general economic and business conditions including food and labor costs. Many of the foregoing factors are not within the Company s complete control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its plans with respect to the opening and/or operation of new franchises/licenses for Craft Pizza Pub or non-traditional locations. 9 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Company s Operations Dependence on success of franchisees and licensees. While an increasing portion of its revenues are being generated by Company-owned operations, a significant portion of the Company s revenues continues to come from royalties and other fees generated by its franchisees and licensees which are independent operators. Their employees are not the Company s employees. The Company is dependent on the franchisees to accurately report their weekly sales and, consequently, the calculation of royalties. If the franchisees underreport their sales, the Company s revenue could be adversely affected. The Company provides training and support to franchisees and licensees but the quality of the store operations and collectability of the receivables may be diminished by a number of factors beyond the Company s control. Consequently, franchisees and licensees may not operate locations in a manner consistent with the Company s standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they do not, the Company s image and reputation may suffer, and its revenues and stock price could decline. While the Company attempts to ensure that its franchisees and licensees maintain the quality of its brand and branded products, franchisees and licensees may take actions that adversely affect the value of the Company s intellectual property or reputation. Overall inflation, initiatives to increase the Federal minimum wage and a shortage of available labor could have an adverse financial effect on our franchisees/licensees or the Company by increasing labor and other costs. Dependence on distributors. The success of the Company s license and franchise offerings depends upon the Company s ability to engage and retain unrelated, third-party distributors. The Company s distributors collect and remit certain of the Company s royalties and must reliably stock and deliver products to the Company s licensees and franchisees as well as the Company-owned operations. The Company s inability to engage and retain quality distributors, or a failure by distributors to perform in accordance with the Company s standards, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The COVID-19 pandemic had a materially adverse impact on many of the Company s current distributors as well as other potential distributors, especially those located in or servicing states that had or have significant and/or prolonged restrictions. These potential disruptions in distribution may result in loss of distribution to some areas or result in distribution service under less favorable terms to the Company and its franchisees and licensees. Dependence on consumer preferences and perceptions. The restaurant industry and the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. The Company could be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality, illness, an infection pandemic, injury, other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or retail outlet or a limited number of restaurants and retail outlets. 10 Table of Contents Interruptions in supply or delivery of food products. Dependence on frequent deliveries of product from unrelated third-party manufacturers through unrelated third-party distributors also subjects the Company to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by contractual interruptions, market conditions, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. The COVID-19 pandemic created supply chain shortages that adversely impacted the Company s operations. In addition, factors such as inflation, which has intensified significantly since the beginning of 2021, market conditions for cheese, wheat, meats, paper, labor and other items may also adversely affect the franchisees and licensees and, as a result, can adversely affect the Company s ability to add new franchised or licensed locations. Federal, state and local laws with regard to the operation of the businesses. The Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company would be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchise units. Each franchise and Company-owned location is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, alcohol, employment and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a franchise location. Vendors, such as the Company s third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees and its vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. Failure of the Company or its franchisees to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on the Company, its operations, financial results or reputation. Additionally, expenses related to compliance with these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial results. Risks Related to the Company s Indebtedness Ability to service our outstanding indebtedness and the dilutive effect of our outstanding warrants. As of March 15, 2023, the Company has approximately 9.0 million in principal amount debt obligations. Of that debt, 8.4 million is in the form of a senior secured promissory note (the Senior Note and 625,000 is in the form of convertible, subordinated, unsecured promissory notes (the Notes ), each as described below. On February 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Promissory Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P. (the Purchaser ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company issued to the Purchaser the Senior Note in the initial principal amount of 8.0 million. The Company has used the net proceeds of the Agreement as follows: (i) 4.2 million was used to repay the Company s then-existing bank debt which was in the original amount of 6.1 million; (ii) 1.275 million was used to repay the portion of the Company s outstanding subordinated convertible debt the maturity date of which most had not previously been extended; (iii) debt issuance costs; and (iv) the remaining net proceeds were used for working capital or other general corporate purposes, including development of new Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub locations. 11 Table of Contents The Senior Note bears cash interest of LIBOR, as defined in the Agreement, plus 7.75 . Interest is payable in arrears on the last calendar day of each month. In addition, the Note requires non-cash payment-in-kind interest PIK Interest of 3 per annum, which is added to the principal amount of the Senior Note. The Senior Note matures on February 7, 2025. Beginning February 28, 2023, the Senior Note as amended also requires fixed principal payments in the amount of 33,333 per month during February 2023 and 83,333 per month continuing until maturity. At the end of the third quarter 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Note agreement changing the required payments of principal beginning in March 2023 from 33,333 per month to 83,333 per month in exchange for lowering the financial covenants and eliminating the excess cash flow requirement. In addition, when LIBOR is phased out it will be replaced with SOFR. In conjunction with the Senior Note, the Company issued to the Purchaser a warrant (the Corbel Warrant to purchase up to 2,250,000 shares of Common Stock. The Corbel Warrant entitles the Purchaser to purchase from the Company, at any time or from time to time: (i) 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.57 per share Tranche 1 ), (ii) 900,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.72 per share Tranche 2 ), and (iii) 150,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.97 per share Tranche 3 ). The Purchaser is required to exercise the Corbel Warrant with respect to Tranche 1 if the Common Stock is trading at 1.40 per share or higher for a specified period, and is further required to exercise the Corbel Warrant with respect to Tranche 2 if the Common Stock is trading at 1.50 per share or higher for a specified period. Cashless exercise of the Corbel Warrant is only permitted with respect to Tranche 3. The Purchaser has the right, within six months after the issuance of any shares under the Corbel Warrant, to require the Company to repurchase such shares for cash or for put notes, at the Company s discretion. The Corbel Warrant expires on the sixth anniversary of the date of its issuance. Additionally, the Company previously issued certain units (the Units consisting of a Note in an aggregate principal amount of 50,000 and warrants (the Warrants to purchase up to 50,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at a price of 1.00 per share, no par value per share. Following the refinancing described above, 625,000 in principal amount of Notes and the associated Warrants remain outstanding, however, per the terms of the agreement, the Warrants were re-priced to 0.57 per share. Notes with an outstanding principal balance of 150,000 matured and accompanying Warrants expired January 31, 2023; however, the principal amount of such Notes cannot be repaid until Corbel s loan is paid because the Notes are subordinate to such loan. Notes with an outstanding principal balance of 475,000, and accompanying Warrants, have been extended to February 28, 2025. Risks Related to Human Capital Dependence on key executives. The Company s business has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive staff generally, and particularly Paul W. Mobley, its Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, its President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Risks Related to the Company s Common Stock Indiana law with regard to purchases of the Company s stock. Certain provisions of Indiana law applicable to the Company could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of its Common Stock. These provisions include prohibitions against certain business combinations with persons or groups of persons that become interested shareholders (persons or groups of persons who are beneficial owners of shares with voting power equal to 10 or more) unless the board of directors approves either the business combination or the acquisition of stock before the person becomes an interested shareholder. 12 Table of Contents Inapplicability of corporate governance standards that apply to companies listed on a national exchange. The Company s stock is quoted on the OTCQB, a Nasdaq-sponsored and operated inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not included on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company is not subject to the same corporate governance requirements that apply to exchange-listed companies. These requirements include: (1) a majority of independent directors; (2) an audit committee of independent directors; and (3) shareholder approval of certain equity compensation plans or equity issuances. As a result, stockholders do not have the same governance protection as they would for a stock traded on a national exchange. Thinly traded stock The market for the Common Stock is limited, meaning that an investment in the Company s stock is less liquid than in a stock listed on a national exchange with a higher average trading volume. Because of this, attempts by one or more stockholders of the Company to sell significant amounts of stock may result in an imbalance in the market that materially decreases the trading price of the stock which could continue for an indefinite period of time. Accordingly, the traded price of the stock may not reflect the Company s equity value. Additionally, there is no assurance that the Company s stock will continue to be authorized for quotation by the OTCQB or any other market in the future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.

The employee stock option plan does not limit the number of shares that may be issued under the plan. ITEM 6. RESERVED ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction The Company currently owns and operates nine Craft Pizza Pub locations and one non-traditional location in a hospital. Craft Pizza Pub is designed to have a fun, pleasant atmosphere serving pizza and other related menu items, all made fresh using fresh ingredients in the view of the customers for inside dining and offers Pizza Valet service for a quick, easy and fun way to provide carry-out for those customers who want to dine elsewhere. These units operate under the trade name Noble Roman s Craft Pizza Pub . The Company also sells and services franchises and licenses for non-traditional foodservice operations under the trade names Noble Roman s Pizza and Noble Roman s Take-N-Bake. The non-traditional concepts hallmarks include high quality pizza along with other related menu items, simple operating systems, fast service times, labor-minimizing operations, attractive food costs and overall affordability. During the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022 there were no company-operated or franchised Craft Pizza Pub restaurants opened or closed. During the same 12-month period there were 31 new non-traditional outlets opened and seven non-traditional outlets closed. The Company, at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, had deferred tax assets on its balance sheet totaling 3.2 million and 3.5 million, respectively, after adding a tax benefit in 2022 of 292,435. Based on the Company s review of its available tax credits and 2022 tax benefit, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration. 15 Table of Contents Financial Summary The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The Company evaluates the carrying values of its assets, including property, equipment and related costs, accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, periodically to assess whether any impairment indications are present due to (among other factors) recurring operating losses, significant adverse legal developments, competition, changes in demand for the Company s products or changes in the business climate that affect the recovery of recorded values. If any impairment of an individual asset is evident, a charge will be recorded to reduce the carrying value to its estimated fair value.

The Company, in the first quarter of 2023, submitted amended federal Form 941 returns for 2020 and 2021 to obtain a credit under the ERC of 1.718 million which will be reduced by 258,000 commission for a net of 1.460 million. While the ERC is applied to prior periods and is recorded as a reduction of expenses in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to be received within a few months. (2) Decreases in revenue for both the three-month and 12-month periods were the result of an adjustment of prior years allowances of approximately 140,000 and additional adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately 235,000 as a reserve against possible uncollectables, which in the opinion of management were not necessary except to be ultra conservative. (3) The income tax benefit in both the three-montha and 12-month ended December 31, 2022 was reduced by 150,000 to lower the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet. 17 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company s Craft Pizza Pub locations and the percent relationship to its revenue: Three Months ended December 31, Year-Ended December 31, Description 2021 2022 2021 2022 Revenue 2,443,781 100 2,330,026 100 8,939,569 100 9,704,169 100 Cost of sales 513,848 21.0 513,636 22.0 1,868,997 20.9 2,076,514 21.4 Salaries and wages 743,396 30.5 694,600 29.8 2,233,376 25.0 2,850,333 29.4 Facility cost including rent, common area and utilities 379,851 15.5 403,592 17.3 1,187,984 13.3 1,635,951 16.8 Packaging 87,317 3.6 85,433 3.7 271,507 3.0 344,823 3.6 All other operating expenses 442,063 18.1 402,467 17.3 1,662,969 18.6 1,608,784 16.5 Total expenses 2,166,475 88.7 2,099,726 90.1 7,224,833 80.8 8,516,405 87.7 Margin contribution 277,306 11.3 230,301 9.9 1,714,736 19.2 1,187,764 12.3 The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company s franchising venue and the percent relationship to its revenue: Three Months ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Description 2021 2022 2021 2022 Royalties and fees franchising 860,192 84.8 627,719 80.0 3,816,164 85.8 3,371,643 84.2 Royalties and fees grocery 153,639 15.2 156,704 20.0 628,662 14.2 631,181 15.8 Total royalties and fees 1,013,831 100 784,423 100 4,444,826 100 4,002,824 100 Salaries and wages 215,656 21.3 223,495 28.5 719,252 16.2 861,190 21.5 Trade show expense 105,000 10.4 90,000 11.5 399,000 9.0 315,000 7.9 Travel and auto 21,446 2.1 32,028 4.1 73,270 1.6 113,186 2.8 All other op. expenses 154,789 15.2 396,155 50.5 618,841 13.9 896,375 22.4 Total expenses 496,891 49.0 741,678 94.6 1,810,363 40.7 2,185,751 54.6 Margin contribution 516,940 51.0 42,745 5.4 2,634,463 59.3 1,817,073 45.4 18 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the revenue, expense and margin contribution of the Company-owned non-traditional venue and the percent relationship to its revenue: Three Months ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Description 2021 2022 2021 2022 Revenue 131,978 100 206,625 100 485,595 100 712,517 100 Total expenses 131,890 99.9 201,026 97.3 466,469 96.1 704,665 98.9 Margin contribution 88 .1 5,599 2.7 19,126 3.9 7,852 1.1 Results of Operations Company-Owned Craft Pizza Pub The revenue from this venue decreased from 2.4 million to 2.3 million for the fourth quarter and grew from 8.9 million to 9.7 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in the three-month period and the increase in the 12-month period was same store sales reduction in the fourth quarter as a result of being in the opening period for two locations last year, and the increase in year-to-date was same store sales increases. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased from 21.0 to 22.0 in the fourth quarter and from 20.9 to 21.4 , respectively, for the comparable periods in 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were the result of increased prices on most ingredients, which were partially offset by menu price increases. Salaries and wages as a percentage of revenue decreased from 30.5 to 29.8 in the fourth quarter and increased from 25.0 to 29.4 for the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. This decrease in the fourth quarter was the result of scheduling efficiencies and a slight easing in the labor market and the increase in the annual cost was primarily the effect of the PPP loan in 2021 which reduced certain expenses including salaries and wages. Facility costs, including rent, common area maintenance and utilities, as a percentage of revenue increased from 15.5 to 17.3 and from 13.3 to 16.89 of revenue for the respective three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The primary reason for the increase in both periods were two locations that opened during the fourth quarter 2021. All other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 18.1 to 17.3 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 and from 18.6 to 16.5 for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The decreases were the result of more efficient operations as the locations had been there longer combined with menu price increases. Gross margin contribution decreased from 11.3 to 9.9 and from 19.2 to 12.3 for the respective three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The decreases in margin were primarily the result of increase in wages and other costs due to inflationary pressures only partially offset by menu price increases. The Company initiated a second price increase during the second quarter of 2022 to help offset the continued cost pressures. The largest impact on the 12-month period was the impact of the PPP loan in 2021 used to offset certain expenses. 19 Table of Contents Franchising Revenue and Expense Total revenue from this venue declined from 1.01 million to 784,000 and from 4.4 million to 4.0 million for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. Many of the grocery stores that previously offered take-n-bake were not offering take-n-bake at this time because of operational demands on the grocery stores and a shortage of available labor. Decreases in revenue for both the three-month and 12-month periods were the result of an adjustment of prior years allowances of approximately 140,000 and additional adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately 235,000 as a reserve against possible uncollectables, which in the opinion of management were not necessary except to be ultra conservative. The decrease was also caused by a number of locations that had to be closed because of COVID restrictions partially offset by an increase in revenue from other existing locations. Gross margin in this venue decreased from 51.0 to 5.4 and from 59.3 to 49.4 for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The decrease in gross margin for both periods was a decrease in revenue of approximately 140,000 and an increase in expense of approximately 235,000 as explained in the previous paragraph. Going forward this venue has been showing new growth activity and both the revenue and margin is expected to achieve or exceed historic levels in upcoming periods. Company-Owned Non-Traditional Locations Gross revenue from this venue increased from 132,000 to 207,000 and from 486,000 to 713,000 for the respective three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022 compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. This venue consists of one location in a hospital. Access to the hospital had been very limited and movement within the hospital was prohibited because of the potential spread of COVID-19, and revenue increased as those restrictions within the hospital were relaxed. The Company does not intend to operate any more Company-owned non-traditional locations except for the one location that is currently being operated. Total expenses increased from 132,000 to 201,000 and from 466,000 to 705,000 for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The primary reason for the increases was increased revenue as the hospital relieved many of their restrictions on access to the hospital and on movement within the hospital, as discussed in the previous paragraph, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Corporate Expenses Depreciation and amortization decreased from 400,000 to 113,000 and from 849,000 to 451,000 for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. These decreases were the result of opening costs for new Company-owned locations of Craft Pizza Pub restaurants becoming fully expensed prior to 2022. General and administrative expenses increased from 504,000 to 569,000 and from 1.79 million to 2.17 million for the three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The increase reflected general inflation pressures as well as the growth of the Craft Pizza Pub venue. 20 Table of Contents Interest expense increased from 345,000 to 559,000 and from 1.36 million to 1.63 million for the respective three-month and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2021. The primary reason for the increase in both periods was the compounding of the PIK interest on the Senior Note and the increase in interest rate. In 2023, the interest cost should decline gradually as a result of the required principal payment on the note which should more than offset the additional interest because of compounding of the PIK notes. During the first quarter of 2023 the Company determined that it is entitled to an ERC of 1.718 million and has submitted amended federal Form 941 returns claiming that refund. The ERC refund is treated as a government grant reducing appropriate expenses for the 1.718 million less expenses for applying for the refund of 258,000 or a net of 1.460 million. Recording this refund in the first quarter of 2023 will result in significantly improved margins in the Company-owned Craft Pizza and Pub, Franchising Revenue and Expense, Company-Owned Non-Traditional Locations and Corporate Expenses. Impact of Inflation The primary inflation factors affecting both Company and franchised operations are food and labor costs. Cheese makes up the single largest ingredient cost on a pizza. Cheese prices have fluctuated substantially for the past several years. In 2015 through 2017, cheese prices averaged 3 below the 10-year average. In 2018, prices further decreased and averaged 6 below the 10-year average. On April 15, 2020, cheese prices hit a record low, since the Company started tracking it in 1999. Since April 2020, cheese gradually increased to a record high, declined somewhat over the latter part of 2020 but remained well above the previous ten-year average causing the ten-year average to shift higher. During 2021, cheese price fluctuated erratically due to the various impacts of COVID-19 modestly above and below the now higher ten-year average. During 2022, cheese prices were well above the ten-year average and ending the year approximately 20 above the ten-year average. So far in 2023, cheese prices are remaining well above the ten-year average but have declined somewhat in recent weeks to about 13.5 above the ten-year average as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company has also been impacted in recent times by inflationary pressures on other commodities, such as pork, beef, chicken and wheat. The Company expects further significant inflationary pricing pressures to occur, at a minimum, in both the wheat and tomato markets as well as beef. Labor costs across the Company s markets generally have seen upward pressure on hourly rates as the unemployment rate decreased and competition for hourly employees increased, which intensified during the post-peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The same applies to salaried management. The Company s Craft Pizza Pub operations currently pay well above minimum wage rates to remain competitive. The Company has experienced similar pressure on management salaries. Future labor cost increases for non-traditional franchisees and licensees may be somewhat mitigated due to the relatively low labor requirements of the Company s franchise concepts. Mounting pressures in the labor markets, with the return of an improved economy, could be a factor in both franchised and Company operations going forward. Should labor costs increase substantially, or if commodity prices for cheese or other ingredients rise significantly, or some combination thereof occurs, restaurants and foodservice concepts, including the Company and its franchisees, would face pressure to increase menu pricing, the feasibility of which could be subject to competitive concerns and customer tolerance. 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s strategy is to grow its business by concentrating on franchising/licensing non-traditional locations, franchising its updated stand-alone concept, Craft Pizza Pub, and operating a limited number of Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub restaurants. The Company added new Company-operated Craft Pizza Pub locations in January and November 2017, January and June 2018, March, October and November 2020, and October and December 2021. The Company added no new Company-operated Craft Pizza Pub locations during 2022; however locations of non-traditional franchising have increased in recent months. The Company is operating one non-traditional location in a hospital and has no plans for operating any additional non-traditional locations. The Company s current ratio was 1.3-to-1 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 2.3-to-1 as of December 31, 2021. The Company s current ratio was negatively impacted by amortization of the Corbel loan which began in February and increased in March 2023. In addition, it was negatively impacted by the approximately 140,000 in prior year allowances and additional adjustments in the fourth quarter of approximately 235,000 as a reserve against possible uncollectables, which in the opinion of management were not necessary except to be ultra conservative. Going forward the current ratio will be significantly improved in the first quarter of 2023 as the Company determined that it is entitled to an ERC of 1.718 million and has submitted amended federal Form 941 returns claiming that refund. The ERC refund is treated as a government grant by reducing appropriate expenses for the 1.718 million less expenses for applying for the refund of 258,000 or a net of 1.460 million. Recording this refund in the first quarter of 2023 will result in significantly improved margins in the Company-owned Craft Pizza and Pub, Franchising Revenue and Expense, Company-Owned Non-Traditional Locations and Corporate Expenses. In January 2017, the Company completed the offering of 2.4 million principal amount of the Notes convertible to Common Stock at 0.50 per share and Warrants to purchase up to 2.4 million shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of 1.00 per share, subject to adjustment. In 2018, 400,000 principal amount of Notes was converted into 800,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, in January 2019 another Note in the principal amount of 50,000 was converted into 100,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, and in August 2019 another Note in the principal amount of 50,000 was converted into 100,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, leaving principal amounts of Notes of 1.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Holders of Notes in the principal amount of 775,000 extended their maturity date to January 31, 2023. In February 2020, 1,275,000 principal amount of the Notes were repaid in conjunction with a new financing leaving a principal balance of 625,000 of subordinated convertible notes outstanding due January 31, 2023. During 2022, all of those Notes were extended except for Notes with outstanding principal of 150,000 which cannot be repaid until the Corbel Note is repaid. These Notes bear interest at 10 per annum, including the Notes which have not been extended, paid quarterly and are convertible to Common Stock any time prior to maturity at the option of the holder at 0.50 per share. The remaining Warrants to purchase 775,000 shares were re-priced to 0.57 per share as a result of the financing completed in February 2020. On February 7, 2020, the Company entered into the Agreement with Corbel, pursuant to which the Company issued to Corbel the Senior Note in the initial principal amount of 8.0 million. The Company has used the net proceeds of the Agreement as follows: (i) 4.2 million was used to repay the Company s then-existing bank debt which were in the original amount of 6.1 million; (ii) 1,275,000 was used to repay the portion of the Company s existing subordinated convertible debt the maturity date of which most had not previously been extended, (iii) debt issuance costs; and (iv) the remaining net proceeds was used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including development of new Company-owned Craft Pizza Pub locations. 22 Table of Contents The Senior Note bears cash interest of LIBOR, as defined in the Agreement, plus 7.75 . In addition, the Senior Note requires PIK Interest of 3 per annum, which is added to the principal amount of the Senior Note. Interest is payable in arrears on the last calendar day of each month. The Senior Note matures on February 7, 2025. The Senior Note requires principal payments of 33,333 in February 2023 and beginning in March 2023 principal payments of 83,333 per month continuing until maturity. At the end of the third quarter 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Note agreement changing the required payments of principal beginning in March 2023 from 33,333 per month to 83,333 per month in exchange for lowering the financial covenants and eliminating the excess cash flow requirement. In addition, when LIBOR is phased out it will be replaced with SOFR. On April 25, 2020, the Company received a loan of 715,000 under the PPP. In accordance with the applicable accounting policy adopted, the Company accounted for the loan as a government grant and presented it in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as a reduction of certain qualifying expenses incurred during the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. These expenses included payroll costs including payroll benefits, interest on mortgage obligations, rent under lease agreements and utilities and other qualifying expenses pursuant to the CARES Act. On February 19, 2021, the Company received notice from the SBA that the entire 715,000 loan was forgiven in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. On February 5, 2021, the Company received an additional loan of 940,734 under the PPP. The Company used the proceeds of this loan for qualifying expenses under the CARES Act. The Company accounted for this loan as a government grant and presented in the condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as reduction of certain qualifying expenses incurred during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021. On November 19, 2021 the Company received notice from the SBA that the entire 940,734 loan was forgiven in accordance with the provision of the CARES Act. The Company, in the first quarter of 2023, submitted amended federal Form 941 returns for 2020 and 2021 to obtain a credit under the ERC (which is a part of the CARES Act) of 1.718 million which will be reduced by 258,000 commission for a net of 1.461 million. While the ERC is applied to prior periods, the expected net refund was recorded as a reduction in expenses in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to be received within a few months. As a result of the financial arrangements described above and the Company s cash flow projections, the Company believes it will have sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and to carry out its current business plan. The Company s cash flow projections for the next two years are primarily based on the Company s strategy of growing the non-traditional franchising/licensing venues, operating Craft Pizza Pub locations and pursuing a franchising program for Craft Pizza Pub restaurants as market conditions allow. The Company intends to refinance its outstanding debt before the maturity of the Corbel debt in February 2025. The Company does not anticipate that any of the recently issued pronouncements relating to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Operations or its Consolidated Balance Sheet. 23 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth the future contractual obligations of the Company as of March 1, 2023: Less than More than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Long-term debt (1) 9,390,425 866,663 8,523,762 - - Operating leases 5,922,892 732,689 2,626,041 1,611,098 953,063 Total 15,313,317 1,599,352 11,149,803 1,611,098 953,063 (1) The amounts do not include interest.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its variable-rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding variable interest-bearing debt in the aggregate principal amount of 8.4 million. The Company s current borrowings were at a variable rate tied to LIBOR plus 7.25 per annum adjusted on a monthly basis. Based on its current debt structure, for each 1 increase in LIBOR the Company would incur increased interest expense of approximately 85,000 over the succeeding 12-month period. At the end of the third quarter 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the Senior Note agreement changing the required payments of principal beginning in March 2023 from 33,333 per month to 83,333 per month in exchange for lowering the financial covenants and eliminating the excess cash flow requirement.

The Company will continue to pursue collection where circumstances are appropriate and all collections of these receivables in the future will result in additional income at the time received. The Company evaluates its property and equipment and related costs periodically to assess whether any impairment indications are present, including recurring operating losses and significant adverse changes in legal factors or business climate that affect the recovery of recorded value.

Goodwill has an indeterminable life and is assessed for impairment at least annually and more frequently as triggering events may occur. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. Any impairment losses determined to exist are recorded in the period the determination is made. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill and other intangible assets valuation analysis, thus there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated or understated. The Company has elected to perform the annual impairment assessment of recorded goodwill as of the end of the Company s fiscal year. The results of this annual impairment assessment indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit as of December 31, 2022, exceeded the carrying or book value, including goodwill, and therefore recorded goodwill was not subject to impairment. 30 Table of Contents of the deferred tax credits may expire in 2019 and 2020 before they are fully utilized, which increased the Company s tax expense for 2018 and reduced the deferred tax credit on the balance sheet.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s deferred tax asset was 3.4 million at December 31, 2022. We identified the valuation of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter. Specifically, management is required to make significant judgments and assumptions to estimate forecasted taxable income. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Understanding the design of controls relating to management s assessment of forecasted taxable income. Testing the completeness and accuracy of historical taxable income. Evaluating the assessment of forecasted taxable income through consideration of recent performance trends. Valuation of Accounts Receivable As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded its accounts receivable at anticipated realizable value at December 31, 2022. We identified the allowance for doubtful accounts as a critical audit matter. Specifically, management is required to make significant judgments and assumptions to estimate cash flows and evaluate collectability. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Understanding the design of controls relating to management s assessment of estimated cash flow and collectability. Testing the completeness and accuracy of historical collections. Evaluating the assessment of estimated cash flows through consideration of recent performance trends and changes to collectability. We have served as the Company's auditor since 2007. /s/ April 13, 2023 40 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of applicable limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s Auditing Standard No. 5 defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control over reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Our management, including Paul W. Mobley, the Company s Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has concluded that the Company s internal controls over financial reporting are effective. 41 Table of Contents There have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Mobley, the Company s Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective.

The Company has reviewed all transactions to which the Company and officers and directors of the Company are a party or have a financial interest. The board of directors of the Company has adopted a policy that all transactions between the Company and its officers, directors, principal shareholders and other affiliates must be approved by a majority of the Company s disinterested directors, and be conducted on terms no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Of the 48 Units sold in the private placement which began in October 2016, three Units were purchased by Paul W. Mobley, Executive Chairman, and four Units were purchased by Marcel Herbst, Director, via Herbst Capital Management, LLC. Each Unit consists of a Note in the principal amount of 50,000 and a Warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. These transactions were all on the same terms and conditions as all of the independent investors who purchased the other 41 Units. The Notes, at the time of issue, were to mature three years after issue date. In late 2018, the Company sent an offer to each remaining Note holder offering to extend the maturity of the Notes to January 31, 2023. Holders of 775,000 in principal amount of the Notes accepted that offer of extension including the Notes held by Paul W. Mobley and Herbst Capital Management, LLC. In conjunction with the refinancing of the Company in February 2020, Notes held by Paul Mobley were included in the 1,275,000 in principal amount of Notes that were repaid out of the proceeds of the new financing.
