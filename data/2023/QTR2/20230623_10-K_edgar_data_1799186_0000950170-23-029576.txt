 U.S. Bank National Association (the Indenture Trustee ), has provided the information contained in the following paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation AB. 
 U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 
 U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 
 On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction

 capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 
 U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending. 
 U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon (the Owner Trustee and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (the Delaware Trustee has provided the information contained in the following paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation AB. 
 In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., and BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (collectively, BNY Mellon are named as a defendant in legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization RMBS transactions, BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions brought by RMBS investors. These lawsuits allege that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, BNY Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigations vigorously.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors 
 American Honda Finance Corporation: 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that American Honda Finance Corporation (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria) for asset-backed securities transactions for which the Company acted as servicer and administrator involving retail automobile receivables for new and used Honda and Acura vehicles (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023. Appendix B to Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the activities the Company performs are limited to the recording and application of borrower payments as well as the remittance of collections to the Indenture Trustee (as defined in the transaction agreements). With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(ii), the activities the Company performs are limited to disbursements made via wire transfer to the Indenture Trustee (as defined in the transaction agreements). With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii), and 1122(d)(3)(iv), the Company has taken full responsibility except for the portions of those criteria for which the Indenture Trustees have taken responsibility. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria 
 
 applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that American Honda Finance Corporation complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv), for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
