FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
report includes forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as may, 
 will, should, could, would, expect, intend, plan, 
 anticipate, believe, estimate, project, predict, potential 
and similar expressions. These statements are only predictions and involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed. You should not place any undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

You
should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of
factors, including our ability to: 

execute
 our business plan, namely identifying profitable acquisition opportunities, given our limited financial resources 

generate
 sufficient cash flow from our planned operations or other sources to fund our working capital needs, pending completion of an acquisition; 

The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the
statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statements. References in this report to the Company, we, our, and us 
refer to the registrant, Universal Global Hub Inc.

ITEM
1. Business 

Our
Company 

Universal
Global Hub Inc. (the Company or we or us formerly known first as The Enviromart Companies,
Inc. and then as ECARD INC., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2012. On June 21, 2013, the Company
completed an acquisition of intangible assets comprised of intellectual property and trademarks from its former Chief Executive Officer.
In conjunction with the acquisition of the intangible assets, the Company commenced operations. 

As
of January 2, 2015, the Company s business was operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc. Effective
on or about January 15, 2015, the Company changed its name to The Enviromart Companies, Inc. and the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary,
EnviroPack Technologies, Inc., changed its name to Enviromart Industries, Inc. Enviromart Industries ). The Company s
other wholly owned subsidiaries are currently inactive. 

On
October 23, 2017, the Company, changed its name to ECARD INC. . 

On
March 15, 2021, the Company, changed its name to Universal Global Hub Inc. 

Sale
of Operating Business 

On
February 16, 2016, The Rushcap Group, Inc. Rushcap ), an affiliate of Mark Shefts (then a significant shareholder of the
Company), notified us that, effective March 31, 2016, it was discontinuing its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the Inventory
Financing Agreement dated June 19, 2015. 

On
March 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa, our founder and a significant shareholder
of the Company, and Enviromart Industries, Inc., the Company s sole operating subsidiary, pursuant to which the Company agreed
to transfer to Mr. Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries, Inc. 

On
March 17, 2016, our Board approved the sale of our sole operating subsidiary, Enviromart Industries, to Michael R. Rosa, our founder
and a significant shareholder of the Company, as contemplated by that certain Agreement among the Company, Mr. Rosa and Mark Shefts,
dated July 14, 2014 Break-up Agreement ). The Break-up Agreement was originally disclosed in our Current Report on Form
8-K filed July 18, 2014, which is incorporated herein by this reference. 

On
March 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, our sole operating
subsidiary, pursuant to which we transferred to Mr. Rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Enviromart Industries. 

In
consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr. Rosa, he surrendered to us all 13,657,500 shares of the Company s
common stock then owned by him, which shares were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In addition, Mr. Rosa and
Enviromart Industries agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the Company s liabilities existing as the closing date, of
which there was none, as all of the Company s operations have been conducted through Enviromart Industries (its sole operating
subsidiary). 

The
above described purchase and sale transaction closed on July 21, 2016, effective April 1, 2016, and was approved by a majority of the
Company s shareholders by written consent on May 4, 2016. As a result of the completion of the purchase and sale transaction, the
Company s operating business has been discontinued, and it is focusing on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong
growth potential. 

1 

On
October 5, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Eastone SPA with Eastone Equities, LLC, a New
York limited liability company Eastone Equities and certain selling stockholders (the Sellers ), pursuant
to which Eastone Equities acquired 44,566,412 shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares from Sellers for an aggregate
purchase price of 295,000. The transaction contemplated by the Eastone SPA closed on October 9, 2017. The Shares represented approximately
90 of issued and outstanding shares of common of the Company. The transaction resulted in a change in control of the Company. Effective
as of October 23, 2017, the Company changed its name to ECARD INC. 

Following
the closing of the transactions set forth in the Eastone SPA, the Company now has only minimal assets and liabilities. Its operations
are focused on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential. From and after the sale, unless and until the Company
completes an acquisition, its expenses are expected to consist solely of legal, accounting and compliance costs, including those related
to complying with reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange act of 1934. 

We
are now considered a blank check company. The SEC defines those companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny
stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated
that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), we also qualify as a shell company, because we have no or nominal
assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of
securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts
to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We
intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

Our
current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the
Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets
to the Company rather than to merge. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with
any target company. We seek to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose
securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets. 

A
business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and
outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and Board. No assurances can
be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if the Company does enter into such a business combination,
no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company. 

Employees 

The
Company s only employees at the present time are its officers and directors, who will devote as much time as the Board determines
is necessary to carry out the affairs of the Company. 

Available
Information 

The
public may read and copy any materials we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including our Annual
Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to the foregoing, at the SEC s
Public Reference Room at 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 AM to 3 PM. The public
may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet
site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains periodic and current reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding
the Company and other issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Statements
made in this Annual Report which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements with respect to the goals, plan objectives,

Forward-looking
statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: general economic or industry

or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, our ability to raise capital, changes in accounting principles, policies

technical factors affecting our current or potential business and related matters. 

Accordingly,

Overview 

On
June 21, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets from Michael R. Rosa, its chief executive officer, and commenced
business operations. Since completing the acquisition, the Company has raised capital, hired employees, leased space, engaged consultants
and advisors, conducted extensive sales and marketing related activities both domestically and internationally, negotiated vendor relationships
and engaged seller s representatives. 

As
of January 2, 2015, the Company s business was operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, EnviroPack Technologies, Inc. Effective
on or about January 15, 2015, the Company changed its name to The Enviromart Companies, Inc. and the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary,
EnviroPack Technologies, Inc., changed its name to Enviromart Industries, Inc. 

On
October 23, 2017, the Company, with the unanimous approval of its Board by written consent in lieu of a meeting, has changed its name
to ECARD INC. , effective as of October 23, 2017, pursuant to the filing of the Second Certificate of Amendment with the
Secretary of State of Delaware. 

On

Sale
of Operating Business 

On
February 16, 2016, The Rushcap Group, Inc. Rushcap ), an affiliate of Mark Shefts (then a significant shareholder), notified
us that, effective March 31, 2016, it was discontinuing its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the Inventory Financing Agreement
dated June 19, 2015. Rushcap reserved the right to discontinue the funding prior to March 31, 2016, if it so determined. The discontinuation
of funding will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, as we did not believe that
we would be able to timely secure funding to replace the discontinued Inventory Financing. 

5 

In
light of the discontinuation of funding, our Board spent approximately one month assessing the operating company s current business
and funding prospects, including whether to transfer the operating subsidiary to Michael R. Rosa, our founder and a significant shareholder,
in accordance with that certain Agreement between the Company, Mr. Rosa and Mr. Shefts, dated July 14, 2014 Break-up Agreement ).
The Break-up Agreement was disclosed in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 18, 2014, which is incorporated herein
by this reference. 

Our
Board concluded that the discontinuation of funding would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results

March 17, 2016, our Board approved the sale of our sole operating subsidiary, Enviromart Industries, Inc., to Michael R. Rosa, our founder
and a significant shareholder, as contemplated by that certain Agreement between us, Mr. Rosa and Mark Shefts, dated July 14, 2014 Break-up
Agreement ). The Break-up Agreement was originally disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed July 18, 2014, which is incorporated
herein by this reference. 

On
March 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement with Michael R. Rosa and Enviromart Industries, Inc., our sole operating

In
consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to Mr. Rosa, he surrendered to us all 13,657,500 shares of the Company s
common stock then owned by him, which shares have been returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares. In addition, Mr. Rosa
and Enviromart Industries, Inc. (the Companies former operating subsidiary) agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the Company s
liabilities existing as the closing date, of which there were none, as all of the Company s operations have been conducted through
Enviromart Industries, Inc. (its sole operating subsidiary). 

The

operating business has been discontinued, and it will focus on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential.

 ECARD INC. , effective as of October 23, 2017, pursuant to the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of

On
March 15, 2021, the Company, with the unanimous approval of its Board by written consent in lieu of a meeting, has changed its name to
 Universal Global Hub Inc. , effective as of March 15, 2021, pursuant to the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the
Secretary of State of Delaware.

The
Company s common stock is currently quoted on the OTC market (OTCPINK), under the symbol UGHB .

All
of the disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K must be viewed in light of the disposition of our sole operating subsidiary, as
our operating business has been discontinued, and the value of our company is now dependent upon our ability to locate and consummate
the acquisition of an operating business with strong growth potential. 

Results
of Operations 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net loss of 46,344 as compared to a net loss of 42,314 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The increase in loss was due primarily to an increase in operating expenses. This loss is not expected to recur in subsequent periods.
Unless and until the Company completes the acquisition of an operating business, the Company s expenses are expected to consist
of the legal, accounting and administrative costs of maintaining a public company. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were 46,344 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 42,314 for the year ended December 31,
2021. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees. 

Loss
from Continuing Operations 

Loss
from continuing operations was 46,344 during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 42,314 during the year ended December
31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Recent
Developments 

None. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had minimal cash. 

As
disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on October 5, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement SPA with Eastone Equities, LLC Eastone and certain selling stockholders listed on Exhibit A to that agreement, pursuant to
which the selling shareholders transferred to Eastone 44,566,412 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock for a purchase price
of 295,000. The transaction contemplated in the SPA closed on October 9, 2017 (the Closing and resulted in a change of
control. 

Simultaneously
with the Closing, Mr. Wayne Tsao was appointed as the Company s then Chief Executive Officer, President and the Chairman of the
Board, and Ms. Charlene Cheng was appointed as the then Chief Financial Officer and a director of the Board, effective as of October
23, 2017. 

As
a result of the change of control of the Company, the Company and its new management team is focusing on seeking to acquire an operating
business with strong growth potential. 

The
value of the Company is now dependent upon management s ability to locate and consummate the acquisition of an operating business
with strong growth potential. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have minimal cash. However, prior to completing
an acquisition, our expenses will consist primarily of compliance costs associated with being a public company, and we expect these compliance
costs to be substantially less than they have been historically, at least until we complete an acquisition transaction. 

If
we need to raise additional funds, we intend to do so through equity and/or debt financing. 

7 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company incurred losses from continuing operations of 46,344 and 42,314 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,
and has an accumulated deficit of 1,315,297, and working capital deficit of 250,473 as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company
had no net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds
will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital
resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company
to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there
can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant
dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders.

ITEM
9A: Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in rules and forms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the president and secretary, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our president and controller, we evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon
that evaluation, our president and treasurer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective, based on having insufficient resources to establish an effective control and procedures environment
during 2022. Although we do have a subcontracted outside accountant, there is not enough personnel to establish proper controls and procedures
with checks and balances at this time.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our
President evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment,
our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our President concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our
internal control over financial reporting were not effective, based on having insufficient resources to establish an effective control
environment during 2022. 

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Security and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this
Annual Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the year covered by this report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Except
as disclosed herein, we are not a party to any pending legal proceeding. To the knowledge of our management, except as disclosed herein,
no federal, state or local governmental agency is presently contemplating any proceeding against us. 

On
or about August 12, 2014, we received a Notice of Debarment from the US Defense Logistics Agency DLA (the Notice ).
The Notice (i) prevents us from bidding on new government contracts and (ii) precludes the renewal of any existing contract that is otherwise
renewable. The Notice was issued to us because our then CEO (who was also a significant shareholder of our company) is affiliated with
a company that is alleged to have sold products to the DLA that did not conform to the applicable contract. The DLA has not alleged any
wrongdoing whatsoever with respect to our company or its contracts with the DLA. 

On
November 3, 2014, the Company filed a letter with DLA opposing the proposed notice of debarment based on the alleged affiliation with
the other company. 

11 

We
have since received notification from the DLA stating that our appeal was reviewed and denied. As a result, we are not able to bid on
any new US government contracts that might otherwise be of interest to us. Currently, we do not plan to bid on any new US government
contracts. 

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

The
common stock of the Company is registered under the Exchange Act, and therefore, the officers, directors and holders of more than 10 
of our outstanding shares are subject to the provisions of Section 16(a) which requires them to file with the SEC initial reports of
ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and our other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than 10 
beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely upon
review of the copies of such forms furnished to us during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there were no untimely filings of
Section 16(a) reports. 

Board
Committees 

The
Company currently has not established any committees of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may designate from among its members
an executive committee and one or more other committees in the future. We do not have a nominating committee or a nominating committee
charter. Further, we do not have a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders.
To date, other than as described above, no security holders have made any such recommendations. The entire Board of Directors performs
all functions that would otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present size of our board, it is not practical for us to have
committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations, we intend to expand the size of our board and allocate responsibilities
accordingly. 

Code
of Ethics 

As
of yet, we have not adopted a corporate code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. 

Nominating
Committee 

We
have not established a Nominating Committee because, given that we presently have only one director and one executive officer, we believe
that we are able to effectively manage the issues normally considered by a Nominating Committee. 

If
we do establish a Nominating Committee, we will disclose this change to our procedures in recommending nominees to our Board. 

Audit
Committee 

We
have not established an Audit Committee because, given that we presently have only one director and one executive officer, we believe
that we are able to effectively manage the issues normally considered by an Audit Committee. 

ITEM
11: Executive Compensation 

No
current or prior officer or director has received any remuneration or compensation from the Company in the past fiscal year, nor has
any member of the Company s management been granted any option or stock appreciation right. Accordingly, no tables relating to
such items have been included within this Item 11. None of our employees is subject to a written employment agreement nor has any officer
received a cash salary since our founding. The Company has no agreement or understanding, express or implied, with any director, officer
or principal stockholder, or their affiliates or associates, regarding compensation in the form of salary, bonuses, stocks, options,
warrants or any other form of remuneration, for services performed on behalf of the Company. Nor are there compensatory plans or arrangements,
including payments to any officer in relation to resignation, retirement, or other termination of employment, or any change in control
of the Company, or a change in the officer s responsibilities following a change in control of the Company.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To:
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

UNIVERSAL
GLOBAL HUB INC. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of UNIVERSAL GLOBAL HUB INC. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the
period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had
incurred substantial losses during the year, and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management s plan in regards to these matters are described in Note 2. These financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Related party transactions 

As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements,
the Company relied on its controlling shareholder to pay expenses on its behalf so that the Company was able to meet its reporting obligations
as a public company. Evaluating the completeness, existence, valuation and allocation, and the presentation and disclosure of the due
to related parties and general and administrative expense accounts required the engagement team to exercise subjective and complex judgments. 

In order to address this critical audit matter,
the engagement team performed the procedures below and evaluated the audit evidence to form its our overall opinion on the financial statements
taken as a whole. 

Sent confirmations to vendors and to related
parties to confirm the completeness and valuation of balances; 

Vouched and traced invoices and payment records to confirm the existence and occurrence of transactions; 

Inquired with Company personnel regarding their knowledge of all known related parties and transactions with those related parties, and procured detailed schedules to supporting the valuation and allocation, and presentation and disclosure of such transactions and balances.
