Certain statements herein, including without limitation, certain matters discussed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of
 this Form 10 K, are forward looking statements, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that reflect our current views
 with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements typically include the words expect, estimate, project, budget, forecast, anticipate, intend, plan, may, will, could, should, believes, 
 predicts, potential, continue, poised, optimistic, prospects, ability, looking, forward, invest, grow, improve, deliver and similar expressions, but the absence of such words or expressions does not mean a statement is not
 forward-looking. These forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified below, which could cause actual future results to differ materially from historical results or from those anticipated or implied by
 such statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of their dates or, if no date is provided, then as of the date of this Form 10 K. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
 forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law.

The following factors, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or from those indicated by forward looking statements included in this Form 10 K: (1) the
 level of demand for mortgage and commercial loans, which is affected by such external factors as general economic conditions, market interest rate levels, tax laws and the demographics of our lending markets; (2) the direction and magnitude of
 changes in interest rates and the relationship between market interest rates and the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities; (3) the rate and amount of loan losses incurred and projected to be incurred
 by us, increases in the amounts of our nonperforming assets, the level of our loss reserves and management s judgments regarding the collectability of loans; (4) changes in the regulation of lending and deposit operations or other regulatory
 actions, whether industry-wide or focused on our operations, including increases in capital requirements or directives to increase loan loss allowances or make other changes in our business operations; (5) legislative or regulatory changes,
 including those that may be implemented by the current Administration in Washington, D.C. and the Federal Reserve Board; (6) possible adverse rulings, judgments, settlements and other outcomes of litigation; (7) problems that may arise in
 integrating the businesses of our pre-merger companies, which may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected, or that we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of our pre-merger
 companies; (8) actions undertaken by both current and potential new competitors; (9) the possibility of adverse trends in property values or economic trends in the residential and commercial real estate markets in which we compete; (10) the effect
 of changes in economic conditions; (11) the effect of geopolitical uncertainties; (12) an inability to obtain and retain sufficient operating cash at our holding company; (13) the discontinuation of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark; (14) the
 impact of COVID-19 or other health crises on our future financial condition and operations; (15) the impact of recent volatility in the banking sector due to the failure of certain banks due to high levels of exposure to liquidity risk, interest
 rate risk, uninsured deposits and cryptocurrency risk; (16) other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10 K, including those described in part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

General

Broadway Financial Corporation (the Company was incorporated under Delaware law in 1995 for the purpose of acquiring and holding all of the
 outstanding capital stock of Broadway Federal Savings and Loan Association as part of the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings association to a
 federally chartered stock savings bank. In connection with the conversion, the bank s name was changed to Broadway Federal Bank, f.s.b. Broadway Federal ). The conversion was completed, and the Broadway Federal became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in
 January 1996.

On April 1, 2021, the Company completed its merger (the Merger with CFBanc Corporation CFBanc ), with the Company continuing as the surviving
 entity. Immediately following the Merger, Broadway Federal merged with and into City First Bank of D.C, National Association with City First Bank of D.C., National Association continuing as the surviving entity (combined with Broadway Federal,
 City First or the Bank ). Concurrently with the Merger, the Bank changed its name to City First Bank, National Association.

Concurrently with the completion of the Merger, the Company converted to become a public benefit corporation. The Company works to spur equitable economic development with a mission to strengthen the
 overall well-being of historically excluded communities and has deployed loans and investments in the communities we serve that we believe has helped close funding gaps, preserved or increased access to affordable housing, created and preserved
 jobs, and expanded critical social services. We believe our status as a Delaware public benefit corporation aligns our business model of creating social, economic, and environmental value for underserved communities with a stakeholder governance
 model that allows us to give careful consideration to the impact of our decisions on workers, customers, suppliers, community, the environment, and our impact on society; and to align further our mission and values to our organizational documents.

On June 7, 2022, the Company closed a private placement (the Private Placement of shares of the Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual
 Preferred Stock, Series C, par value 0.01 (the Series C Preferred Stock ), pursuant to a Letter Agreement (collectively with the annexes, exhibits and schedules thereto, including the Securities Purchase Agreement - Standard Terms, the
 Purchase Agreement ), dated as of June 7, 2022, with the United States Department of the Treasury (the Purchaser ). The Purchase Agreement was entered into pursuant to the Purchaser s Emergency Capital Investment Program.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser acquired an aggregate of 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase
 price equal to 150.0 million in cash. The liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock is 1,000 per share.

In June 2022, the Company down streamed 75.0 million of the proceeds from the Private Placement to the Bank to enhance capital of the Company. As a result of the
 downstream, the Bank s tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 15.75 as of December 31, 2022 from 9.32 as of December 31, 2021.

The Company is currently regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ). The Bank is currently regulated by the Office
 of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ). The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta
 (the FHLB ). See Regulation for further descriptions of the regulatory systems to which the Company and the Bank are subject.

Available Information

Our internet website address is www.cityfirstbank.com. Our annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K and all amendments to those reports are available on
 our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and can be obtained free of charge by sending a written request to Broadway Financial
 Corporation, 4601 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 150, Los Angeles, California 90010 Attention: Audrey Phillips.

Business Overview

The Company is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and our principal business is the operation of our wholly owned subsidiary, City First, which has three offices: two in California (in Los
 Angeles and the nearby city of Inglewood) and one in Washington, D.C. City First s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding our branch offices, loan customers, large non-profit entities,
 local municipalities, and depositors who believe in the Bank s mission-driven focus. These deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in mortgage loans secured by residential properties with five or more units
 multi family and commercial real estate. Our assets also include mortgage loans secured by residential properties with one to four units single family as well as loans secured by commercial business assets. In addition, we invest in
 securities issued by federal government agencies, residential mortgage backed securities and other investments.

Our revenue is derived primarily from interest income on loans and investments. Our principal costs are interest expenses that we incur on deposits and borrowings, together with general and
 administrative expenses. Our earnings are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly monetary trends, and conditions, including changes in market interest rates and the differences in market interest rates
 for the interest-bearing deposits and borrowings that are our principal funding sources and the interest yielding assets in which we invest, as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.

Current Operating Environment

The Federal Reserve increased short - term

interest rates seven times during 2022 by 4.25 to curb inflation. The Bank s loan portfolio remained flat during the first half of the year but increased by 18.7 during the
 second half of the year as borrowers adjusted to higher interest rates.

Early in 2022, the Bank s management invested excess cash into short - term U.S. Treasury and
 agency securities and mortgage-backed securities to earn higher yields. In addition, the 150.0 million in Emergency Capital Investment Program ECIP proceeds received upon the sale of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury were primarily invested in two- to three -year U.S. Treasuries during June and July. These activities led to a decrease in the duration of the securities portfolio to 3.2 years as of December 31, 2022 from 4.4 years as of December 31, 2021 and an increase in the yield on interest earning assets to 3.36 
 during 2022 from 2.86 in 2021. The Company s cost of funds decreased to 0.40 during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 0.47 for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the cost of borrowings which resulted from
 payoffs and maturities of higher rate advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco in January and February of 2022, slightly offset by higher borrowing costs at the end of the year. There is no dividend requirement on the preferred
 stock issued to the U.S. Treasury until June of 2024.

In November of 2022, the Bank began borrowing from the FHLB to compensate for customer withdrawals to meet their year end cash flow needs . FHLB advances increased by 95.5 million during November of 2022 at an average rate of 4.08 , and remained at the same level during December of 2022 at an average rate of 4.58 . At December 31, 2022 and as of the date of this report , the Bank had additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB and sufficient collateral to meet its
 liquidity needs.

Overall, the Company s net interest margin increased to 3.05 during 2022 compared to 2.42 during 2021.

As of December 31, 2022, there were no loans greater than 30 days delinquent and only 144 thousand in non-performing loans. However, due to general concerns of a recession in the near future, the Bank continues to heavily monitor its loan portfolio for credit concerns.

As of December 31, 2022, Broadway Financial Corporation had 75 million in available capital to support the Bank and for general corporate purposes.

Industry Update

The failure of three regional banks in March of 2023 and the resultant negative outlook on the banking sector has called into question the exposure of banks to crypto risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and the
 exposure of banks to unrecognized investment losses due to investments classified as held to maturity on the balance sheet. Also, analysts have been monitoring the level of uninsured deposits in banks due to the liquidity risk associate with high
 levels of uninsured deposits.

City First Bank has no crypto risk exposure and all of our investments are available- for - sale and marked to market on a monthly basis. As of March 23, 2023, the Bank had 150 million in borrowing
 capacity with the FHLB based on pledged loan collateral and 228 million in additional borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank based on unpledged securities.

The Bank s interest rate risk has increased over the last year due to the increasing rate environment but remains moderate. Our percentage of uninsured deposits was 31 as of December 31, 2022.

Lending Activities

General

Our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage loans which are secured by multi family residential properties, single family residential properties and commercial real estate, including charter
 schools, community facilities, and churches. The remainder of the loan portfolio consists of commercial business loans, loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (the SBA and construction-to-permanent loans. At December 31, 2022, our
 net loan portfolio totaled 768.0 million, or 64.9 of total assets.

Table of Contents 

We emphasize the origination of adjustable rate loans, most of which are hybrid loans (loans having an initial fixed rate period which are initially 5 years, followed by an adjustable rate period),
 for our portfolio of loans held for investment. We originate these loans in order to maintain a high percentage of loans that have provisions for periodic repricing, thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2022, more
 than 79 of our loans had adjustable rate features. However, most of our adjustable rate loans behave like fixed rate loans for periods of time because the loans may still be in their initial fixed rate period or may be subject to interest rate
 floors.

The types of loans that we originate are subject to federal laws and regulations. The interest rates that we charge on loans are affected by the
 demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are in turn affected by, among other things, economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including
 the FRB, and legislative tax policies. See Regulation for more information on the government regulations to which we are subject.

Multi Family and Commercial Real Estate Lending

Our primary lending emphasis has been on the origination of loans for apartment
 buildings with five or more units. These multi family loans amounted to 502.1 million and 393.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Multi family loans represented 65.08 of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2022
 compared to 60.36 of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. The vast majority of our multi family loans amortize over 30 years. As of December 31, 2022, our single largest multi family credit had an outstanding balance of 11.8
 million, was current, and was collateralized by a 53-unit apartment complex in Downey, California .
 At December 31, 2022, the average balance of a loan in our multi family portfolio was 1.3 million. 

Our commercial real estate loans amounted to 114.6 million and 93.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Commercial real estate loans represented 14.85 and 14.29 of our gross loan
 portfolios at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Most commercial real estate loans are originated with principal repayments on a 25- to 30-year amortization schedule but are due in 5 years or 10 years. As of December 31, 2022, our single
 largest commercial real estate credit had an outstanding principal balance of 15.7 million, was current, and was a bridge loan collateralized by a 72-unit apartment complex located in Washington, D.C. At December 31, 2022, the average balance of a
 loan in our commercial real estate portfolio was 1.2 million.

The interest rates on multi family and commercial adjustable-rate mortgage loans ARM

Loans are based on a variety of indices, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), the 1 Year Constant Maturity Treasury Index 1 Yr CMT ), the 12 Month
 Treasury Average Index 12 MTA ), the 11th District Cost of Funds Index COFI ), and the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate Prime Rate ). All loans previously indexed to LIBOR were converted to SOFR as of December 31, 2022. We currently offer
 adjustable rate loans with interest rates that adjust either semi annually or semi annually upon expiration of an initial three or five year fixed rate period. Borrowers are required to make monthly payments under the terms of such loans.

Loans secured by multi family and commercial properties are granted based on the income producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower. The primary factors considered
 include, among other things, the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to required principal and interest payments, or debt service),
 and the ratio of the loan amount to the lower of the purchase price or the appraised value of the collateral.

We seek to mitigate the risks associated with multi family and commercial real estate loans by applying appropriate underwriting requirements, which include limitations on loan to value ratios and
 debt service coverage ratios. Under our underwriting policies, loan to value ratios on our multi family and commercial real estate loans usually do not exceed 75 of the lower of the purchase price or the appraised value of the underlying property.
 We also generally require minimum debt service coverage ratios of 120 for multi family loans and commercial real estate loans. Properties securing multi family and commercial real estate loans are appraised by management approved independent
 appraisers. Title insurance is required on all loans.

Multi family and commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as exposing the lender to a greater risk of loss than single family residential loans and typically involve higher loan principal
 amounts than loans secured by single family residential real estate. Because payments on loans secured by multi family and commercial real properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such
 loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or general economy. Adverse economic conditions in our primary lending market area could result in reduced cash flows on multi family and commercial real estate loans, vacancies
 and reduced rental rates on such properties. We seek to reduce these risks by originating such loans on a selective basis and generally restrict such loans to our general market area. In 2008, Broadway Federal ceased out of state lending for all
 types of loans. As a result of the Merger, in 2021 we resumed out-of-state lending on a selective basis, however we currently do not have any loans outstanding that are outside of our market area, which consists of Southern California and the
 Washington, D.C. area (including parts of Maryland and Virginia).

Our church loans totaled 15.8 million and 22.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented 2.04 and 3.45 of our gross
 loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Broadway Federal ceased originating church loans in 2010 in Southern California, however City First originates loans to churches in the Washington , D.C. area as part of its community development mission. As of December 31, 2022 , our single largest church loan had an outstanding balance of 2.3 million, was current, and was collateralized by a church building and parcel of land in Baltimore, Maryland. At December 31, 2022 , the averag e balance of a loan in our church loan portfolio was 610 thousand.

Single Family Mortgage Lending

While we have historically been primarily a multi family and commercial real estate lender, we also have purchased or originated loans secured by single family residential properties, including
 investor owned properties, with maturities of up to 30 years. Single family loans totaled 30.0 million and 45.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the single family residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2022,
 more than 22 had adjustable rate features. We did not purchase any single family loans during 2022 and 2021. Of the 30.0 million of single family loans at December 31, 2022, 19.5 million are secured by investor owned properties.

The interest rates for our single family ARM Loans are indexed to COFI, SOFR, 12 MTA and 1 Yr. CMT. All loans previously indexed to LIBOR were converted to SOFR as of December 31, 2022. We currently
 offer loans with interest rates that adjust either semi annually or semi annually upon expiration of an initial three or five year fixed rate period. Borrowers are required to make monthly payments under the terms of such loans. Most of our single
 family adjustable rate loans behave like fixed rate loans because the loans are still in their initial fixed rate period or are subject to interest rate floors.

We qualify our ARM Loan borrowers based upon the fully indexed interest rate (SOFR or other index plus an applicable margin) provided by the terms of the loan. However, we may discount the initial
 rate paid by the borrower to adjust for market and other competitive factors. The ARM Loans that we offer have a lifetime adjustment limit that is set at the time that the loan is approved. In addition, because of interest rate caps and floors,
 market rates may exceed or go below the respective maximum or minimum rates payable on our ARM Loans.

The mortgage loans that we originate generally include due on sale clauses, which provide us with the contractual right to declare the loan immediately due and payable if the borrower transfers
 ownership of the property.

Construction Lending

The Merger added a construction lending program and portfolio to our existing lending operations and platform. Construction loans totaled 40.7 million and 32.1 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
 respectively, and represented 5.27 and 4.92 of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We acquired 19.8 million of construction loans in the Merger. We provide loans for the construction of single family, multi family and
 commercial real estate projects and for land development. We generally make construction and land loans at variable interest rates based upon the Prime Rate, or the applicable Treasury Index plus a margin. Generally, we require a loan to value
 ratio not exceeding 75 and a loan to cost ratio not exceeding 85 on construction loans.

Construction loans involve risks that are different from those for completed project lending because we advance loan funds based upon the security and estimated value at completion of the project
 under construction. If the borrower defaults on the loan, we may have to advance additional funds to finance the project s completion before the project can be sold. Moreover, construction projects are affected by uncertainties inherent in
 estimating construction costs, potential delays in construction schedules due to supply chain or other issues, market demand and the accuracy of estimates of the value of the completed project considered in the loan approval process. In addition,
 construction projects can be risky as they transition to completion and lease up. Tenants who may have been interested in leasing a unit or apartment may not be able to afford the space when the building is completed, or may fail to lease the space
 for other reasons such as more attractive terms offered by competing lessors, making it difficult for the building to generate enough cash flow for the owner to obtain permanent financing. We specialize in the origination of construction loans for
 affordable housing developments where rents are subsidized by housing authority agencies. During 2022, we originated 29.6 million of construction loans, compared to 24.9 million of construction loan originations during 2021.

Commercial Lending

Our commercial lending portfolio consists of loans and lending activities to businesses in our market area that are secured by business assets including inventory, receivables, machinery, and
 equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-real estate commercial loans totaled 64.8 million and 46.5 million, respectively. Commercial loans represented 8.40 of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31,
 2022, we originated 26.9 million of commercial loans. As of December 31, 2022, our single largest commercial loan had an outstanding balance of 10.0 million. At December 31, 2022, the average balance of a loan in our non-real estate commercial
 loan portfolio was 1.2 million.

The risks related to commercial loans differ from loans secured by real estate, and relate to the ability of borrowers to successfully operate their businesses and the difference between expected and
 actual cash flows of the borrowers. In addition, the recoverability of our investment in these loans is also dependent on other factors primarily dictated by the type of collateral securing these loans. The fair value of the collateral securing
 these loans may fluctuate as market conditions change. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the recovery of our investment is dependent upon the borrower s ability to collect amounts due from customers.

SBA Guaranteed Loans

City First is an approved SBA lender. We originate loans in the Washington, D.C ,
 Maryland, and Virginia under the SBA s 7(a), SBA Express, International Trade and 504(a) loan programs, in conformity with SBA underwriting and documentation standards. SBA loans are similar to commercial business loans but have additional credit
 enhancement provided by the U.S Federal Government with guarantees between 50-85 . Certain loans classified as SBA are secured by commercial real estate property. All other SBA loans are secured by business assets. As of December 31, 2022 and
 2021, SBA loans totaled 3.6 million and 18.8 million, respectively. Our December 31, 2022 SBA loans included 2.7 million of loans issued under the Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans. PPP loans have terms of two to five years and earn
 interest at 1 . PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and have virtually no risk of loss. The Bank expects the vast majority of the PPP loans to be fully forgiven by the SBA. SBA loans totaled 0.47 of our total loan portfolio as of December
 31, 2022.

Loan originations are derived from various sources including our loan personnel, local mortgage brokers, and referrals from customers. More than 90 of multi-family loan originations during 2022, 2021
 and 2020 were sourced from wholesale loan brokers. All commercial real estate loans, construction loans, commercial loans and SBA loans were derived from our loan personnel. No single family or consumer loans were originated during the last three
 years. For all loans that we originate, upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report is ordered, and certain other information is verified by an independent credit agency. If necessary, additional financial
 information is requested. An appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is required to be performed by an independent licensed or certified appraiser designated and approved by us. The Bank s Board of Directors (the Board annually reviews our appraisal policy. Management reviews annually the qualifications and performance of independent appraisers that we use.

It is our policy to obtain title insurance on collateral for all real estate loans. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance naming the Bank as a loss payee prior to loan closing. If the original
 loan amount exceeds 80 on a sale or refinance of a first trust deed loan, we may require private mortgage insurance and the borrower is required to make payments to a mortgage impound account from which we make disbursements to pay private
 mortgage insurance premiums, property taxes and hazard and flood insurance as required.

Each loan requires at least two signatures for approval. The Board has authorized loan approval limits for various management team members up to 7
 million per individual, and up to 12 million for the Chief Executive. Loans in excess of 7 million require review and approval by members of the Board s Loan Committee. In
 addition, it is our practice that all loans approved be reported to the Loan Committee no later than the month following their approval and be ratified by the Board.

From time to time, we purchase loans originated by other institutions based upon our investment needs and market opportunities. The determination to purchase specific loans or pools of loans is
 subject to our underwriting policies, which consider, among other factors, the financial condition of the borrowers, the location of the underlying collateral properties and the appraised value of the collateral properties. We did not purchase any
 loans during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.

During 2022 and 2021, we did not originate or sell any loans that were classified as held for sale. During 2020, we originated 118.6 million of multi family loans for sale, sold 104.3 million of
 multi family loans and transferred 13.7 million of multi-family loans to held for investment from loans held for sale. We transferred the 13.7 million of multi-family loans to loans held for investment near the end of 2020 because there was room
 to do so within the regulatory loan concentration guidelines. Loans are generally sold with the servicing released.

Certain multi-family loans have adjustable rate features based on SOFR, but are fixed for the first five years. Our experience has shown that these
 loans typically pay off during the first five years and do not reach the adjustable rate phase. Multi-family loans in their initial fixed rate period totaled 446.6 million or 58 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022.

Asset Quality

General

The underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower s ability to continue to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to continue to
 do so, the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. A borrower s ability to pay, in the case of single family residential loans and consumer loans, typically is dependent primarily on employment and other sources of income. Multi family
 and commercial real estate loan borrowers ability to pay is typically dependent on the cash flow generated by the property, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions. Commercial business and SBA loan borrowers ability to pay is
 typically dependent on the successful operation of their businesses or their ability to collect amounts due from their customers. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets, may also impact a borrower s
 ability to make loan payments. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, are also impacted by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, demographics, property maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays.

Delinquencies

We perform a weekly review of all delinquent loans and a monthly loan delinquency report is made to the Internal Asset Review Committee of the Board of Directors. When a borrower fails to make a
 required payment on a loan, we take several steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. The procedures we follow with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the type of loan, the type of property
 securing the loan, and the period of delinquency. In the case of residential mortgage loans, we generally send the borrower a written notice of non payment promptly after the loan becomes past due. In the event payment is not received promptly
 thereafter, additional letters are sent, and telephone calls are made. If the loan is still not brought current and it becomes necessary for us to take legal action, we generally commence foreclosure proceedings on all real property securing the
 loan. In the case of commercial real estate loans, we generally contact the borrower by telephone and send a written notice of intent to foreclose upon expiration of the applicable grace period. Decisions not to commence foreclosure upon expiration
 of the notice of intent to foreclose for commercial real estate loans are made on a case by case basis. We may consider loan workout arrangements with commercial real estate borrowers in certain circumstances.

Non Performing Assets

Non performing assets NPAs include non accrual loans and real estate owned through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure REO ). NPAs at December 31, 2022 decreased to 144 thousand, or
 0.01 of total assets, from 684 thousand, or 0.06 of total assets, at December 31, 2021.

Non-accrual loans consist of delinquent loans that are 90 days or more past due and other loans, including troubled debt restructurings TDRs that do not qualify for accrual status. As of December
 31, 2022, all our non accrual loans were current in their payments, but were treated as non accrual primarily because of deficiencies in non payment matters related to the borrowers, such as lack of current financial information. The 540 thousand
 decrease in non accrual loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 was the result of the payoff of one non-accrual loan.

There were no accrual loans that were contractually past due by 90 days or more at December 31, 2022 or 2021. We had no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans were on
 non accrual status at December 31, 2022.

We discontinue accruing interest on loans when the loans become 90 days delinquent as to their payment due date three missed payments). In addition, we reverse all previously accrued and uncollected interest for those loans through a charge to interest income. While loans are in non accrual status, interest
 received on such loans is credited to principal, until the loans qualify for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are
 reasonably assured.

We may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan. In cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the
 modification is considered a TDR. Non accrual loans modified in a TDR remain on non accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, which requires that the borrower demonstrate performance
 according to the restructured terms, generally for a period of at least six months. Loans modified in a TDR that are included in non accrual loans totaled 144 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 684 thousand at December 31, 2021. Excluded from
 non accrual loans are restructured loans that were not delinquent at the time of modification or loans that have complied with the terms of their restructured agreement for six months or such longer period as management deems appropriate for
 particular loans, and therefore have been returned to accruing status. Restructured accruing loans totaled 1.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 1.6 million at December 31, 2021.

During 2022, gross interest income that would have been recorded on non accrual loans had they performed in accordance with their original terms, totaled 31 thousand. No income was recognized during
 2022 on non-accrual loans prior to payoff. Interest income of 102 thousand was recognized upon the payoff of one non-accrual church loan during 2022.

We update our estimates of collateral value on loans when they become 90 days past due and to the extent the loans remain delinquent, every nine months thereafter. We obtain updated estimates of
 collateral value earlier than at 90 days past due for loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy or for certain other loans when our Internal Asset Review Committee believes repayment of such loans may be dependent on the value of the
 underlying collateral. We also obtain updated collateral valuations for loans classified as substandard every year. For single family loans, updated estimates of collateral value are obtained through appraisals and automated valuation models. For
 multi family and commercial real estate properties, we estimate collateral value through appraisals or internal cash flow analyses when current financial information is available, coupled with, in most cases, an inspection of the property. For
 commercial loans, we estimate the value of the collateral based on financial information provided by borrowers or valuations of business assets, depending on the nature of the collateral. Our policy is to make a charge against our allowance for
 loan losses, and correspondingly reduce the book value of a loan, to the extent that the collateral value of the property securing an impaired loan is less than our recorded investment in the loan. See Allowance for Loan Losses for full
 discussion of the allowance for loan losses.

As a result of the Merger, we acquired certain loans that have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. These loans are referred to as
 purchased credit impaired loans . These PCI loans are recorded at their fair value at acquisition, and are not treated as nonaccrual loans for purposes of financial reporting. At
 acquisition we estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each PCI loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the allocated fair value is recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The
 excess of the loan s contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Expected cash flows continue to be estimated each quarter for each PCI loan. If the present value of expected cash flows
 decreases from the prior estimate, a provision for loan losses is recorded and an allowance for loan losses is established. If the present value of expected cash flows increases from the prior estimate, the increase is recognized as part of future
 interest income. At the date of the Merger, we recorded an investment in PCI loans of 883 thousand. As of December 31, 2022, our recorded investment in PCI loans was 125 thousand. These PCI loans are not classified as NPAs as they are performing
 in accordance with the cash flows that were expected at the date of the Merger.

Classification of Assets

Federal regulations and our internal policies require that we utilize an asset classification system as a means of monitoring and reporting problem
 and potential problem assets. We have incorporated asset classifications as a part of our credit monitoring system and thus classify potential problem assets as Watch and Special Mention, and problem assets as Substandard, Doubtful or
 Loss . An asset is considered Watch if the loan is current but temporarily presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention and monitoring. An
 asset is considered Special Mention if the loan is current but there are some potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and
 paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets
 classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and
 values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted.
 Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but that are considered to possess some weaknesses, are designated Special Mention. Our Internal Asset Review
 Department reviews and classifies our assets and independently reports the results of its reviews to the Internal Asset Review Committee of our Board of Directors monthly.

Criticized assets increased to 47.8 million at December 31, 2022, from 16.0 million at December 31, 2021. City First has historically classified all newly originated construction loans as Watch
 until a history of loan performance can be established or until the construction project is complete, which is the main reason for the increase in total criticized loans of 31.9 million during 2022. The decrease in substandard loans of 2.3
 million was due to the improvement of three church loans and one multi-family loan. The loans were current as of December 31, 2022.

Allowance for Loan Losses

In originating loans, we recognize that losses may be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss may vary as a result of many factors, including the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness
 of the borrower, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan. We are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses ALLL in accordance with U.S. Generally
 Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). The ALLL represents our management s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses in our loan portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Our ALLL is intended to cover specifically
 identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable, but not specifically identifiable. There can be no assurance, however, that actual losses incurred will not exceed the amount of
 management s estimates.

Our Internal Asset Review Department issues reports to the Board of Directors and continually reviews loan quality. This analysis includes a detailed review of the classification and categorization of
 problem loans, potential problem loans and loans to be charged off, an assessment of the overall quality and collectability of the portfolio, and concentration of credit risk. Management then evaluates the allowance, determines its appropriate
 level and the need for additional provisions, and presents its analysis to the Board of Directors which ultimately reviews management s recommendation and, if deemed appropriate, then approves such recommendation.

The ALLL is increased by provisions for loan losses which are charged to earnings and is decreased by recaptures of loan loss provision and charge offs, net of recoveries. Provisions are recorded to
 increase the ALLL to the level deemed appropriate by management. The Bank utilizes an allowance methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including the amount of non performing loans, our loan loss experience,
 conditions in the general real estate and housing markets, current economic conditions, and trends, particularly levels of unemployment, and changes in the size of the loan portfolio.

The ALLL consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired.

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according
 to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered TDRs and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in
 determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not
 classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the
 delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.

If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated to the loan so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at
 the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. TDRs are separately identified for impairment and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s effective rate at inception. If a
 TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. For TDRs that subsequently default, we determine the amount of any necessary additional charge off
 based on internal analyses and appraisals of the underlying collateral securing these loans. At December 31, 2022, impaired loans totaled 1.7 million and had an aggregate specific allowance allocation of 7 thousand.

The general component of the ALLL covers non impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. Each month, we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire
 loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (single family, multi family, commercial real estate, construction, commercial, SBA and consumer) and loan classification (pass, watch, special mention, substandard and doubtful).
 With the use of a migration to loss analysis, we calculate our historical loss rate and assign estimated loss factors to the loan classification categories based on our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are
 periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to our historical loss experience, levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans;
 effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and
 conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.

In addition to loss experience and environmental factors, we use qualitative analyses to determine the adequacy of our ALLL. This analysis includes ratio analysis to evaluate the overall measurement
 of the ALLL and comparison of peer group reserve percentages. The qualitative review is used to reassess the overall determination of the ALLL and to ensure that directional changes in the ALLL and the provision for loan losses are supported by
 relevant internal and external data.

Loans acquired in the Merger were recorded at fair value at acquisition date without a carryover of the related ALLL. Purchased credit impaired loans acquired are loans that have evidence of credit
 deterioration since origination and as to which it is probable at the date of acquisition that the Company will not collect all of principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms. These loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30.

Based on our evaluation of the housing and real estate markets and overall economy, including the unemployment rate, the levels and composition of our loan delinquencies and
 non performing loans, our loss history and the size and composition of our loan portfolio, we determined that an ALLL of 4.4 million, or 0.57 of loans held for investment, was appropriate at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.4 million, or 0.52 
 of loans held for investment at December 31, 2021. This increase was due to new loans originated at an average ALLL provision rate of 0.65 during 2022. The CFB loan portfolio as of the merger date was marked to market, so there is no
 ALLL associated with it.

A federally chartered bank s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the OCC. The OCC, in conjunction with the other
 federal banking agencies, provides guidance for financial institutions on the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate valuation allowances, as well as guidance for banking agency examiners to use in
 determining the adequacy of valuation allowances. It is required that all institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems, analyze all significant factors that affect the collectability of
 the portfolio in a reasonable manner and establish acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives of the guidelines issued by federal regulatory agencies. While we believe that the ALLL has been established and maintained at
 adequate levels, future adjustments may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ materially from the conditions on which we based our estimates at December 31, 2022. In addition, there can be no assurance that the OCC or other
 regulators, as a result of reviewing our loan portfolio and/or allowance, will not require us to materially increase our ALLL, thereby affecting our financial condition and earnings.

Investment Activities

The main objectives of our investment strategy are to provide a source of liquidity for deposit outflows, repayment of our borrowings and funding
 loan commitments, and to generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk. Subject to various restrictions, our investment policy generally permits investments in money market instruments such as
 Federal Funds Sold, certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, securities issued by federal and other government agencies and mortgage backed securities, mutual funds, municipal
 obligations, corporate bonds, and marketable equity securities. Mortgage backed securities consist principally of securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government
 National Mortgage Association which are backed by 30 year amortizing hybrid ARM Loans, structured with fixed interest rates for periods of three to seven years, after which time the loans convert to one year or six month adjustable rate mortgage
 loans. At December 31, 2022, our securities portfolio, consisting primarily of federal agency debt, mortgage backed securities, bonds issued by the United States Treasury and the SBA, and municipal bonds, totaled 328.7 million, o r 27.76 of t otal assets.

We classify investments as held to maturity or available for sale at the date of purchase based on our assessment of our internal liquidity
 requirements. Securities purchased to meet investment related objectives such as liquidity management or mitigating interest rate risk and which may be sold as necessary to implement management strategies, are designated as available for sale at
 the time of purchase. Securities in the held to maturity category consist of securities purchased for long term investment in order to enhance our ongoing stream of net interest income. Securities deemed held to maturity are classified as such
 because we have both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Held to maturity securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Available for sale securities are reported at fair
 value. We currently have no securities classified as held to maturity securities.

Sources of Funds

General

Deposits are our primary source of funds for supporting our lending and other investment activities and general business purposes. In addition to deposits, we obtain funds from the amortization and
 prepayment of loans and investment securities, sales of loans and investment securities, advances from the FHLB, and cash flows generated by operations.

Deposits

We offer a variety of deposit accounts featuring a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits principally consist of savings accounts, checking accounts, interest checking accounts, money market
 accounts, and fixed term certificates of deposit. The maturities of term certificates generally range from one month to five years. We accept deposits from customers within our market area based primarily on posted rates, but from time to time we
 will negotiate the rate based on the amount of the deposit. We primarily rely on customer service and long standing customer relationships to attract and retain deposits. We seek to maintain and increase our retail core deposit relationships,
 consisting of savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts because we believe these deposit accounts tend to be a stable funding source and are available at a lower cost than term deposits. However, market interest rates, including
 rates offered by competing financial institutions, the availability of other investment alternatives, and general economic conditions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits.

We participate in a deposit program called the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS ). CDARS is a deposit placement service that allows us to place our customers funds in
 FDIC insured certificates of deposit at other banks and, at the same time, receive an equal sum of funds from the customers of other banks in the CDARS Network CDARS Reciprocal ). These deposits totaled 74.6 million and 141.6 million at
 December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and are not considered to be brokered deposits.

We may also accept deposits from other institutions when we have no reciprocal deposit CDARS One Way Deposits ). With the CDARS One-Way Deposits program, the Bank accepts deposits from CDARS even
 though there is no customer account involved. These one-way deposits, which are considered to brokered deposits, totaled 0 and 223 thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had 4.3 million and 5.0 million in (non-CDARS) brokered deposits, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 212.9 million and 265.8 million of our total deposits were not insured by FDIC insurance.

Borrowings

We utilize short term and long term advances from the FHLB as an alternative to retail deposits as a funding source for asset growth. FHLB advances are generally secured by mortgage loans and
 mortgage backed securities. Such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions fluctuates from
 time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB. At December 31, 2022, we had 128.3 million in outstanding FHLB advances and had the ability to borrow up to an additional 70.6 million based on available and pledged collateral.

The following table summarizes information concerning our FHLB advances at or for the periods indicated:

The Bank enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Bank may transfer
 legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Bank to repurchase the assets. As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing
 agreements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Banks s consolidated statements of financial condition, while the
 securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. As of
 December 31, 2022, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 63.5 million at an average rate of 0.38 . These agreements mature on a daily basis. The market value of securities pledged totaled 64.4 million as of December 31, 2022
 and included 33.3 million of federal agency debt, 19.2 million of U.S. Treasuries and 11.9 million of federal agency mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2021, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 52.0 million at
 an average rate of 0.10 . The market value of securities pledged totaled 53.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and included 25.9 million of federal agency
 mortgage-backed securities, 13.3 million of federal agency debt, 9.8 million of SBA pool, and 4.2 million of federal
 agency CMO.

 connection with the New Market Tax Credit activities of the Bank, CFC 45 is a partnership whose members include CFNMA and City First New Markets Fund II, LLC. In December 2015, a national brokerage firm made a 14.0 million non-recourse loan to CFC
 45, whereby CFC 45 was the beneficiary of the loan from the brokerage firm and passed the proceeds from that loan through to a Qualified Active Low-Income Community Business QALICB ). The loan to the QALICB is secured by a Leasehold Deed of Trust
 from which the funds for repayment of the loan will be derived. Debt service payments received by CFC 45 from the QALICB are passed through to the brokerage firm, less a servicing fee which is retained by CFC 45. The financial statements of CFC 45
 are consolidated with those of the Bank and the Company.

On March 17, 2004, we issued 6.0 million of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures in a private placement to a trust that was capitalized to purchase subordinated debt and
 preferred stock of multiple community banks. Interest on the Debentures is payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.54 . On October 16, 2014, we made payments of 900 thousand of principal on the Debentures, executed
 a Supplemental Indenture for the Debentures that extended the maturity of the Debentures to March 17, 2024, and modified the payment terms of the remaining 5.1 million principal amount thereof. The modified terms of the Debentures required
 quarterly payments of interest only through March 2019 at the original rate of 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.54 . Starting in June 2019, the Company was required to begin to make quarterly payments of equal amounts of principal, plus interest, until the
 Debentures are fully amortized on March 17, 2024. In September of 2021, we redeemed the remaining amounts outstanding under the Debentures for 3.3 million.

Market Area and Competition

The Bank is a Community Development Financial Institution CDFI and a certified B Corp, offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. Our retail banking
 network includes full service banking offices, automated teller machines and internet banking capabilities that are available using our website at www.ciytfirstbank.com. We have three banking offices as of December 31, 2022: two in California (in
 Los Angeles and in the nearby City of Inglewood) and one in Washington, D.C.

14 

Table of Contents 

Both the Washington , D.C. and the Los Angeles metropolitan areas are highly
 competitive banking markets for making loans and attracting deposits. Although our offices are primarily located in low to moderate income communities that have historically been under served by other financial institutions, we face significant
 competition for deposits and loans in our immediate market areas, including direct competition from mortgage banking companies, commercial banks and savings and loan associations. Most of these financial institutions are significantly larger than
 we are and have greater financial resources, and many have a regional, statewide, or national presence.

Human Capital Management

Human Capital

We are a unified, commercial CDFI with a focused vision, mission, and strategy that equitably drives economic, social, and environmental justice for
 our clients and communities in which we work making them better places to be. We believe that employees are one of our most important resources and in order to fulfill future and sustainable growth, our key objectives include attracting, selecting, retaining , and developing top talent in the marketplace that closely align our employees personal values with the
 organization s values. As such, our culture is defined by our Shared Values principles: Clients and Communities First We Think
 Big We Model Excellence and ONE City First . 

City First s Shared Values principles are derived from critical beliefs and
 ingrained principles that guide the organization s actions, behaviors, and culture towards our primary objectives. Our Shared Values mean that we stand for something in how we view each other, the world, and our place of service in it. With these
 values centered in all that we do, we work collaboratively with mission-aligned customers looking to make an impact in under-resourced communities through affordable housing, charter schools, community health centers, nonprofits, and small to
 medium-sized businesses. Our employees behave in a manner that is consistent with these beliefs.

While the Board of Directors oversees the strategic management of our human capital management, our internal Human Resources team drives the day-to-day management of our human capital operations and
 strategy.

As of December 31, 2022, we employed 83 full-time and one part-time employee.
 Our employees are primarily located in Los Angeles, California and Washington, D.C. in our corporate offices, branches, and operating facilities. We also employ several remote workers who are in various locations throughout the U.S .

Compensation and Benefits

Our market competitive total employee compensation (salaries, bonuses and all benefits and rewards) is a critical tool enabling us to attract and retain talented people. In addition to base
 compensation, these programs include commission-based incentives, corporate incentive compensation plans, restricted stock awards, a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution, an employee stock ownership plan, healthcare, and insurance
 benefits including telehealth connection services, health savings accounts, employee assistance program, will prep services, college tuition benefit programs, and vacation/sick/family leave.

Our methodology is to provide pay levels and pay opportunities that are internally fair, cost-effective, and externally competitive to market-based
 salaries. To determine competitive market compensation levels, we use market surveys and economic research to benchmark our positions utilizing salary and compensation data of companies with similar positions, asset size and geographical
 locations. We annually review our salary structures and grade ranges to keep pace with changes in the marketplace. With the support of third-party experts in this field and within the banking industry, we conduct regular job evaluations to meet
 changing business needs or when the scope of existing positions or organizational changes occur. Our standard pay practices are designed to ensure that we honor and adhere to
 pay equity analysis.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Our legacy and history matter at City First. We are proud of our expanded 75-year history with the merger with Broadway Federal. Our founders in Los
 Angeles and Washington, D.C. were local leaders who saw a need in the community for a bank that addressed the lack of access to capital for historically excluded and disinvested
 urban majority minority communities.

Our Merger formed one of the largest Black-led Minority Depository Institutions MDI in the nation in the midst of a national reawakening to the systemic racial and economic disparities persisting and growing in our society. The Merger maintains the legacy of the
 constituent and honors the legacy of African American-led MDI s across the country that were founded to address the unmet financing needs of the community. Our intent, purpose, and execution are grounded in our 75-year history of deep commitment to
 economic justice through the targeted provision of capital for historically excluded and disinvested urban majority minority communities.

Table of Contents 

Our ownership, responsibility, and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is reflected in the composition of our workforce, executive leadership team, and board of directors. As of December
 31, 2022, more than 80 of the Company s employees self-identified as minority, approximately 64 of our employees were women, and other diverse groups such as veterans and people with disabilities were also represented.

Workforce Training and Development

We align our talent strategy with our business strategy to provide guidance on the proper mix of skills, emerging talent and business needs or issues. This investment to allow employees to learn,
 grow, and be fulfilled in their work stems from our development of providing a multi-dimensional approach to curriculum design and competency-based learning centered around culture and technical skills. Learning and development play a critical and
 strategic role as we prepare our organization for the future by recognizing continuous needs to upskill or reskill in order to scale our business.

Our employees receive continuing education courses relevant to their respective roles within the organization, as well as access to on-demand
 learning solutions to enhance leadership capabilities, advance communications skills and techniques, college credit courses, seminars, and training deeply embedded in cultural dynamics and awareness. To support employees who wish to continue
 their development and education, we provide reimbursement to employees who seek development to upskill or reskill while employed at the company. 

Regulation

General

City First and Broadway Financial Corporation are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by several different federal agencies. City
 First is regulated by the OCC as its primary federal regulator. The Bank s deposits generally are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 per account; the Bank also is regulated by the FDIC as its deposit insurer. The Bank is a member of the
 Federal Reserve System and is subject to certain regulations of the FRB, including, for example, regulations concerning reserves required to be maintained against deposits and regulations governing transactions with affiliates, Broadway
 Financial Corporation is regulated, examined, and supervised by the FRB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond FRBR and is also required to file certain reports and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC under the
 federal securities laws. The Bank also is subject to consumer protection regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ).

The OCC regulates and examines the Bank s business activities, including, among other things, capital standards, investment authority and permissible activities, deposit taking and borrowing
 authority, mergers and other business combination transactions, establishment of branch offices, and the structure and permissible activities of any subsidiaries of the Bank. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over national banks and
 has substantial discretion to impose enforcement actions on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including capital requirements, or that engages in practices that examiners determine to be unsafe or unsound.
 In addition, the FDIC has back-up enforcement authority that enables it to recommend enforcement action to the OCC with respect to a national bank and, if the recommended action is not taken by the OCC, to take such action under certain
 circumstances. In certain cases, the OCC has the authority to refer matters relating to federal fair lending laws to the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD if the OCC determines
 violations of the fair lending laws may have occurred.

Changes in applicable laws or the regulations of the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB, the CFPB, or other regulatory authorities, or changes in interpretations of such regulations or in agency policies or
 priorities, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and our Company, our operations, and the value of our debt and equity securities. We and our stock are also subject to rules issued by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), the stock
 exchange on which our voting common stock is traded. Failure to conform to Nasdaq s rules could have an adverse impact on us and the value of our equity securities.

The following paragraphs summarize certain laws and regulations that apply to the Company and the Bank. These descriptions of statutes and regulations and their possible effects do not purport to be
 complete descriptions of all the provisions of those statutes and regulations and their possible effects on us, nor do they purport to identify every statute and regulation that applies to us. In addition, the statutes and regulations that apply to
 the Company and the Bank are subject to change, which can affect the scope and cost of their compliance obligations.

Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

In July 2010, the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd Frank Act is intended to address perceived weaknesses in the U.S.
 financial regulatory system and prevent future economic and financial crises.

16 

Table of Contents 

The Dodd Frank Act established increased compliance obligations across a number of areas in the banking business. In particular, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies
 (comprising the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC) substantially revised their consolidated and bank-level risk based and leverage capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies and certain
 non bank financial companies. Under an existing FRB policy statement, bank holding companies with less than 3 billion in total consolidated assets are not subject to consolidated capital requirements provided they satisfy the conditions in the
 policy statement. The Dodd Frank Act requires bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary of the holding company that is a depository institution by providing financial assistance in the event of the
 financial distress of the depository institution.

The Dodd Frank Act also established the CFPB. The CFPB has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to banks and savings institutions of all sizes, including
 the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. At times during the past several years, the CFPB has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and nonbank financial institutions to enforce federal
 consumer financial laws and has developed a number of new enforcement theories and applications of these laws. The CFPB s supervisory authority does not generally extend to insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, that have less than 10
 billion in assets. The federal banking agencies, however, have authority to examine for compliance, and bring enforcement action for non-compliance, with respect to the CFPB s regulations. State attorneys general and state banking agencies and
 other state financial regulators also may have authority to enforce applicable consumer laws with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction.

Capital Requirements

The Bank s capital requirements are administered by the OCC and involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated in accordance with regulations
 promulgated by the OCC jointly with the FRB and the FDIC. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the OCC. Failure to meet capital requirements can result in supervisory or, potentially, enforcement action.

To implement the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies have developed a Community Bank
 Leverage Ratio CBLR (the ratio of a bank s tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in
 compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The federal banking agencies have set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio
 at 9 . The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act temporarily lowered this ratio to 8 as of 
 September 30, 2020. The ratio then rose to 8.5 at the end of 2021 and reestablished at 9 on January 1, 2022.

City First elected to adopt the CBLR option on April 1, 2020 as reflected in its September 30, 2020 Call Report. Its CBLR as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below.

At December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. In addition, the Bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for
 prompt corrective action. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred that would materially adversely change the Bank s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support the Bank s
 further growth and to maintain the well capitalized status.

Deposit Insurance

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks, including national banks, up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor. Pursuant to the Dodd Frank
 Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased to 250,000 per depositor, per ownership category.

17 

Table of Contents 

The FDIC charges an annual assessment for the insurance of deposits based on the risk a particular institution poses to the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). The Bank s DIF assessment is
 calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by the assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the Bank. The initial base assessment rate is based on an institution s capital
 level, and capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity CAMELS ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and in some
 cases, additional discretionary adjustments by the FDIC to reflect additional risk factors.

The FDIC s overall premium rate structure is subject to change from time to time to reflect its actual and anticipated loss experience. The financial crisis that began in 2008 resulted in
 substantially higher levels of bank failures than had occurred in the immediately preceding years. These failures dramatically increased the resolution costs incurred by the FDIC and substantially reduced the available amount of the DIF.

Consistent with the requirements of the Dodd Frank Act, the FDIC adopted its most recent DIF restoration plan in September 2020; that plan is designed to enable the FDIC to achieve the statutorily
 required reserve ratio of 1.35 by September 30, 2028. The FDIC Board has set the designated reserve ratio for each of the years 2021 and 2022 at 2 . The statute provides that in setting the amount of assessments necessary to meet the designated
 reserve ratio requirement, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of this provision on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion, so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio will be borne
 by institutions with more than 10 billion in assets. Accordingly, the FDIC has provided assessment credits to insured depository institutions, like the Bank, with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion for the portion of their regular
 assessments that contribute to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 and 1.35 . The FDIC has applied the credits each quarter that the reserve ratio was at least 1.38 to offset the regular deposit insurance assessments of institutions with
 credits. The Bank did not receive any assessment credits during 2022. During 2021, the Bank received two assessment credits totaling 49 thousand.

Although it rarely does so, the FDIC has the authority to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the
 institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of a bank s depositors.

Guidance on Commercial Real Estate Lending

In December 2015, the federal banking agencies released a statement titled Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending (the CRE Statement ). The CRE Statement expresses
 the banking agencies concerns with banking institutions that ease their commercial real estate underwriting standards, directs financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure
 and monitor lending risks, and indicates that the agencies will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The banking agencies previously issued guidance titled Prudent
 Commercial Real Estate Loan Workouts which provides guidance for financial institutions that are working with commercial real estate CRE borrowers who are experiencing diminished operating cash flows, depreciated collateral values, or
 prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties and details risk management practices for loan workouts that support prudent and pragmatic credit and business decision making within the framework of financial accuracy, transparency,
 and timely loss recognition. The banking agencies had also issued previous guidance titled Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate stating that a banking institution will be considered to be potentially exposed to
 significant CRE concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, if total CRE loans represent 300 or more of its total capital and the outstanding balance of the institution s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50 or
 more during the preceding 36 months.

In October 2009, the federal banking agencies adopted a policy statement supporting workouts of CRE loans, which is referred to as the CRE Policy
 Statement . The CRE Policy Statement provides guidance for examiners, and for financial institutions that are working with CRE borrowers who are experiencing diminished
 operating cash flows, depreciated collateral values, or prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties. The CRE Policy Statement details risk management practices for loan workouts that support prudent and pragmatic credit and
 business decision making within the framework of financial accuracy, transparency, and timely loss recognition. The CRE Policy Statement states that financial institutions that implement prudent loan workout arrangements after performing
 comprehensive reviews of the financial condition of borrowers will not be subject to criticism for engaging in these efforts, even if the restructured loans have weaknesses that result in adverse credit classifications. In addition, performing
 loans, including those renewed or restructured on reasonable modified terms, made to creditworthy borrowers, will not be subject to adverse classification solely because the value of the underlying collateral declined. The CRE Policy Statement
 reiterates existing guidance that examiners are expected to take a balanced approach in assessing an institution s risk management practices for loan workout activities.

In October 2018, the OCC provided Broadway Federal with a letter of no supervisory objection permitting it to increase the non multifamily commercial real estate loan concentration limit to 100 of
 Tier 1 Capital plus ALLL, including a sublimit of 50 for land/construction loans, which brought the total CRE loan concentration limit to 600 of Tier 1 Capital plus ALLL.

Loans to One Borrower

The Bank is in compliance with the statutory and regulatory limits applicable to loans to any one borrower. As of December 31, 2022, the lending limit for City First is 29.0 million. At December 31,
 2022, our largest loan to a single borrower was 15.7 million; that loan was performing in accordance with its terms and was otherwise in compliance with regulatory requirements.

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending

The Community Reinvestment Act, as implemented by OCC regulations CRA ), requires each national bank to make efforts to meet the credit needs of
 the communities it serves, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the OCC to assess an institution s performance in meeting the credit needs of its communities as part of its examination of the institution, and to take
 such assessments into consideration in reviewing applications for mergers, acquisitions, and other transactions. An unsatisfactory CRA rating may be the basis for denying an application. Community groups have successfully protested applications
 on CRA grounds. In connection with the assessment of a savings institution s CRA performance, the OCC assigns ratings of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance. The Company s CRA performance was rated by the OCC as outstanding in their most recent CRA examination which was completed in 2022.

The Bank is also subject to federal fair lending laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA and the Federal Housing Act FHA ), which
 prohibit discrimination in credit and residential real estate transactions on prohibited bases, including race, color, national origin, gender, and religion, among others. A lender may be liable under one or both acts in the event of overt
 discrimination, disparate treatment, or a disparate impact on a prohibited basis. The compliance of national banks with these acts is primarily supervised and enforced by the OCC. If the OCC determines that a lender has engaged in a pattern or
 practice of discrimination in violation of ECOA, the OCC refers the matter to the DOJ. Similarly, HUD is notified of violations of the FHA.

The USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), and Anti Money Laundering AML Requirements

The USA PATRIOT Act was enacted after September 11, 2001 to provide the federal government with powers to prevent, detect, and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering, and has resulted
 in the promulgation of several regulations that have a direct impact on savings associations. Financial institutions must have a number of programs in place to comply with this law, including: (i) a program to manage BSA/AML risk; (ii) a customer
 identification program designed to determine the true identity of customers, document and verify the information, and determine whether the customer appears on any federal government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations;
 and (iii) a program for monitoring for the timely detection and reporting of suspicious activity and reportable transactions. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in regulatory action, including the issuance of cease and desist
 orders, impositions of civil money penalties and adverse changes in an institution s regulatory ratings, which could adversely affect its ability to obtain regulatory approvals for business combinations or other desired business objectives.

Privacy Protection

City First is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of federal law. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with
 whom it shares nonpublic personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also require City First to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that
 accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not covered by an exception, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having City First share
 their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties.

City First is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies expectations for the creation, implementation,
 and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth
 in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access
 to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

Cybersecurity

In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in depth, layered, defensive
 approach that leverages people, processes, and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to
 report on any suspected persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cybersecurity attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in
 defensive measures. While to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third party service providers
 are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future.

19 

Table of Contents 

The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a banking
 organization s the board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third parties in the
 provision of financial services.

Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to
 the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology based products and services by us and our customers.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

As a bank holding company, we are subject to the supervision, regulation, and examination of the FRB and the FRBR. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Company. Applicable statutes
 and regulations administered by the FRB place certain restrictions on our activities and investments. Among other things, we are generally prohibited, either directly or indirectly, from acquiring more than 5 of the voting shares of any depository
 or depository holding company that is not a subsidiary of the Company.

The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, acting directly or indirectly or in concert with one or more persons, from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been given
 60 days prior written notice of such proposed acquisition and within that time period the FRB has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition or extending for up to another 30 days the period during which a disapproval may be issued.
 The term control is defined for this purpose to include ownership or control of, or holding with power to vote, 25 or more of any class of a bank holding company s voting securities. Under a rebuttable presumption contained in the regulations of
 the FRB, ownership or control of, or holding with power to vote, 10 or more of any class of voting securities of a bank company will be deemed control for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act if the institution (i) has registered securities
 under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or (ii) no person will own, control, or have the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. In addition, any company acting directly or indirectly
 or in concert with one or more persons or through one or more subsidiaries would be required to obtain the approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, before acquiring control of a bank holding company. For this
 purpose, a company is deemed to have control of a bank holding company if the company (i) owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 25 or more of any class of voting shares of the holding company, (ii) contributes
 more than 25 of the holding company s capital, (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the holding company s directors, or (iv) directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the
 national bank or other company. The FRB may also determine, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, that a company has otherwise acquired control of a bank holding company.

Restrictions on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions

In general, the prompt corrective action regulations prohibit a national bank from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distribution, or paying a management fee to a controlling person,
 such as its parent holding company, if, following the distribution or payment, the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories set out in the regulations. In addition to the prompt corrective action restriction on
 paying dividends, OCC regulations limit certain capital distributions by national banks. Capital distributions are defined to include, among other things, dividends and payments for stock repurchases and payments of cash to stockholders in
 mergers.

Under the OCC capital distribution regulations, a national bank that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company must notify the OCC at least 30 days prior to the declaration of any capital distribution
 by its national bank subsidiary. The 30 day period provides the OCC an opportunity to object to the proposed dividend if it believes that the dividend would not be advisable.

An application to the OCC for approval to pay a dividend is required if: (i) the total of all capital distributions made during that calendar year (including the proposed distribution) exceeds the sum
 of the institution s year to date net income and its retained income for the preceding two years; (ii) the institution is not entitled under OCC regulations to expedited treatment (which is generally available to institutions the OCC regards as
 well run and adequately capitalized); (iii) the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the proposed capital distribution; or (iv) the distribution would violate an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or
 condition imposed on the institution by the OCC.

The Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company is also subject to a restriction if the Bank s regulatory capital would be reduced below the
 amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with the conversion of the Bank from the mutual to the stock form of organization.

See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for a further description of dividend and other capital distribution
 limitations to which the Company and the Bank are subject.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

We are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our businesses. The discussion below
 addresses material factors, of which we are currently aware, that could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to
 future events, expectations, trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties should not be
 considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties that we might face. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.

Risks Relating to Our Business 

The macroeconomic environment could pose significant
 challenges for the Company and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Inflation poses risk to the economy overall and could indirectly pose challenges
 to our clients and to our business. Elevated inflation can impact our business customers through loss of purchasing power for their customers, leading to lower sales. Rising inflation can also increase input and inventory costs for our customers,
 forcing them to raise their prices or lower their profitability. Supply chain disruption, also leading to inflation, can delay our customers shipping ability, or timing on receiving inputs for their production or inventory. Inflation can lead to
 higher wages for our commercial customers, increasing costs. All of these inflationary risks for our commercial customer base can be financially detrimental, leading to increased likelihood that the customer may default on a loan.

In addition, sustained inflationary pressure has led the Federal Reserve to raise
 interest rates several times during 2022, which increases our interest rate risk. The failure of three regional banks in March 2023 and the resultant negative outlook on the banking sector has created concern regarding the exposure of banks to interest rate risk, and the exposure of banks to unrecognized investment losses due to investments classified as held to maturity on the balance sheet. Also, analysts
 have been monitoring the level of uninsured deposits in banks due to the liquidity risk associated with high levels of uninsured deposits. To the extent such conditions
 exist or worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including hostilities between Russia
 and Ukraine, terrorism, or other geopolitical events.

Our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry in the
 greater Washington , D.C. and Los Angeles metropolitan areas.

We face strong competition in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the Southern California Market. We compete with many different types of
 financial institutions, including commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, and money market funds, as well as other local and community, super-regional,
 national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services
 environment. Many of our competitors in the greater Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are well-established, larger financial institutions that have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting
 business. Failure to compete effectively and to attract new or to retain existing clients may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, assets, or business.

A downturn in the real estate market could seriously impair our loan portfolio and operating results.

Most of our loan portfolio consists of loans secured by various types of real estate located in Southern California and in Washington, D.C., and
 surrounding areas. If economic factors cause real estate values in the markets we serve to decline, higher vacancies to occur, or the deterioration of other factors, including , for
 example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, then the financial condition of the Bank s borrowers could be harmed, and the collateral for loans will provide less security. In addition, a decline in real estate values in the regions
 served could result in the Bank experiencing increases in loan delinquencies and defaults, which result in increases in the amounts of nonperforming assets and which would likely cause the Bank to suffer losses.

Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.

The Bank seeks to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans made. Losses nevertheless occur from time to time . The Bank has established allowances for estimated loan losses in its accounting records through loss provisions which are recorded as expenses that reduce income.
 The Bank has based decisions on the amount of these loss provisions and allowances that are prudent from time to time on estimates of the following factors, among others:

historical experience with its loans;

evaluation of current economic conditions;

reviews of the quality, mix and size of the overall loan portfolio;

reviews of loan delinquencies, including trends in such delinquencies; and

the quality of the collateral underlying loans, based in part on independent appraisals by third parties.

22 

Table of Contents 

If the Bank s actual loan losses exceed the amount that has been allocated for estimated probable losses, our net income and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Evaluation
 of many of the factors that are relevant to the determination of the appropriate levels of loss provisions and allowances is an inherently subjective process, and our conclusions are subject to review by our regulators in the course of regular
 periodic and special examinations of the Bank. The regulatory examiners may make different judgments on such matters based on the information available to them at the times of their examinations and may require that we increase the amounts of loss
 provisions and allowances.

In addition, in June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a new accounting standard that will replace the current historical approach

under GAAP for establishing the allowance for loan losses, which generally considers only past events and current conditions. This new standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss CECL ), requires financial institutions to project a
 loan s lifetime losses at origination, as opposed to the current framework which allows adjustments to the provision for loan and lease losses when losses are assessed as probable in an existing loan. Under ASU 2016-13,
 available-for-sale debt securities are evaluated for impairment if fair value is less than amortized cost, with any estimated credit losses recorded through a credit loss expense and an allowance, rather than a write-down of the investment.
 Changes in fair value that are not credit-related will continue to be recorded in other comprehensive income. On November 15, 2019, FASB issued a new accounting
 standard, which delayed the effective date of CECL for small banking institutions to interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The new standard is expected to result generally in increases to loan loss allowance levels
 and requires the application of the revised methodology to existing financial
 assets through a one-time adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2023. The Company is currently finalizing its CECL implementation by validating the data in the model, preparing supporting documentation, and developing policies and
 procedures during the first quarter of 2023. 

Changes in interest rates affect profitability.

Changes in prevailing interest rates adversely affect our business. We derive income
 mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the wider the spread, the
 more we will earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest the Bank receives on assets and the interest paid on liabilities will fluctuate. In addition, the timing and rate of change in the interest that the Bank earns on assets do
 not necessarily match the timing and rate of change in the interest that it must pay on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, even though most of the loans have adjustable rate features . This causes increases or decreases
 in the spread and can greatly affect income. Also, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio will continue to decrease due to increases in interest rates. In addition, interest rate fluctuations can affect how much money
 the Bank may be able to lend and its ability to attract and retain customer deposits, which are an important source of funds for making and holding loans. 

Changes in governmental regulation may impair operations or restrict growth.

We are subject to substantial governmental supervision and regulation, which are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than our
 stockholders. Statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time, and the interpretation of existing statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change. Within the last several years , Congress and the federal bank regulatory authorities have made significant changes to these statutes and regulations. There can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or
 in their interpretation will not adversely affect our business. We are also subject to changes in other federal and state laws, including changes in tax laws, which could
 materially affect the banking industry. If we fail to comply with federal bank regulations, our regulators may limit our activities or growth, assess civil money penalties against us or place the Bank into conservatorship or receivership. Bank
 regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated or are less regulated.

Negative public opinion regarding us or the failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect
 our business and prevent us from growing our business.

Our reputation within the communities we serve is critical to our success. We believe we have built strong personal and professional relationships with
 our customers and are an active member of the communities we serve. If our reputation is negatively affected, including as a result of actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new customers or talent or may
 lose existing customers, and our business, financial condition and earnings could be adversely affected.

We may not be successful in retaining key employees.

Our success will depend in part on its ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees terminate their employment, our
 business activities may be adversely affected and management s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating operating our business to hiring suitable replacements, which may cause our business to suffer. In addition, we may not be able
 to locate or retain suitable replacements in a timely manner if at all for any key employees who leave the Company.

We may not be successful in seeking future awards under the United States Department of the Treasury CDFI Fund s New Markets Tax
 Credit NMTC program or such program may not receive Congressional support in the future.

We may not be able to obtain new NMTC awards due to unsuccessful applications, inability to meet program requirements, or failure of Congress to
 further extend the program. Federal government agencies periodically determine NMTC award recipients through a nationwide application process that is highly competitive. Although we have received prior NMTC awards, we may not be successful in
 future NMTC applications, or may not meet the qualifications to apply for NMTC awards, and may not be able to successfully expand our current NMTC lending program into the Southern California market. The NMTC program relies on Congressional
 extension of the program; in 2020, the program was extended through 2025. If the NMTC program requirements change so we are unable to qualify, or the program does not receive Congressional support after 2025, we will no longer be able to continue
 our participation in the NMTC program. Failure to obtain new NMTC awards may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, assets or business.

If we were to lose our status as a CDFI, our ability to obtain grants and awards as a CDFI similar to those received in the past may
 be lost.

The Bank and the Company are certified as CDFIs by the United States Department of the Treasury. CDFI status increases a financial institution s
 potential for receiving grants and awards that, in turn, enable the financial institution to increase the level of community development financial services that it provides to communities. Broadway Federal Bank received over 3 million in Bank
 Enterprise Awards from the CDFI Fund over the last ten years. We reinvest the proceeds from CDFI-related grants and awards back into the communities we serve. While we believe we will be able to meet the certification criteria required to continue
 our CDFI status, there is no certainty that we will be able to do so. If we do not meet one or more of the criteria, the CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may provide an opportunity for us to cure deficiencies prior to issuing a notice of
 termination of certification. A loss of CDFI status, and the resulting inability to obtain certain grants and awards received in the past, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business.

Systems failures, interruptions and cybersecurity breaches in our information technology and telecommunications systems and of
 third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and the systems
 of its third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology
 and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity, or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant,
 sustained, or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial
 liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our information technology systems and of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing
 schemes and other security breaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. However, there can be no certainty that these measures will be sufficient in safeguarding against any such threats. Security breaches and viruses potentially exposing sensitive
 data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our customers and employees, could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny,
 litigation costs and other possible liabilities and reputational harm.

The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology or may experience operational
 challenges when implementing new technology.

The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases
 efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs while increasing customer service and convenience. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide
 products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as
 we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in us not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or incurring significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.

Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those
 that we are able to provide, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services.

The markets in which we operate are susceptible to natural disasters, including earthquakes, fires, drought, flooding, and other catastrophic events, any of which could result in a disruption of our operations and increases in loan losses.

A significant portion of our business is generated from markets that have been, and will continue to be, susceptible to
 damage by earthquakes, fires, drought, major seasonal flooding, and other natural disasters and catastrophic events. In addition, natural disasters and other adverse external
 events can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. The value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be materially and adversely affected by a
 disaster, resulting in decreased revenue and loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If the economies in our primary markets experience an overall decline as a result of
 a natural disaster, adverse weather, or other catastrophic event, demand for loans and our other products and services could be reduced. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and loan losses may increase
 substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.

Risks Relating to the Company Being a Public Benefit Corporation 

We cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purposes.

As a public benefit corporation, we are required to seek to produce a public benefit or benefits and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner, balancing our stockholders pecuniary
 interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or benefits identified by our certificate of incorporation. There is no assurance that we will achieve our public benefit purposes or that the
 expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
 assets, or business. As a public benefit corporation, we are required to report publicly at least biennially on the overall public benefit performance and on the assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are
 not timely in providing this report or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or who are regulators or others reviewing its credentials, our reputation and status as a public
 benefit corporation may be harmed.

As a Delaware public benefit corporation, our focus on specific public benefit purposes and producing a positive effect for society
 can negatively impact our financial performance.

Unlike traditional corporations, which have a fiduciary duty to focus primarily on maximizing stockholder value, directors of the Company (as a public
 benefit corporation) have a fiduciary duty to consider not only our stockholders interests, but also the Company s specific public benefit purposes and the interests of other stakeholder constituencies and to balance those interests in making
 business decisions. As a result, we take actions that we believe to be in the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our specific benefit purposes, even if those actions do not further our stockholder s pecuniary interests.
 While we intend our status a public benefit corporation to provide an overall net benefit to the Company, our customers, employees, community, and stockholders, it could instead cause us to make decisions and take actions that may not maximize the
 income generated from our business. Our pursuit of longer-term or non-pecuniary benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with the related obligations can have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, assets or business.

Furthermore, as a public benefit corporation, we may be less attractive as a takeover target than a traditional company would be and, therefore, our
 stockholders ability to realize their investment through an acquisition may be reduced. Public benefit corporations may also not be attractive targets for activists or hedge fund investors because directors are required to balance our stockholders pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the public benefit or benefits identified by the Company s certificate of
 incorporation, and stockholders committed to the public benefit can bring a suit to enforce this balancing requirement. Further, because the board of directors of a public benefit corporation considers additional constituencies rather than just
 maximizing stockholder value, Delaware public benefit corporation law could make it easier for a board to reject a hostile bid, even if the takeover would provide the greatest short-term financial gain to stockholders.

As a Delaware public benefit corporation, the Company s directors have a fiduciary duty to consider not only our stockholders interests, but also the specific public benefit
 purposes we have committed to promote and the interests of other stakeholder constituencies. If a conflict between such interests arises, there is no guarantee such conflict would be resolved in favor of the interests of our stockholders.

While directors of traditional corporations are required to make decisions they believe to be in the best interests of their stockholders, directors of a public benefit corporation have a fiduciary
 duty to consider not only the stockholders interests, but also the company s specific public benefit purposes and the interests of other stakeholder constituencies. Under Delaware law, directors are shielded from liability for breach of their
 fiduciary duties if they make informed and disinterested decisions that serve a rational purpose. Unlike traditional corporations which must focus exclusively on stockholder value, as a public benefit corporation, our directors are not merely
 permitted, but obligated, to consider, in addition to the interests of stockholders, the Company s specific public benefit purposes and the interests of other stakeholder constituencies in making business decisions. In the event of a conflict
 between the interests of our stockholders and the specific public benefit purposes we have committed to promote and the interests of other stakeholder constituencies, our directors are obligated to balance those interests, and are deemed to have
 satisfied their fiduciary duties as long as their decisions are informed and disinterested and are not decisions that no person of ordinary, sound judgment would approve. As a result, there is no certainty that a conflict would be resolved in favor
 of our stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, assets or business.

As a Delaware public benefit corporation, we may be subject to increased derivative litigation concerning our duty to balance stockholder and public benefit interests, the
 occurrence of which may have an adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.

Stockholders of a Delaware public benefit corporation (if they, individually or collectively, own at least two percent of the company s outstanding shares or, in the case of a corporation with shares
 listed on a national securities exchange, the lesser of such percentage or shares with a market value of at least 2 million as of the date the action is filed) are entitled to file a lawsuit (individual, derivative, or any other type of action)
 claiming the directors failed to balance stockholder and public benefit interests. This potential claim does not exist for traditional corporations. Therefore, we may be subject to the possibility of increased derivative litigation, which would
 require the attention of our management, and, as a result, may adversely impact management s ability to effectively execute our strategy. Additionally, such derivative litigation may be costly, which may have an adverse impact on our financial
 condition, results of operations, assets, or business.

General Risk Factors 

The market price of our common stock is volatile. Stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at times or at prices they find attractive.

The trading price of our common stock has historically and will likely in the
 future fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, including the following:

actual or anticipated changes in our operating results and financial condition;

actions by our stockholders, including sales of common stock by substantial stockholders and/or directors and executive officers, or perceptions that such actions may occur;

the limited number of shares of our common stock that are held by the general public, commonly called the public float, and our small market capitalization;

failure to meet stockholder or market expectations regarding loan and deposit volume, revenue, asset quality or earnings;

failure to meet Nasdaq listing requirements , including failure to satisfy the 1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement ;

speculation in the press or the investment community relating to the Company or the financial services industry generally;

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;

investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us;

the performance of the national, California and Washington, D.C. economies and the real estate markets in Southern California and Washington, D.C.;

general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;

additions or departures of key personnel;

changes in financial estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts with respect to our common stock or those of other financial institutions; and

actions taken by bank regulatory authorities, including required additions to our loan loss reserves or the issuance of cease and desist orders, based on adverse evaluations of our loans and other assets,
 operating results, or management practices and procedures or other aspects of our business.

We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since 2010 and we may not pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.

We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock since June 2010, initially due, in part, to regulatory restrictions and the operating losses we have previously experienced. We have not
 determined to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the near future.

Stock sales by us or other dilution of our equity may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

The issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or securities that are convertible into our common stock, may be determined to be necessary or advisable at times when our stock price is below
 book value, which could be substantially dilutive to existing holders of our common stock. The market value of our common stock could also decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of our common stock or any future class or
 series of stock or the perception that such sales could occur.

Anti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, federal and state law and our stockholder rights plan may limit the ability of another party to acquire the
 Company, which could depress our stock price.

Various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain other actions that we have taken could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring control of the Company even if such a
 transaction might be considered beneficial by our stockholders. These include, among others, our classified board of directors, the fact that directors may only be removed for cause, advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of
 director candidates or presenting proposals at our annual stockholder meetings, super-majority stockholder voting requirements for amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and for certain business combination transactions, and the
 authorization to issue blank check preferred stock by action of our board of directors, without obtaining stockholder approval. In addition, we approved a stockholder rights plan in September 2019, the purpose of which was to protect our
 stockholders against the possibility of attempts to acquire control of or influence over the Company through open market or privately negotiated purchases of our common stock without payment of a fair price to all of our stockholders or through
 other tactics that do not provide fair treatment to all stockholders. These provisions and the stockholder rights plan could be used by our board of directors to prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could
 limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.

Our common stock is not insured and stockholders could lose the value of their entire investment.

An investment in shares of our common stock is not a deposit and is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC or any other government agency or
 authority.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our
 financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors that have affected our reported results of operations and financial condition or may affect our future results or financial condition. The following discussion should be read
 in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Merger with CFBanc Corporation

On April 1, 2021, the Company completed its Merger with CFBanc, with Broadway Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. Prior to the
 acquisition, CFBanc was headquartered in Washington, D.C. and conducted its business through its wholly-owned national bank subsidiary, City First Bank of D.C., National Association. Immediately following this merger, Broadway Federal, a subsidiary
 of Broadway Financial Corporation, merged with and into City First Bank of D.C., National Association, with City First Bank of D.C., National Association continuing as the surviving entity (which concurrently changed its name to City First Bank,
 National Association).

In connection with the Merger, in exchange for the then outstanding common and preferred shares of CFBanc, the Company issued to holders of CFBanc
 shares 13,999,879 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock and 11,404,621 of Class B Common Stock which were valued at 2.49 per share (the closing price of the Company s shares the day prior to the acquisition), along with 3,000 shares of
 Series A Preferred Stock with a par value of 1,000 per share. The total consideration paid on the acquisition date was valued at 66.3 million.

As of the Merger date, CFBanc had 471.0 million in total assets, 227.7 million in gross loans, and 353.7 million of total deposits. As a result of
 the Merger, the Company recorded goodwill of 26.0 million. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits rising from net assets acquired that are not individually identified and separately recognized and is attributable to synergies expected to
 be derived from the combination of the two entities. Goodwill recognized in this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, assets acquired,
 liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
 determined based on the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 820: Fair Value Measurements.

Issuance of Shares Under the Emergency Capital Investment Program

On June 7, 2022, Broadway Financial Corporation closed a private placement of shares of the Company s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
 Stock, Series C, par value 0.01, pursuant to a Letter Agreement (collectively with the annexes, exhibits and schedules thereto, including the Securities Purchase Agreement - Standard Terms, dated as of June 7, 2022, with the United States
 Department of the Treasury. The Purchase Agreement was entered into pursuant to the Purchaser s Emergency Capital Investment Program.

Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser acquired an aggregate of 150,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price
 equal to 150.0 million in cash. The liquidation value of the Series C Preferred Stock is 1,000 per share.

In June 2022 the Company down streamed 75 million of the proceeds from the Private Placement to the Bank to enhance capital. As a result of the downstream, the Bank s
 tier 1 leverage ratio increased to 15.75 as of December 31, 2022 from 9.32 from December 31, 2021.

Overview

Total assets increased by 90.8 million at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to growth in investment securities
 available-for-sale of 172.4 million and growth in net loans of 119.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of 215.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. The increases in total assets, which resulted from the proceeds from the sale of
 150.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock and additional borrowings of 53.9 million, were partially offset by deposit outflows of 101.1 million, and fair value adjustments on the investment securities portfolio of 16.9 million, net of taxes. 
 The decrease in deposits was primarily due to customers removing funds as they found other financial institutions paying higher interest rates on deposits.

Total liabilities decreased by 47.8 million to 904.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 952.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in total
 liabilities during 2022 resulted primarily from decreases in deposits of 101.1 million, partially offset by increases of 42.4 million in FHLB advances and 11.5 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase . 

We recorded net income of 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 or 0.08 per share compared to a net loss of 4.1 million or 0.07 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was
 significantly impacted by Merger-related costs of 5.6 million 4.2 million net of tax) and 2.4 million of data conversion costs in 2021.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021

General

Our most significant source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income and our interest expense. Generally, interest income is generated from our loans and
 investments (interest earning assets) and interest expense is incurred from deposits and borrowings (interest-bearing liabilities). Typically, our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income
 generated from service charges and fees on loan and deposit accounts, gains or losses on the sale of loans and REO, non-interest expenses, and income taxes.

Net Interest Income

For the year ended December 31, 2022, net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by 11.9 million, or 56.5 , to 32.9 million, compared to 21.0 million for the year ended December
 31, 2021. The increase was attributable to additional interest income earned on growth of 211.5 million in average interest earning assets.

Interest income and fees on loans receivable increased by 5.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an
 increase of 137.0 million in the average balance of loans receivable which increased interest income by 5.8 million. In addition, there was an increase in the average loan yield from 4.24 for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 4.26 for the
 year ended December 31, 2022, which increased interest income by 70 thousand.

Interest income on securities increased by 4.2 million to 5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest
 income on securities primarily resulted from an increase of 130.7 million in the average balance of securities due to the deployment of the 150.0 million ECIP funds into securities during June 2022, which increased interest income by 2.2
 million. In addition, we had an increase of 107 basis points in the average interest yield earned on investment securities during 2022, which reflected the rising interest rate environment and increased interest income by 2.0 million.

29 

Table of Contents 

Other interest income increased by 1.4 million in 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to an increase of 99 basis points in average yield which increased interest income by 1.5
 million. This was partially offset by a 56.0 million decrease in average cash balances which resulted in a 105 thousand decrease in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company
 also recorded 41 thousand in higher interest income on regulatory stock during 2022, primarily due to dividends earned on FRB and FHLB stock.

Interest expense on deposits increased by 428 thousand during calendar 2022, compared to calendar 2021, due to an increase of 3 basis points in the average cost of deposits. The average cost of
 deposits increased to 0.29 for 2022, compared to 0.26 for 2021, which increased interest expense by 270 thousand. In addition, we had an increase of 89.4 million in the average balance of deposits, which increased interest expense by 158
 thousand.

Interest expense on borrowings decreased by 768 thousand to 1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.1 million during
 the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity and early payoff of advances from the FHLB of San Francisco early in 2022 that resulted in a
 decrease of 22 basis points in the average rate which reduced expense by 202 thousand. In addition, interest on FHLB advances decreased by 695 thousand due to a decrease of 38.9 million in the average balance of outstanding FHLB advances.
 Interest expense decreased by another 60 thousand in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the pay-off of the Company s remaining junior subordinated debentures in September of 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the effects of a net increase
 of 14.3 million in borrowings under securities sold under agreements to repurchase which increased interest expenses by 18 thousand and an increase in the average rate paid on securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 28 basis points
 compared to the prior year which increased interest expense by 171 thousand.

The net interest margin increased to 3.05 for the year ended 2022 from 2.42 for year ended 2021, primarily due to an improvement of 50 basis points in the average yield earned on average
 interest-earning assets. Also, the average cost of funds decreased to 0.40 for the year ended 2022 from 0.47 for the year ended 2021, due to the pay down of subordinated debt in late 2021 and advances from the FHLB of San Francisco early in 2022,
 which more than offset higher rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, particularly during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, after the rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The balance of the increase in the net interest margin was
 attributable to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of the Series C Preferred Stock, which increased interest earning assets without any associated interest cost.

Analysis of Net Interest Income 

Net interest income is the difference between income on interest earning assets and
 the expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. The following table sets forth average
 balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan fees, deferred origination costs, and
 discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. We do not accrue interest on loans that are on non-accrual status; however, the balance of these loans is included in the total average balance, which has the
 effect of reducing average loan yields.

Loan Loss Provision

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a provision for loan losses of 997 thousand, compared to a loan loss provision of 176 thousand during the same period in 2021. The net increase
 in the required loan loss provision in calendar 2022 was due to growth in the loan portfolio during the year. No loan charge-offs or recoveries were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. See Allowance for Loan Losses for
 additional information.

Non Interest Income

For the year ended December 31, 2022, non-interest income totaled 1.2 million, compared to 3.2 million for the prior year. The decrease of 2.0 million in non-interest income was
 primarily the result of non-recurring income of 1.8 million from a special grant from the U.S. Treasury s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund recognized during 2021.

Non Interest Expense

Non-interest expenses totaled 24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of 4.0 million in
 non-interest expenses during 2022 was primarily from decreases in compensation and benefits expenses of 1.7 million, information services expenses of 884 thousand, and professional services expenses of 943 thousand, due to one-time
 Merger-related costs included in the results for 2021, and to a lesser extent, decreases in corporate insurance, supervisory/regulatory costs, occupancy expense and office services/supplies. The Company s results for the year ended December 31,
 2021 reflect the consolidated operations of CFB since the Merger on April 1, 2021.

The decrease of 1.7 million in compensation and benefits expense during 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to accruals for merger-related costs during 2021, offset by the additional cost of
 hiring new employees to fill new roles based on the larger size of the combined organization (for example, a Chief Human Resources Director and an Information Technology Officer). Also, the increase was partially a result of an increase in accrued
 bonuses and retention payments.

Information services expenses decreased by 884 thousand to 2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was
 primarily due to non-recurring data processing costs recorded in 2021 to migrate the Company s information systems to a common platform.

Supervisory costs decreased by 80 thousand to 413 thousand for 2022 from 493 thousand for 2021 due to the decrease in deposit insurance due to a reduction in deposits from 788.1 million at
 December 31, 2021 to 686.9 million at December 31, 2022.

Professional services expenses were 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 943 thousand from 3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease largely related
 to one-time costs associated with the Merger during 2021.

Other operating costs remained the same at 2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense or benefit is computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 . State taxes are recorded at the State of California tax rate and apportioned based on
 an allocation schedule to reflect that a portion of the Bank s operations are conducted in the Washington, D.C. area. The Company recorded an income tax expense of 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an effective tax
 rate of 29.7 , compared to an income tax benefit of 937 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an effective tax benefit rate of 19.2 . The income tax benefit for the calendar 2022 is net of a valuation allowance of 369
 thousand on the Company s deferred tax assets to record the write down of the tax benefits from net operating losses for the State of California, net of the federal tax benefit. The valuation allowance was necessary because shares of
 common stock that the Company issued in private placements in the second quarter of 2021 triggered a limitation on the use of the Company s net operating loss carryforwards.

Our deferred tax asset totaled 11.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 6.1 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Income Taxes of the Notes
 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes and a reconciliation of income tax at the federal statutory tax rate to the actual income tax benefit.

Total Assets

Total assets increased by 90.8 million to 1.2 billion at December 31, 2022, from
 1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets was primarily due to cash proceeds from the sale of 150.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock in 2022 and cash proceeds from borrowings from the FHLB, offset by declines
 in deposits.

Securities Available-For-Sale

As of December 31, 2022, we had 328.7 million of investment securities classified as available-for-sale, compared to 156.4 million at December 31, 2021. The increase during 2022 was primarily due to
 the deployment of 15.0 million of the 150.0 million ECIP funds into investment securities in June. The remainder of the increase was due to investing liquidity dollars into higher-yielding short-term securities. This increase was partially
 offset by 16.2 million decline in the fair value of investment securities available-for-sale, net of taxes, during the year ended December 31, 2022. These decreases in the fair values of available-for-sale investment securities during 2022 were
 the result of increases in market interest rates, which caused the fair value of the Company s fixed rate investments to decrease. The declines in fair value were not the result of a change in the creditworthiness of any of the issuers of those
 securities.

Loans Receivable Held for Investment

Loans receivable held for investment, net of the allowance for loan losses, totaled 768.0 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 648.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase of 119.5 million
 in loans receivable held for investment during 2022 was primarily due originations of 273.4 million in new loans, 141.6 million of which multi-family loans, 75.3 million of which were commercial real estate loans, 29.6 million of which were
 construction loans and 26.9 million of which were other loans. Loan repayments during 2022 totaled 154.0 million .

During 2021, the Bank originated 267.0 million in new loans, 167.1 million of which were multi-family loans, 43.6 million of which were commercial real estate loans, 26.5 million of which were PPP
 loans, 24.9 million of which construction loans, and 24.9 million of which were commercial loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses

As a smaller reporting company as defined by the SEC, we are not required to adopt the current expected credit losses, or CECL, accounting standard
 until January 1, 2023 . The Company is currently finalizing the CECL model by validating the data, preparing supporting documentation, and developing policies and procedures.
 Consequently , the Bank s ALLL is based on evidence available at the date of preparation of its financial statements (incurred loss method), rather than projections of future economic conditions over the life of the loans. In determining
 the adequacy of the ALLL within the context of the current uncertainties in the economic environment, management has considered the historical and current performance of the Bank s portfolio, as well as various measures of the quality and safety of
 the portfolio, such as debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios.

We record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings when necessary , in
 order to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient, in management s judgment, to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. At least quarterly we assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and general economic trends in the local
 market. The determination of the appropriate level for the allowance is based on that review, considering such factors as historical loss experience for each type of loan, the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the levels and composition
 of our loan delinquencies, non performing loans and net loan charge offs, the value of underlying collateral on problem loans, regulatory policies, general economic conditions, and other factors related to the collectability of loans in the
 portfolio.

Our ALLL was 4.4 million or 0.57 of our gross loans receivable held for investment at December 31, 2022 compared to 3.4 million, or 0.52 of our gross loans receivable held for investment at
 December 31, 2021. The ALLL as a percentage of gross loans increased during 2022 due to loan loss provisions on new loan originations at an average of 0.65 . During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded loan loss provisions of
 997 thousand and 176 thousand, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, we had no delinquent loans compared to 2.4 million of loan delinquencies at December 31, 2021. Our NPLs consist of delinquent loans that are 90 days or more past due and
 other loans, including troubled debt restructurings that do not qualify for accrual status. At December 31, 2022, NPLs totaled 144 thousand (or 0.02 of gross loans) compared to 684 thousand (or 0.10 of gross loans) at December 31, 2021. The
 decrease in NPLs was the result of payments received from borrowers that were applied to the outstanding principal balance. The Bank did not have any REO at December 31, 2022 or 2021. There were no modified loans or trouble debt restructurings
 during 2022.

When reviewing the adequacy of the ALLL, we also consider the impact of charge offs, including the changes and trends in loan charge offs.

33 

Table of Contents 

We had no loan charge-offs or recoveries during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Impaired loans at December 31, 2022 were 1.7 million, compared to 2.3 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease of 589 thousand in impaired loans was primarily due to payoffs and repayments.
 Specific reserves for impaired loans were 7 thousand or 0.41 of the aggregate impaired loan amount at December 31, 2022 compared to 7 thousand, or 0.30 of the aggregate impaired loan amount at December 31, 2021. Excluding specific reserves for
 impaired loans, our coverage ratio (general allowance as a percentage of total non impaired loans) was 0.57 at December 31, 2022 compared to 0.52 at December 31, 2021.

We believe the ALLL is adequate to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022, but because of uncertainty regarding the future value of commercial real estate , there can be no assurance that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts. In addition, the OCC and the
 FDIC periodically review the ALLL as an integral part of their examination process. These agencies may require an increase in the ALLL based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examinations.

The Company is currently finalizing the CECL model by validating the data, 
 preparing supporting documentation, and developing policies and procedures with adoption of ASU 2016-13 (CECL) in the fir st quarter of 2023. See Note 1 Summary of Significant
 Accounting Policies to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Office Properties and Equipment, Net

Net office properties and equipment decreased by 53 thousand to 10.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 10.3 million as of December 31, 2021. Depreciation expense was 376 thousand and 287 thousand
 for the years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangible

As a result of the Merger , the Company recorded 26.0 million of goodwill.
 Goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination that is determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate the
 necessity for such impairment tests to be performed. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded 138 thousand of change in deferred tax estimate expense related to the goodwill asset.

No impairment charges were recorded during 2022 for goodwill impairment. Management s assessment of goodwill is performed in accordance with ASC 350-20 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which allows
 the Company to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not the fair value of the Company s equity is below its carrying value. The Company performed its qualitative assessment as of December 31, 2022.

The Company recorded 3.3 million of core deposit intangible asset as a result of the merger. The core deposit intangible asset is amortized on an
 accelerated basis reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up. The estimated life of the core deposit intangible is approximately 10 years. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
 the Company recorded 435 thousand of amortization expense related to the core deposit intangible asset.

The following table outlines the estimated amortization expense related to the core deposit intangible asset during the next five fiscal years and
 thereafter:

Total Liabilities

Total liabilities decreased by 47.8 million to 904.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 952.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in total liabilities was primarily comprised of decreases of
 101.1 million in deposits, partially offset by a 42.4 million increase in FHLB advances and an 11.5 million increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Table of Contents 

Deposits

Deposits at December 31, 2022 were 686.9 million compared to 788.1 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in deposits of 101.1 million was primarily caused by a 73.1 million withdrawal of
 deposits by one long-term customer that needed funds for its own business needs at the end of the year. Also, some other depositors left the Bank for higher interest rates available elsewhere, even after management made reasonable attempts to be
 responsive to the higher interest rate environment.

Five customer relationships accounted for approximately 27 of our deposit balances at December 31, 2022. We expect to maintain these relationships with these customers for the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 212.9 million and 265.8 million of our total deposits were not insured by FDIC insurance.

Borrowings

Total borrowings at December 31, 2022 consisted of advances to the Bank from the FHLB of 128.3 million, repurchase agreements of 63.5 million, and borrowings associated with our Qualified Active
 Low-Income Business lending activities of 14.0 million, compared to advances from the FHLB of 86.0 million, repurchase agreements of 52.0 million, and borrowings associated with our Qualified Active Low-Income Business lending activities of
 14.0 million at December 31, 2021.

Balances of outstanding FHLB advances increased to 128.3 million at December 31, 2022, from 86.0 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to 95.5 million in advances from
 the FHLB of Atlanta, offset by repayments of 53.0 million of advances from the FHLB of San Francisco and 140 thousand of advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. The weighted average rate on FHLB advances was 3.74 
 at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.85 at December 31, 2021. 

The Bank enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities. Under these arrangements, the Bank may transfer
 legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Bank to repurchase the assets. As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing
 agreements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Banks s consolidated statements of financial condition, while the
 securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. As of
 December 31, 2022, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 63.5 million at an average rate of 0.38 . These agreements mature on a daily basis. The market value of securities pledged totaled 64.4 million as of December 31, 2022
 and included 33.3 million of federal agency debt, 19.2 million of U.S. Treasuries and 11.9 million of federal agency mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2021, securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 52.0 million at
 an average rate of 0.10 . The market value of securities pledged totaled 53.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and included 25.9 million of federal agency
 mortgage-backed securities, 13.3 million of federal agency debt, 9.8 million of SBA pool, and 4.2 million of federal
 agency CMO. 

Two customer relationships accounted for 97 of our balance of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. We expect to maintain these relationships for the foreseeable future.

In connection with the New Market Tax Credit activities of City First Bank, CFC 45 is a partnership whose members include CFNMA and City First New Markets Fund II, LLC. This CDE acts in effect as a
 pass-through for a Merrill Lynch allocation totaling 14.0 million that needed to be deployed. In December 2015, Merrill Lynch made a 14.0 million non-recourse loan to CFC 45, whereby CFC 45 passed that loan through to a QALICB. The loan to the
 QALICB is secured by a Leasehold Deed of Trust that, due to the pass-through, non-recourse structure, is operationally and ultimately for the benefit of Merrill Lynch rather than CFC 45. Debt service payments received by CFC 45 from the QALICB are
 passed through to Merrill Lynch in return for which CFC 45 receives a servicing fee. The financial statements of CFC 45 are consolidated with those of the Bank and the Company.

On September 17, 2021, the Company fully redeemed its Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures.

Stockholders Equity

Stockholders equity was 279.5 million, or 23.6 of the Company s total assets, at December 31, 2022, compared to 141.0 million, or 12.9 of the Company s total assets, at December 31, 2021. The
 Company issued 63.3 million in common stock at a price per share of 2.49 and 3.0 million in preferred stock in connection with the Merger. The Company raised 30.8 million in net proceeds (after costs of 2.0 million) from the sale of 18,474,000
 shares of common stock in private placements at a price of 1.78 per share immediately following the Merger on April 6, 2021. In addition, in 2022, the Company sold 150 million in preferred stock to the U.S Government under the ECIP Program.

During the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the exchange of all the Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, with an aggregate liquidation value of 3.0 million, plus
 accrued dividends, for 1,193,317 shares of Class A Common Stock at an exchange price of 2.51 per share of Class A Common Stock.

During December of 2022, the Company issued a 5 million line of credit to the ESOP Plan for the purchase of additional shares. As of December 31, 2022, the trustee for the ESOP had purchased 466,955
 thousand shares at a total cost of 500 thousand.

The Company s book value per common share was 1.76 at December 31, 2022, and its tangible book value per common share was 1.38 at December 31,
 2022. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measurement that excludes goodwill and the net unamortized core deposit intangible asset, which were both originally recorded in connection with the Merger. The Company uses this non-GAAP
 financial measure to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s financial condition and operational performance , and to enhance comparability with banks that
 have not recorded goodwill and core deposit intangibles in a merger transaction. A reconciliation between book value (calculated in accordance with GAAP) and
 tangible book value per common share December 31, 2022 is shown as follows:

Capital Resources

Our principal subsidiary, City First, must comply with capital standards established by the OCC in the conduct of its business. Failure to comply
 with such capital requirements may result in significant limitations on its business or other sanctions. As a small bank holding company , we are not subject to consolidated capital requirements under the new Basel III capital rules. The current
 regulatory capital requirements and possible consequences of failure to maintain compliance are described in Part I, Item 1 Business Regulation and in Note 18 Regulatory Matters 
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to fund operations and meet our obligations on a timely and cost-effective basis. The Bank s sources of funds
 include deposits, advances from the FHLB, other borrowings, proceeds from the sale of loans and investment securities, and payments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities. The Bank is currently approved by the FHLB of Atlanta
 to borrow up to 25 of total assets to the extent the Bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB stock. This approved limit and collateral requirement would have permitted the Bank to borrow an additional 70.6 million at
 December 31, 2022 based on pledged collateral. In addition, the Bank had additional lines of credit of 10.0 million with other financial institutions as of that date.

The Bank s primary uses of funds include withdrawals of and interest payments on deposits, originations of loans, purchases of investment securities, and the payment of operating expenses. Also, when
 the Bank has more funds than required for reserve requirements or short term liquidity needs, the Bank invests excess cash with the Federal Reserve Bank or other financial institutions. The Bank s liquid assets at December 31, 2022 consisted of
 16.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and 250.3 million in securities available for sale that were not pledged, compared to 231.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and 52.4 million in securities available for sale that were not pledged
 at December 31, 2021. We believe that the Bank has sufficient liquidity to support growth over the foreseeable future.

The Company s liquidity, separate from the Bank, is based primarily on the proceeds from financing transactions, such as the preferred stock sold to the U.S. Treasury in 2022 and the private
 placements completed in December 2016, and April 2021 and dividends received from the Bank in 2021 and 2022.

The Company recorded consolidated net cash inflows from operating activities of 6.3 million and 624 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash
 inflows from operating activities during 2022 were primarily attributable to net income of 5.7 million and a 1.5 million net change in deferred taxes . Net cash inflows from operating activities during
 2021 were primarily attributable to an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

The Company recorded consolidated net cash outflows from investing activities of 324.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and net cash inflows from investing activities of
 25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash outflows from investing activities during 2022 were primarily attributable to 215.5 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities and 119.9 of net loan originations . Net cash inflows from investing activities during 2021 were primarily attributable to 84.7 million of cash acquired in the Merger offset by net loan originations of 62.4 million and purchases of available-for-sale
 securities of 16.5 million.

Table of Contents 

The Company recorded consolidated net cash inflows from financing activities of 102.2 million and 109.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net
 cash inflows from financing activities during 2022 were primarily attributable to 150.0 million from the issuance of preferred stock, 95.5 million of proceeds from FHLB advances, offset by 101.1 million of net outflow of deposits and
 53.1 million of FHLB repayments. Net cash inflows from financing activities during 2021 were primarily attributable to a net inflow of deposits of 118.7 million and net proceeds of 30.8 million from the
 issuance of common stock, offset by net repayments of FHLB advances of 27.7 million, repayments of securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 8.0 million, and repayments of junior subordinated debentures of 3.3 million. 

We believe that the Company s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements and
 capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business, primarily in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. These instruments involve, to
 varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are either not recorded in the consolidated financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts.
 Such instruments primarily include lending commitments and lease commitments as described below.

Lending commitments include commitments to originate loans and to fund lines of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer if there is no violation of any condition
 established in the commitment. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total
 commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate creditworthiness on a case by case basis. Our maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments.

In addition to our lending commitments, we have contractual obligations related to operating lease commitments. Operating lease commitments are obligations under various non cancellable operating
 leases on buildings and land used for office space and banking purposes. The following table details our contractual obligations at December 31, 2022.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

Our consolidated financial statements, including accompanying notes, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP which require the measurement of financial position and operating results primarily in
 terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in increased costs of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all our
 assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same
 extent as the price of goods and services.

As a result, the Bank s performance is influenced by general macroeconomic 
 conditions, both domestic and foreign, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of the regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policies (such as seeking to curb inflation and
 combat recession) by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings
 by banks from the Federal Reserve Banks. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas can influence the growth of loans, investments, and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans, and deposits. The nature and impact of any
 future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted.

Critical Accounting Policies

Critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assessments by management, and which could potentially result in
 materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. This discussion highlights those accounting policies that management considers critical. All accounting policies are important, however, and therefore you are encouraged to
 review each of the policies included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to gain a better understanding of how our financial performance is measured and reported. Management
 has identified the Company s critical accounting policy as follows:

Table of Contents 

Allowance for Loan Losses

The determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used, and the potential for
 changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary. The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and the Board of Directors and is based on a
 periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral,
 prevailing economic conditions, and feedback from regulatory examinations. See Item 1, Business Asset Quality Allowance for Loan Losses for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

As of December 31, 2022, an evaluation was performed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO of the effectiveness of the design and
 operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.

Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Broadway Financial Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
 for the Company as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) under the Exchange Act. This system, which management has chosen to base on the framework set forth in Internal
 Control Integrated Framework , published by the 1992 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and which is effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, is designed to
 provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP .

The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
 the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
 and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
 acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of
 changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.

With the participation of the Company s CEO and CFO, management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
 evaluation, management determined that the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of internal control over
 financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
 over financial reporting. Certain immaterial changes to the Company s internal control over financial were made during the quarter.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Broadway Financial Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Broadway Financial Corporation and Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year s then ended, and the related notes (collectively, referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in
 conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
 Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit s . We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
 Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
 Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
 material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
 effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
 in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
 management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit s provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or
 required to be communicated to the audit committee, and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
 communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the
 critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses balance was 4.4 million at December 31, 2022. The
 allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Management estimates the
 allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The allowance consists
 of general and specific components. The general component covers loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by
 portfolio segment with the use of a loss migration analysis and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent five years. The Company assigns a risk rating to all loans based on historical loss experience
 and periodically performs detailed reviews of all such loans over a certain threshold to identify credit risks and assess overall collectability. This actual loss experience is supplemented with information about other current economic factors
 based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These current economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries; trends
 in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
 national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.

Table of Contents 

We identified management s risk ratings of loans and the estimation of current economic factors, both of which are used in the allowance for loan losses
 calculation, as critical audit matters. These estimates and underlying assumptions require significant management judgment in the evaluation of the credit quality and the estimation of incurred losses inherent within the loan portfolio as of
 the balance sheet date involved significant audit effort as well as especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.

The following are primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matters.

We tested management s process to develop the risk ratings of loans and the estimation of economic factors which included the following:

Testing a risk-based targeted selection of loans to evaluate the risk ratings.

Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used for adjustments to the economic factors.

Obtaining management s analysis and supporting documentation related to the economic factors, and testing whether the economic factors
 used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses are supported by the analysis provided by management.

Evaluating the methodology and assumptions used in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses, and testing the calculation
 itself, including completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation, application of the loan risk ratings determined by management and used in the calculation, application of the current economic factors determined by
 management and used in the calculation, and recalculation of the allowance for loan losses balance.

 which they become committed to be released. To the extent that the fair value of the ESOP shares released differs from the cost of such shares, the difference is charged or credited to equity as additional paid in capital. Dividends on
 allocated shares increase participant accounts. Dividends on unallocated shares will be used to repay the loan. At the end of employment, participants will receive shares for their vested balance. Compensation expense related to the ESOP was
