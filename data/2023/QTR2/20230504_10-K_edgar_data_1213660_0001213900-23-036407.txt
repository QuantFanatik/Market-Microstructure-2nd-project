Significant Factors Relating to PRC Government
Oversight of Our Operating Businesses. 

Due to our operations in China, our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political, legal and social conditions
in the PRC or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. There is significant uncertainty
about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and
tariffs. China s economy differs from the economies of other countries in many respects, including with respect to the level of
development, growth rate, amount of government involvement, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While China s
economy has experienced significant growth over the past four decades, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various
economic sectors. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of
resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations
that are currently applicable to us. In addition, in the past the Chinese government implemented certain measures, including interest
rate increases, to manage the pace of economic growth and prevent the economy from overheating. These measures may cause decreased economic
activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Status under Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act 

In December 2021, the SEC adopted rules (the Final
Rules to implement the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the HFCAA ). The HFCAA includes requirements for
the SEC to identify issuers who file annual reports with audit reports issued by independent registered public accounting firms located
in foreign jurisdictions that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
completely because of a position taken by a non-U.S. authority in the accounting firm s jurisdiction Commission-Identified
Issuers ). The HFCAA also requires that, to the extent that the PCAOB has been unable to inspect an issuer s independent registered
public accounting firm for three consecutive years since 2021, the SEC shall prohibit the issuer s securities registered in the
United States from being traded on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter markets in the United States. In December 2022,
the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act amended the HFCAA to shorten the three-year period to two years. 

3 

Under the Final Rules, the SEC adopted submission
and disclosure requirements by amending Form 10-K and other annual reporting forms and established procedures to identify issuers and
prohibit the trading of the securities of certain registrants as required by the HFCAA. Specifically, the Final Rules require each Commission-Identified
Issuer to submit documentation to the SEC annually on or before its annual report due date that establishes that it is not owned or controlled
by a government entity in its public accounting firm s foreign jurisdiction and require additional specified disclosures by foreign
issuers as defined in Rule 3b-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).
The SEC identifies an issuer as a Commission-Identified Issuer after the issuer files its annual report and on a rolling basis, and will
impose an initial trading prohibition on an issuer as soon as practicable after it has been conclusively identified as a Commission-Identified
Issuer for two consecutive years. To end an initial or subsequent trading prohibition, a Commission-Identified Issuer must certify that
it has retained a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB has determined it is able to inspect or investigate. To make that certification,
the Commission-Identified Issuer must file financial statements that include an audit report signed by such a registered public accounting
firm. 

In August 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance of the People s Republic of China, taking
the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland
China and Hong Kong. PCAOB staff members conducted on-site inspections and investigations from September to November 2022, and in December
2022, the PCAOB announced that it has secured complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered
in mainland China and Hong Kong and confirmed that until such time as the PCAOB issues any new determination, there are no Commission-Identified
Issuers at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCAA. 

Given that Audit Alliance LLP, a Singapore based
independent accounting firm, serves as the principal accountant to audit our consolidated financial statements to be filed with the SEC,
we believe we are compliant with the HFCAA, which should preclude a finding by the SEC that we are a Commission-Identified Issuer and
therefore the delisting of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. For a detailed description of risks related to our doing business
in China and status under the HFCAA, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Doing Business in the PRC . 

Recent Regulatory Developments in China 

The PRC government has recently indicated an intent
to exert more oversight and control over securities offerings and other capital markets activities that are conducted outside of China
and over foreign investment in China-based companies. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit or
completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly
decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to
regulate business operations in China, including enforcement actions against illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision
over China-based companies listed outside of China using the variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope
of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. For example, in July 2021, the relevant PRC government
authorities made public the Opinions on Intensifying Crack-Down on Illegal Securities Activities (the Securities Opinions which emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings
by China-based companies and proposed to take measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with
the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the
 CAC released the draft Administrative Regulations on Cyber Data Security for public comments, which requires, among others,
that a prior cybersecurity review should be required for listing abroad of data processors which process over one million users 
personal information, and the listing of data processors in Hong Kong which affects or may affect national security. On February 17, 2023,
the CSRC released the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, and five relevant guidelines, which became effective on March 31, 2023, requiring
the Chinese domestic companies overseas offerings and listings of equity securities be filed with the CSRC. 

4 

The Chinese government may further promulgate
relevant laws, rules and regulations that may impose additional and significant obligations and liabilities on overseas listed PRC companies
regarding data security, cross-border data flow, anti-monopoly and unfair competition, and compliance with China s securities laws.
It is uncertain whether or how these new laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation and implementation thereof may affect us,
but among other things, our ability to obtain external financing through the issuance of equity securities in the United States, Hong
Kong or other markets could be negatively affected, and as a result, the trading prices of our Common Stock could significantly decline
or become worthless. For a detailed description of risks related to our doing business in China, please see the section of this Annual
Report titled Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Doing Business in the PRC. 

Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of
regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas,
adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. For more details,
see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in China Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system
and the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us or result
in a material adverse change to our subsidiaries business operations, and damage our and our subsidiaries reputation, which
would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause our Common Stock to significantly decline
in value or become worthless. 

In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed
enhanced disclosure requirements on China-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. Any future PRC, U.S. or other rules
and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by companies with extensive operations in China could adversely
affect our business and results of operations. Any such action, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors, and could cause the value of our Common Stock to significantly
decline or become worthless. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment,
or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate, our business in China and United States may also
be adversely affected. For more details, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in China Uncertainties
with respect to the PRC legal system and the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections
available to you and us or result in a material adverse change to our subsidiaries business operations, and damage our and our
subsidiaries reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause
our Common Stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

Development of Our Business 

Strategy 

Our strategy is to build a comprehensive healthcare
ecosystem, centering on online and offline healthcare products and services, including retail and wholesale sales of medical devices and
pharmaceuticals, and hospital services. We intend to expand through both organic growth and acquisitions. 

The Boqi Zhengji Acquisition and Subsequent Disposition 

On October 14, 2019, as the initial step in our shift
of focus from the energy sector to the healthcare business, we acquired Boqi Zhengji Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. Boqi Zhengji ),
the operator of a pharmacy chain in the PRC, by purchasing 100 of the equity interests of Lasting Wisdom Holdings Limited Lasting ),
Boqi Zhengji s parent company. Lasting, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Pukung Limited Pukung and Beijing
Xinrongxin Industrial Development Co., Ltd. Xinrongxin ), owned all the ownership interests in Boqi Zhengji. The purchase
price for Boqi Zhengji consisted of RMB 40 million (approximately 5,655,709) and 300,000 shares of Common Stock. The 300,000 shares of
Common Stock were issued to the sellers in October 2019. The cash consideration, which was subject to post-closing adjustments based on
the performance of Boqi Zhengji, measured by its pharmacy club member headcount and gross profit in 2020, was not payable until 2021. 

Shortly after the acquisition, the business of Boqi
Zhengji was severely impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and its revenues plummeted. On December 11, 2020, we entered
into a Termination and Release Agreement (the Release Agreement with the four individuals who sold Boqi Zhengji to us.
We and the sellers confirmed that Boqi Zhengji s performance targets as stipulated in the stock purchase agreement dated April 11,
2019 (as amended on February 6, 2020) would not be met, and therefore the sellers would not be eligible to receive the contingent RMB
40 million cash consideration or any other additional payment. 

On December 11, 2020, we entered into an agreement
to sell all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Boqi Zhengji to a third-party in consideration of 1,700,000 to be paid in
cash at the closing. While the cash consideration was received on December 18, 2020, the official recognition of the closing was not received
until February 2, 2021. 

5 

The NF Group disposition 

In late 2019, we committed to a plan to dispose of
our legacy energy business, NF Energy Savings Corporation and its subsidiaries (the NF Group in order to focus on our
healthcare business. On March 31, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell the NF Group for 10 million to be paid in cash at the closing.
The transaction closed on June 23, 2020, at which time we received 10 million. 

The Guanzan Acquisition 

On February 1, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase
agreement to acquire Chongqing Guanzan Technology Co. Ltd. Guanzan ), a company engaged in the distribution of medical devices
and pharmaceuticals, based in Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest region of the PRC. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to purchase
all the issued and outstanding equity interests in Guanzan and its 80 owned subsidiary, Chongqing Shude Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Shude (together the Guanzan Group for RMB 100,000,000 (approximately 14,285,714) to be paid by the issuance of 19,000 shares
of Common Stock and the cash payment of RMB 80,000,000 (approximately 11,428,571). On March 18, 2020, we closed the Guanzan Group acquisition

If we or our PRC subsidiaries are found to be in
violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits, approvals or filings,
the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures. In addition,
if we had inadvertently concluded that such approvals, permits, registrations or filings were not required, or if applicable laws, regulations
or interpretations change in a way that requires us to obtain such approval, permits, registrations or filings in the future, we and our
PRC subsidiaries may be unable to obtain such necessary approvals, permits, registrations or filings in a timely manner, or at all, and
such approvals, permits, registrations or filings may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance may subject us to fines and
other regulatory, civil or criminal liabilities, and we may be ordered by the competent government authorities to suspend relevant operations,
which will materially and adversely affect our business operations. 

Furthermore, we may be subject to regular inspections,
examinations, inquiries or audits by regulatory authorities, and an adverse outcome of such inspections, examinations, inquiries or audits
may result in the loss or nonrenewal of the relevant licenses and approvals. Moreover, the criteria used in reviewing applications for,
or renewals of licenses and approvals may change from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet new criteria
that may be imposed to obtain or renew the necessary licenses and approvals. Many of such licenses and approvals are material to the operation
of our business, and if we fail to maintain or renew material licenses and approvals, our ability to conduct our business could be materially
impaired and we may be forced to curtail some or all of our operations. If the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations
change, or new regulations come into effect, requiring us or our PRC subsidiaries to obtain any additional permits, licenses or certificates
that were previously not required to operate our business, there can be no assurance that we or our PRC subsidiaries will successfully
obtain such permits, licenses or certificates. 

Cash Transfers and Dividend Distributions 

We are offshore holding company conducting business
through our PRC subsidiaries. In order to fund their operations, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or we may make additional
capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Such loans to our PRC subsidiaries and capital contributions are subject to PRC regulations
and approvals or filings. For example, loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with
SAFE or its local branch. Information about capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries must be filed with the PRC Ministry of Commerce
or its local counterpart. In addition, the PRC government also restricts the convertibility of foreign currencies into Renminbi and use
of the proceeds. According to SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16, the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency
denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that Renminbi capital may not be used for business beyond
its business scope or to provide loans to persons other than affiliates unless otherwise permitted under its business scope. On October
23, 2019, SAFE promulgated Circular 28, which stipulates that non-investment foreign-funded enterprises are allowed to make domestic equity
investment with their capital funds on the premise that the Negative List is not violated and the projects invested thereby in China are
true and compliant. Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set
forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. The Circular Regarding Further Optimizing the Cross-border RMB Policy to Support
the Stabilization of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment jointly promulgated by the PBOC, NDRC, the Ministry of Commerce, the State-owned
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and SAFE
on December 31, 2020 and effective on February 4, 2021 allows the non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic reinvestment
with RMB capital in accordance with the law on the premise that they comply with prevailing regulations and the invested projects in China
are authentic and compliant. In addition, if a foreign-invested enterprise uses RMB income under capital accounts to conduct domestic
reinvestment, the invested enterprise is not required to open a special deposit account for RMB capital. See Item 1A. Risk Factors
- Risks Related to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies to PRC entities
may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. 

The applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules
may significantly limit our ability to convert, transfer and use the net proceeds from the private placement of convertible notes or any
offering of additional equity securities in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As the foreign exchange related regulatory regime and practice are complex and still evolving and involve many uncertainties, we cannot
assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules, or that we will be
able to complete the necessary government registrations or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to
our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations
or filings, our ability to contribute additional capital to fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely
and materially affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.

During the normal course of our business, cash
is transferred between our subsidiaries via wire transfer to and from bank accounts to pay certain business expenses. Cash is maintained
by the parent company BIMI International Medical Inc. in its bank account and transferred to our subsidiaries when necessary. In addition,
cash may be used by BIMI as the holding company to meet corporate expenses such as audit fees, attorneys fees, stock exchange listing
fees, IR/PR expenses and corporate administrative support expenses. In 2022, we transferred 5,600,000 in capital contributions and loans
to our operating subsidiaries in the PRC. As a public company, there are restrictions and limitations on our ability to distribute earnings
to the parent holding company and U.S. investors, depending on various factors such as the company s financial condition, legal
obligations, and applicable regulations. For more information, see Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules for our condensed
consolidating schedule and consolidated financial statements, that are filed as part of the report, beginning on page F-1. 

Our Chinese subsidiaries may pay dividends to the
parent holding company only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.
PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds
from future financing activities to make loans or additional capital contributions to subsidiaries in the PRC or Hong Kong. See Item
1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies
to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. 

We have never declared or paid any dividends on our
shares or any other securities. In order for us to distribute dividends to our shareholders, we will need to rely to some extent on dividends
distributed by our PRC subsidiaries. PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us, and such
distributions will be subject to PRC withholding tax. In addition, PRC regulations currently permit payment of dividends by a PRC company
only out of accumulated distributable after-tax profits, as determined in accordance the accounting standards and regulations in the PRC.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Shares - Because we have not paid dividends and have no present intention of paying
dividends, investors will not realize any income from an investment in our Common Stock unless and until investors sell their shares at
profit. 

If any of our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their
own behalf, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Under PRC
laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance
with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10 of
its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund
reaches 50 of its registered capital. Such reserve funds cannot be distributed to us as dividends. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned
enterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to an enterprise expansion fund, or a staff
welfare and bonus fund. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the
PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary. 

Nevertheless, to the extent cash or assets are located
in the PRC or Hong Kong, or in a PRC or Hong Kong entity, the funds or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use
outside the PRC or Hong Kong due to the intervention, or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on our ability or that of our
subsidiaries in the PRC or Hong Kong, by the PRC government to transfer cash or assets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related
to Doing Business in China - PRC regulations on loans and direct investments by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or
prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. 

14 

Our PRC subsidiaries generate primarily all of their
revenue in RMB, which is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the
ability of our PRC subsidiaries to use their RMB revenues to pay dividends to us. However, conversion of RMB to other currencies are permitted
for the purpose of dividends according to the PRC s regulations on Foreign Exchange Control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors -
Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. 

Further, in response to the persistent capital outflow
in the PRC and RMB s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People s Bank of China PBOC)
and China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) promulgated a series of capital control measures, including stricter
vetting procedures for domestic companies to remit foreign currency for overseas investments, dividends payments and shareholder loan
repayments. Such measures were relaxed in mid-2017 with the slowdown of the capital outflow and stabilizing of the RMB. However, the PRC
government may revert to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward by
the SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of
our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow,
make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the EIT
Law and its implementation rules provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary
to its equity holders that are non-PRC resident enterprises, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10 , unless
any such foreign investor s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a reduced withholding rate
arrangement and such non-PRC resident enterprises constitute the beneficiary of such income. 

Pursuant to an arrangement between Mainland China
and Hong Kong (the Hong Kong Tax Treaty and relevant tax regulations of the PRC, subject to certain conditions, a reduced
withholding tax rate of 5 will be available for dividends from PRC entities provided that the recipient can demonstrate it is a Hong
Kong tax resident and it is the beneficial owner of the dividends. The government adopted regulations in 2018 which stipulate that in
determining whether a non-resident enterprise has the status as a beneficial owner, comprehensive analysis shall be conducted based on
the factors listed therein and the actual circumstances of the specific case shall be taken into consideration. Specifically, it expressly
excludes an agent or a designated payee from being considered as a beneficial owner. 

Cash Management Policies and
Procedures 

Under our informal cash management policy, the frequency and amount
of intercompany transfers of funds is determined based on the working capital needs of our subsidiaries and intercompany transactions
and is subject to internal approval processes and funding arrangements. Our management reviews and monitors our cash flow forecast and
working capital needs of our subsidiaries on a regular basis. In addition, capital contributions and intercompany loan arrangements are
subject to local jurisdiction and banking regulations. In this regard, we have not faced difficulties or limitations in our ability to
transfer cash between subsidiaries in any of our operating jurisdictions. BIMI Medical International Inc, our Delaware holding company,
has been able to transfer funds to its subsidiaries, but the subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to BIMI Medical International
Inc. 

On June 9, 2022, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the
Chairman of the Board of the Company, Mr. Fnu Oudom, whereby Mr. Oudom agreed to purchase 1,250,000 (post a 1-for-10 reverse split in
December 2022) shares of Common Stock for 5 million, or 0.40 per share, which was subject to the approval of the shareholders of the
Company. Upon approval, the 5 million was transferred to our PRC subsidiaries for working capital purposes. The transfer of funds among
our operating PRC subsidiaries is subject to the Provisions of the Supreme People s Court on Several Issues Concerning the Application
of Law in the Trial of Private Lending Cases (2020 Revision, the Provisions on Private Lending Cases ), which was implemented
on August 20, 2020 to regulate the financing activities between natural persons, legal persons and unincorporated organizations. The Provisions
on Private Lending Cases does not prohibit using cash generated from one subsidiary to fund another subsidiary s operations. To
date, none of our subsidiaries have made any distributions or paid any dividend to Bimi Medical International Inc. We have not been notified
of any other restriction which could limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to transfer cash between subsidiaries. See Item 15 
 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules for our condensed consolidated financial statements, that are filed as part of
this report, beginning on page F-1.

Regulation of Foreign Investments 

The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC Foreign
Investment Law was formally adopted by the National People s Congress on March 15, 2019 and became effective on January
1, 2020. The Foreign Investment Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the
legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry
national treatment and are subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given
to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment access is not lower than that of domestic investors and their investments.
The negative list management system means that the state implements special administrative procedures for access of foreign investment
in specific fields. Foreign investors shall not invest in any forbidden fields stipulated in the negative list and shall meet the conditions
stipulated in the negative list before investing in any restricted fields. 

Foreign investors investment, earnings and
other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China are protected in accordance with the law, and all national policies
on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. The state guarantees that foreign-invested
enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner. The state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate
in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. The State shall not expropriate any foreign
investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy or expropriate the investment of foreign investors
in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with
legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises
shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection, social insurance, tax, accounting, foreign exchange and other matters stipulated
in laws and regulations. 

On December 19, 2020, the NDRC and the MOFCOM jointly
promulgated the Measures on the Security Review of Foreign Investment, effective on January 18, 2021, which sets forth provisions concerning
the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject to review, review scopes and procedures,
among others. The Office of the Working Mechanism of the Security Review of Foreign Investment (the Office of the Working Mechanism will be established under the NDRC to carry out routine work of security review on foreign investment. Foreign investor or relevant parties
in China must declare the security review to the Office of the Working Mechanism prior to (i) the investments in the military industry,
military industrial supporting industry and other fields relating to the security of national defense, and investments in areas surrounding
military facilities and military industry facilities; and (ii) investments in important agricultural products, important energy and resources,
important equipment manufacturing, important infrastructure, important transport services, important cultural products and services, important
information technology and internet products and services, important financial services, key technologies and other important fields relating
to national security, and obtain control in the target enterprise. Control exists when the foreign investor (i) holds over 50 equity
interests in the target, (ii) has voting rights that can materially impact on the resolutions of the board of directors or shareholders
meeting of the target even when it holds less than 50 equity interests in the target, or (iii) has material impact on the target s
business decisions, human resources, accounting and technology, etc. 

On December 26, 2019, the State Council promulgated
the Implementation Regulations on the Foreign Investment Law , which came into effect on January 1, 2020, and it further requires
that foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises shall be treated equally with respect to policy making and implementation.
Pursuant to the Implementation Regulations on the Foreign Investment Law , if the existing foreign-invested enterprises fail
to change their original forms as of January 1, 2025, the relevant market regulation departments will not process other registration matters
for the enterprises and may disclose their relevant information to the public. 

On December 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the State Administration
for Market Regulation jointly issued the Measures for Reporting of Foreign Investment Information , or the Foreign Investment
Information Measures, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the Interim Administrative Measures for the Record-filing
of the Establishment and Modification of Foreign-invested Enterprises . Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment
activities directly or indirectly in the PRC, foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information through
the Enterprise Registration System and the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System operated by the State Administration
for Market Regulation. Foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall disclose their investment information by submitting reports
for their establishments, modifications and cancelations and their annual reports in accordance with the Foreign Investment Information
Measures. If a foreign-invested enterprise investing in the PRC has finished submitting its reports for its establishment, modifications
and cancelation and its annual reports, the relevant information will be shared by the competent market regulation department to the competent
commercial department, and does not require such foreign-invested enterprise to submit the reports separately.

Regulation of Overseas Securities
Offerings 

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC issued the Trial Administrative Measures
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Trial Administrative Measures and relevant supporting
guidelines (collectively, the New Administrative Rules Regarding Overseas Listings ), which came into force on March 31,
2023. According to the New Administrative Rules Regarding Overseas Listings, among other things, a domestic company in the PRC that seeks
to offer and list securities in overseas markets must fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial
Administrative Measures. Initial public offerings or listings in overseas markets must file with the CSRC within three (3) working days
after the relevant application is submitted overseas. If an issuer offers securities in the same overseas market where it has previously
offered and listed securities subsequently, filings have to be made with the CSRC within three (3) working days after the offering is
completed. Upon occurrence of any material event, such as change of control, investigations or sanctions imposed by an overseas securities 
regulatory agency or other relevant competent authority, change of listing status or transfer of listing segment, or voluntary or mandatory
delisting, after an issuer has offered and listed securities in an overseas market, the issuer must submit a report thereof to CSRC within
three (3) working days after the occurrence and public disclosure of such event. On February 24, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Provisions
on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Confidentiality
and Archives Administration Provisions ), which also became effective on March 31, 2023. The Confidentiality and Archives Administration
Provisions set out rules, requirements and procedures relating to provision of documents, materials and accounting archives for securities
companies, securities service providers, overseas regulators and other entities and individuals in connection with overseas offering and
listing, including without limitation to, domestic companies that carry out overseas offering and listing (either in direct or indirect
means) and the securities companies and securities service providers (either incorporated domestically or overseas) that undertake relevant
businesses shall not leak any state secret and working secret of government agencies, or harm national security and public interest, and
a domestic company shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy administrative department
at the same level, if it plans to, either directly or through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide any documents and
materials that contain state secrets or working secrets of government agencies. Working papers produced in the Chinese mainland by securities
companies and securities service providers in the process of undertaking businesses related to overseas offering and listing by domestic
companies shall be retained in the Chinese mainland. Where such documents need to be transferred or transmitted to outside the Chinese
mainland, relevant approval procedures stipulated by regulations shall be followed. While we believe we do not involve leaking any state
secret and working secret of government agencies, or harming national security and public interest in connection with provision of documents,
materials and accounting archives, there is uncertainty how the new provisions will be interpreted and implemented in the future, and
we may be required to perform additional procedures in connection with the provision of accounting archives after the Confidentiality
and Archives Administration Provisions come into effect. Any failure by us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Common Stock or our other securities, cause significant disruption
to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
and cause our Common Stock or such other securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

Regulation of Mergers and Acquisitions 

PRC regulations and rules concerning mergers and
acquisitions, including the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (the M A Rules ),
and other regulations and rules with respect to mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could
make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M A Rules require that
the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign
investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors
that have or may have impact on the national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic
enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the PRC, which was
amended in June 2022 and became effective as of August 1, 2022, and the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations
of Undertakings issued by the State Council, the concentration of business undertakings by way of mergers, acquisitions or contractual
arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must also be notified
in advance to the State Administration for Market Regulation (the SAMR when the threshold is crossed and such concentration
shall not be implemented without the clearance of prior notification. In addition, the Measures for Security Review of Foreign Investment
jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and MOFCOM and the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System
for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprise by Foreign Investors (the Security Review Rules issued by the MOFCOM
specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers
and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire the de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national
security concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security
review by structuring the transaction through, among other things, trusts, entrustment or contractual control arrangements. 

Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned
regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes may delay
or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether our business would be deemed to be in an industry that
raises national defense and security or national security concerns. However, MOFCOM and other government agencies
may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which case our
future acquisitions in the PRC may be closely scrutinized or prohibited. Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our
market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected. 

17 

Annual Inspections 

In accordance with relevant PRC laws, all types
of enterprises incorporated under PRC laws are subject to annual inspections with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
of the PRC or its local branches. In addition, foreign invested enterprises are subject to annual inspections conducted by other applicable
PRC governmental authorities. In order to reduce enterprises burden of submitting inspection documentation to different governmental
authorities, the Measures on Implementing Joint Annual Inspection on Foreign-invested Enterprises issued in 1998 by State Administration
of Foreign Exchange SAFE ), together with six other ministries, stipulated that foreign-invested enterprises must participate
in an annual inspection jointly conducted by all relevant PRC governmental authorities. 

Foreign Currency Exchange
Regulations . 

Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration
Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 2008 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce SAIC and the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities, Renminbi are freely convertible only to the extent of current account items,
such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans
and repatriation of investment, require prior approval from SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency,
such as US dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC. 

Payments for transactions that take place within
the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies must repatriate foreign currency payments received from abroad.
Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks subject to a cap set by SAFE
or its local counterpart. Unless otherwise approved, domestic enterprises must convert all of their foreign currency receipts into Renminbi.
On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated a circular regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its registered capital in
foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. This circular stipulates that the registered capital
of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business
scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. Violations of this circular
can result in severe penalties, including monetary fines. 

In addition, any foreign loans to an operating subsidiary
in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its approved total investment
amount and its approved registered capital amount. 

Regulation of Foreign Exchange
in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions 

In October 2005, SAFE issued Circular 75, which
regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of a special purpose vehicles by PRC residents to seek offshore
equity financing and conduct return investment in China. Under Circular 75, a special purpose vehicles refers
to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC citizens or PRC entities (collectively, as PRC residents)
for the purpose of seeking offshore equity financing using assets or interests owned by such PRC residents or PRC entities in onshore
companies, while round trip investment refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents through the use of special
purpose vehicles, including without limitation, establishing foreign invested enterprises and using such foreign invested enterprises
to purchase or control (by way of contractual arrangements) onshore assets. Circular 75 requires that, before establishing or controlling
a special purpose vehicles, PRC residents are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the competent local
counterparts of SAFE for their overseas investments. In addition, such PRC resident is required to amend his or her SAFE registration
or to file with SAFE or its competent local branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose vehicles in connection with any increase
or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets
located in China by the offshore special purpose vehicles. To further clarify the implementation of such amendment or filing procedure,
SAFE requires domestic enterprises under Circular 75 to coordinate and supervise such amendment or filings with SAFE or its local counterparts
by such PRC residents. If PRC residents fail to comply, the domestic enterprises are required to report to the local SAFE authorities. 

18 

Failure to comply with the registration procedures
set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company,
including being prohibited from distributing its profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to
its offshore parent or affiliate, and restrictions on the ability to contribute additional capital from the offshore entity to the PRC
entities, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. 

Regulation of Overseas Listing 

Recent statements by the PRC government have
indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China-based
issuers. The PRC government recently initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation
of business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing
supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the
scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. On February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (the CSRC issued the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies (the Trial Administrative Measures and relevant supporting guidelines (collectively, the New Administrative
Rules Regarding Overseas Listings ), which came into force on March 31, 2023. According to the New Administrative Rules Regarding
Overseas Listings, among other things, a domestic company in the PRC that seeks to offer and list securities in overseas markets shall
fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC as per requirement of the Trial Administrative Measures. According to the Trial Administrative
Measures, Article 2, where a domestic company seeks to directly offer and list securities in overseas markets, the issuer shall file
with the CSRC and where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in overseas markets, the issuer shall designate
a major domestic operating entity, which shall, as the domestic responsible entity, file with the CSRC. Initial public offerings or listings
in overseas markets shall be filed with the CSRC within three (3) working days after the relevant application is submitted overseas.
If an issuer offers securities in the same overseas market where it has previously offered and listed securities subsequently, filings
shall be made with the CSRC within three (3) working days after the offering is completed. According to the Trial Administrative Measures
Article 22, upon occurrence of any material event, such as change of control, investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities
regulatory agencies or other relevant competent authorities, change of listing status or transfer of listing segment, or voluntary or
mandatory delisting, after an issuer has offered and listed securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit a report thereof
to CSRC within three (3) working days after the occurrence and public disclosure of such event. Further, according to the Trial Administrative
Measures Article 21, an overseas securities company that serves as a sponsor or lead underwriter for overseas securities offering and
listing by domestic companies shall file with the CSRC within 10 working days after signing its first engagement agreement for such business,
and submit to the CSRC, no later than January 31 each year, an annual report on its business activities in the previous year associated
with overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies. If an overseas securities company has entered into engagement agreements
before the effectuation of the Trial Administrative Measures and is serving in practice as a sponsor or lead underwriter for overseas
securities offering and listing by domestic companies, it shall file with the CSRC within 30 working days after the Trial Administrative
Measures take effect. On February 24, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions ),
which also became effective on March 31, 2023. The Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions set out rules, requirements
and procedures relating to provision of documents, materials and accounting archives for securities companies, securities service providers,
overseas regulators and other entities and individuals in connection with overseas offering and listing, including without limitation
to, domestic companies that carry out overseas offering and listing (either in direct or indirect means) and the securities companies
and securities service providers (either incorporated domestically or overseas) that undertake relevant businesses shall not leak any
state secret and working secret of government agencies, or harm national security and public interest, and a domestic company shall first
obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same level, if
it plans to, either directly or through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide any documents and materials that contain
state secrets or working secrets of government agencies. Working papers produced in the Chinese mainland by securities companies and
securities service providers in the process of undertaking businesses related to overseas offering and listing by domestic companies
shall be retained in the Chinese mainland. Where such documents need to be transferred or transmitted to outside the Chinese mainland,
relevant approval procedures stipulated by regulations shall be followed. While we believe we do not involve leaking any state secret
and working secret of government agencies, or harming national security and public interest in connection with provision of documents,
materials and accounting archives, there is uncertainty how the new provisions will be interpreted and implemented in the future, and
we may be required to perform additional procedures in connection with the provision of accounting archives after the Confidentiality
and Archives Administration Provisions come into effect. Any failure by us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Common Stock or our other securities, cause significant disruption
to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
and cause our Common Stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless.

Anti-Monopoly Regulations

The Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by
the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress which became effective on August 1, 2008 and the Interim Provisions
on the Review of Concentrations of Undertakings promulgated by the SAMR which became effective on December 1, 2020 require that
transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by the SAMR before
they can be completed. Where the participation in concentration of undertakings by way of foreign-funded merger and acquisition of domestic
enterprises or any other method which involves national security, the examination of concentration of undertakings shall be carried out
pursuant to the provisions of this law and examination of national security shall be carried out pursuant to the relevant provisions
of the state. Failure to comply with above regulations may result in an order to stop concentration, dispose the shares/assets or transfer
the operation within a stipulated period, or adopt other necessary measures to reinstate the preconcentration status, or fines. 

On October 23, 2021, the SCNPC issued a draft
of the amended Anti-Monopoly Law for public comments. On June 24, 2022, the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National
People s Congress on Revising the Anti-monopoly Law of the People s Republic of China , or the Revised Anti-monopoly Law
was released, which will be effective on August 1, 2022. According to the Revised Anti-monopoly Law, the fines for illegal concentration
of business operators have been increased to no more than ten percent of its last year s sales revenue if the concentration of
business operator has or may have an effect of excluding or limiting competitions; or a fine of up to RMB5 million if the concentration
of business operator does not have an effect of excluding or limiting competition. The Revised Anti-monopoly Law also stipulates that
the relevant authority shall investigate a transaction where there is any evidence that the concentration has or may have the effect
of eliminating or restricting competitions, even if such concentration does not reach the filing threshold. And in order to adapt the
Revised Anti-monopoly Law, on June 27, 2022, the SAMR issued a Discussion Draft of the Provisions on Prohibition of the Abuse
of Market Dominance . As of the date of this annual report, the Discussion Draft of the Provisions on Prohibition of the Abuse of
Market Dominance was released for public comments only and the final version and effective date of such regulations are subject to substantial
uncertainty. 

Cybersecurity Regulations 

On December 28, 2021, the Chinese government promulgated
Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February 15, 2022. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the procurement
of any network product or service by an operator of critical information infrastructure or the conducting of data processing activities
by a network platform operator, that affects or may affect national security, will be subject to a cybersecurity review. A network platform
operator that possesses personal information of more than one million users must apply to the Cybersecurity Review Office set up under
the CAC for a cybersecurity review when it seeks to list overseas. 

As of the date of this report, based on the advice of our PRC counsel,
Chongqing Jinmujinyang (Jiulongpo) Law Firm (a/k/a in English: Chongqing Kingmoon Kingyang (Jiulongpo) Law Firm), we do not believe
that we or any of our subsidiaries are covered by the permission requirements from the CAC nor do we expect that the current PRC laws
on cybersecurity or data security will have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, as there remains significant
uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we could be subject to cybersecurity
review, and if so, we may not be able to pass such review. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations
launched by PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance
with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including suspension of business, website closure, removal
of our app from the relevant app stores, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings
or actions against us, which may have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of the
date of this report, we have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the Cyber Administration of
China or related governmental regulatory authorities, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanction in such respect.
We believe that we are in compliance with the aforementioned regulations and policies that have been issued by the Cyber Administration
of China.

Regulations Relating to Taxation 

The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies a 25 
enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except to the extent tax incentives are granted
to special industries and projects. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation regulations, dividends generated from
the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008 and payable to its foreign investor may be subject to a withholding tax rate of
10 if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a non-resident enterprise, unless there is a tax treaty with China
that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008 are exempt from PRC
withholding tax. 

Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise
established outside China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise 
for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25 enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income.
A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation in April 2009 regarding the standards used to classify certain Chinese-invested
enterprises controlled by Chinese enterprises or Chinese enterprise groups and established outside of China as resident enterprises 
clarified that dividends and other income paid by such PRC resident enterprises will be considered PRC-source income and
subject to PRC withholding tax, currently at a rate of 10 , when paid to non-PRC enterprise shareholders. This circular also subjects
such PRC resident enterprises to various reporting requirements with the PRC tax authorities. 

Under the implementation regulations to the PRC
Enterprise Income Tax Law, a de facto management body is defined as a body that has material and overall management and
control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition,
the tax circular mentioned above specifies that certain PRC invested overseas enterprises controlled by a Chinese enterprise or a Chinese
enterprise group in the PRC will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if the following are located or resident in the PRC: senior
management personnel and departments that are responsible for daily production, operation and management; financial and personnel decision
making bodies; key properties, accounting books, the company seal, and minutes of board meetings and shareholders meetings; and
50 or more of the senior management or directors having voting rights. 

Pharmaceutical and Ancillary
Regulations 

According to the Administrative Measures
for Pharmaceutical Business Licenses and other relevant regulations in China, we need to obtain qualification certificates the
operations of our Company, including all of our subsidiaries and pharmacy stores in China. The qualification certificates mainly include
the Quality Management Certificate for Pharmaceutical Administration (GSP Certificate) and the Pharmaceutical Business
License . Food Business License , Medical Device Business License , Medical Agency Practice License ,
etc. 

All of our pharmacies have obtained Pharmaceutical
Business Licenses and Pharmaceutical Management Quality Management Certificates In addition, all of our pharmacies have obtained Internet
Drug Information Service Qualification Certificates and Medical Device Network Sales Records These business qualifications, which are
necessary for operating pharmacies in China, are subject to annual renewal. 

A distributor of pharmaceutical products must obtain
a distribution permit from the relevant provincial or designated municipal or county level Food and Drug Administration. The grant of
such permit is subject to an inspection of the distributor s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems,
personnel, and equipment. The distribution permit is valid for five (5) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the permit within
six (6) months prior to its expiration. In addition, a pharmaceutical product distributor needs to obtain a business license from the
relevant administration for industry and commerce prior to commencing its business. All of our retail pharmacies have obtained necessary
pharmaceutical distribution permits, and we do not expect to face any difficulties in renewing these permits and/or certifications. 

21 

In addition, under the Supervision and Administration
Rules on Pharmaceutical Product Distribution , promulgated by the SFDA, a pharmaceutical product distributor is responsible for its
procurement and sales activities and is liable for the actions of its employees or agents in connection with their conduct of distribution
on behalf of the distributor. A retail distributor of pharmaceutical products is not allowed to sell prescription pharmaceutical products
or Tier A OTC pharmaceutical products listed in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs without a valid prescription or
the presence of a certified in-store pharmacist. See Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program. 

A distributor of nutritional supplements and other
food products must obtain a food circulation permit from its local Administration of Industry and Commerce. The grant of such permit
is subject to an inspection of the distributor s facilities, warehouses, hygienic environment, quality control systems, personnel,
and equipment. The food circulation permit is valid for three (3) years, and the holder must apply for renewal of the certificate within
thirty (30) days prior to its expiration. The Guanzan Group has received this permit for its operation. 

GSP standards regulate wholesale and retail pharmaceutical
product distributors to ensure the quality of distribution of pharmaceutical products in China. All wholesale and retail pharmaceutical
product distributors are required to apply for GSP certification within thirty (30) days after obtaining drug distribution permits. The
current applicable GSP standards require pharmaceutical product distributors to implement strict controls on the distribution of pharmaceutical
products, including standards regarding staff qualifications, distribution premises, warehouses, inspection equipment and facilities,
management, and quality control. Specifically, the warehouse must be able to store the pharmaceutical products at various required temperatures
and humidity, and handle transport, warehouse entries, delivery, and billing by computerized logistics management systems. The GSP certificate
is usually valid for five (5) years. Currently, Guanzan Group is a GSP certified company. 

Under the Rules on Administration of Prescriptions promulgated
by the SFDA, doctors are required to include the chemical ingredients of the medicine they prescribe in their prescription and are not
allowed to include brand names in their prescription. This regulation is designed to provide consumers with choices among different pharmaceutical
products that contain the same chemical ingredients. 

Eligible participants in the national medical insurance
program, consisting primarily of urban residents, are entitled to purchase medicine when presenting their medical insurance cards in
an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicine they purchase has been included in the national or provincial medical insurance catalogs.
Depending on relevant local regulations, authorized pharmacies can either (i) sell medicine on credit and obtain reimbursement from relevant
government social security bureaus on a monthly basis, or (ii) receive payments from the participants at the time of their purchases,
and the participants in turn obtain reimbursement from relevant government social security bureaus. 

Medications included in the national and provincial
medical insurance catalogs are divided into two (2) tiers. Purchases of Tier A pharmaceutical products are generally fully reimbursable.
Purchasers of Tier B pharmaceutical products, which are generally more expensive than those in Tier A, are required to make a certain
percentage of co-payments, with the remaining amount being reimbursable. The percentage of reimbursement for Tier B OTC products varies
in different regions in the PRC. Factors that affect the inclusion of medicine in the medical insurance catalogs include whether the
medicine is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in China and whether it is considered to be important
in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public. 

22 

China s Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
together with other government authorities, have the power to determine which medicines are included in the national medical insurance
catalog every two (2) years, under which of the two (2) tiers the included medicine falls, and whether an included medicine should be
removed from the catalog. 

Advertising Regulation 

Under the Advertising Law of the PRC, the contents
of an advertisement must be true, lawful, without falsehood, and must neither deceive nor mislead consumers. Accordingly, advertisements
must be examined by the competent authority prior to its publication or broadcast through any form of media. In addition, advertisements
of pharmaceutical products may only be based on a drug s approved indication of use statement and may not contain any assurance
of a product s efficiency, treatment efficiency, curative rate, or any other information prohibited by law. Advertisement for certain
drugs should include an admonishment to seek a doctor s advice before purchasing and application. Advertising is prohibited for
certain drugs such as anesthetics and psychotropic drugs. 

To further prevent misleading advertising of pharmaceutical
products, the SAIC and the SFDA jointly promulgated the Standards for Examination and Publication of Advertisements of Pharmaceutical
Products and Measures for Examination of Advertisement of Pharmaceutical Products in March 2007. Under these regulations, an approval
must be obtained from the provincial level of food and drug administration before a pharmaceutical product may be advertised. In addition,
once approved, an advertisement s content may not be altered without further approval. Such approval, once obtained, is valid for
one (1) year. 

Regulation of Medical Institutions 

We started to operate in and have been subject to
regulations relating to the management of medical institutions upon completion of the acquisition of Guoyitang in January 2021. The Administrative
Measures on Medical Institutions, as amended, provides that the establishment of a medical institution by any entity or individual must
be reviewed and approved by health administrative departments at or above the county level and obtain a Medical Institution Practicing
Certificate.

Medical Institutions (For Trial Implementation) provides that the Medical Institution Practicing Certificate is subject to periodic examinations
and verifications by registration authorities. The verification period is 3 years for general hospitals, hospitals of traditional Chinese
medicine, hospitals of western medicine, hospitals of ethnic minority medicine and specialized hospitals, as well as sanitariums, rehabilitation
hospitals, maternity and children s health care centers, emergency centers, clinical laboratories and specialized disease prevention
institutions equipped with more than 100 beds, while the verification period is 1 year for other medical institutions. In the event that
a medical institution fails to apply for verification as required and post re-verification procedures or unsuccessful in its re-verification
application, the registration authorities may cancel its Medical Institution Practicing Certificate.

and other departments and medical staff members of medical institutions are forbidden to purchase drugs on their own. 

Regulations on Employment
and Social Welfare 

According to the Labor Contract Law of the
People s Republic of China , or the Labor Contract Law, promulgated by the SCNPC on June 29, 2007 and amended on December 28,
2012, and the Implementation Rules of the Labor Contract Law of the People s Republic of China , or the Implementation
Rules of the Labor Contract Law, promulgated by the State Council on September 18, 2008, a written employment contract shall be concluded
in the establishment of an employment relationship. If an employer fails to enter into a written employment contract with an employee

into a written employment contract with the employee and pay the employee twice the employee s salary for the period from the day
following the lapse of one month from the date of establishment of the employment relationship to the day prior to the execution of the
written employment contract. The Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules also require compensation to be paid upon certain terminations.
In addition, if an employer intends to enforce a noncompete provision in an employment contract or noncompetition agreement with an employee,
it has to compensate the employee on a monthly basis during the term of the restriction period after the termination or expiry of the
labor contract. Employers in most cases are also required to provide severance payment to their employees after their employment relationships
are terminated. 

Pursuant to the Social Insurance Law of
the People s Republic of China , which was promulgated by the SCNPC on October 28, 2010, effective on July 1, 2011 and last

the plans or funds in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of the employees as specified
by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their businesses or where they are located. 

24 

Marketing and Promotion 

Our current marketing and promotion efforts are
focused on our wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and retail pharmacy operations, and our strategy is to build brand
recognition, build strong customer loyalty, and develop incremental revenue opportunities. 

For our wholesale business, we promote our products
and brand through participation in trade shows and academic seminars and engaging third party professionals in advertisement efforts.
We actively pursue direct sales to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies as well government centralized procurement and bidding projects. 

In our retail stores, the store managers and staff
are encouraged to propose their own advertising and promotional plans, including holiday promotions, posters and billboards. In addition,
we periodically offer special discounts and gift promotions for selected merchandise in conjunction with our suppliers marketing
programs. We intend to invest in advertising in 2023.We also provide ancillary services such as providing free blood pressure readings
in our stores. 

Many of our promotional programs are designed to
encourage manufacturers to invest resources to market their brands within our stores. We charge manufacturers promotional fees in exchange
for the right to promote their products during promotional periods. Since manufacturers provide purchasing incentives and information
to help customers make informed purchase decisions, we believe that manufacturer led promotions improve our customers shopping
experience. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

The Company s medical devices and pharmaceutical
suppliers include national and regional large-scale pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing companies and wholesale pharmaceutical
companies. 

We believe that competitive sources are readily
available for substantially all of the products we require for our retail and wholesale businesses. As such, we believe that we can change
suppliers without any material interruption to our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in sourcing
our suppliers. 

In the year ended December 31, 2022, no vendor accounted
for more than 10 of our wholesale medical devices purchases and one vendor accounted for 42.0 of our wholesale pharmaceutical purchases. 

Quality Control 

We strongly emphasize quality control, which starts
with procurement. In addition to their market acceptance and costs, we select products based on Good Manufacturing Practice and Good
Supply Practices GSP compliance by our suppliers. We also assess product quality based on the manufacturer s facilities
and capabilities, including technology, packaging and logistics. We conduct random quality inspections of each batch of products we procure
and replace any supplier who fails to pass such inspections. 

25 

In addition to general quality control measures
described above, we also enforce strict quality control measures at our storage and distribution center. All products for our wholesale
and retail businesses are screened upon their arrival, and those with evidence of defects or damages are immediately rejected. Products
that pass the screening process are recorded and stored strictly according to each manufacturer s temperature and other requirements.
Products (for both our pharmacies and wholesale customers) are verified against the appropriate delivery orders prior to leaving the
facility. We use vehicles with cold-temperature storage to make deliveries as necessary. 

Competition 

Guanzan and Shude, our distributors of medical devices
and pharmaceuticals, have established distribution channels in the city of Chongqing, China. The wholesale medical devices and pharmaceutical
distribution industries in China are competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with regional distributors as well as national operators.
These competitors have substantially greater logistics capacities and more financial resources, as well as more industry relevant experience,
than us. 

The pharmacy industry in China is also intensely
competitive, rapidly evolving and highly fragmented. We compete on the basis of store location, merchandise selection, prices and brand
recognition. Many of our competitors include large, national drugstore chains that may have more financial resources, stronger brand
strength, and management expertise than us. Other competitors include local and independent drugstores and government operated pharmacies,
as well as discount stores, convenience stores, and supermarkets with respect to sundry and other non-medicinal products that we carry. 

We plan to focus on on-line initiated sales in the
future based on the use of apps and expect to compete against established state-owned pharmacies and internet giants. No assurance can
be given that we will succeed in this initiative. 

The medical services market in China is highly competitive
and fragmented with numerous market participants. Our competitors include major privately-owned multi-site operators in China. We believe
the principal competitive factors in this market are price and quality of service, variety of services rendered, convenience and proximity
of treatment center location to place of business or residence, brand recognition and reputation, targeted marketing and customized services.
We also face intense competition in our general healthcare service business. We compete primarily with other treatment centers in our
areas of operation. Key competitive factors include healthcare service quality, reputation, convenience and price. We expect new competitors
in the general healthcare service industry will continue to emerge given the state of China healthcare reform and the central and local
governments supportive policies towards public healthcare reform and private capital investment in the healthcare services industry.
The Company is also actively seeking potential partnerships. 

26 

Seasonality 

Our management believes that our operations are
not currently subject to seasonal influences. 

Employees 

We consider our employees the most valuable
asset of our company. We offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits to attract and retain our employees. We believe
that an engaged workforce is key to maintaining our ability to innovate. We invest in our employees career growth and
development is an important focus for us. We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees in compliance with
applicable regulations. We have taken necessary precautions in response to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, including offering
employees the flexibility to work from home and mandatory social distancing requirements in the workplace. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 296 full-time
employees working in the PRC and two employees in the U.S., including 200 employees working in hospitals, of which 6 are engaged in information
technology. As of December 31, 2022 the number of employees employed in the retail pharmacy, wholesale medical devices wholesale pharmaceuticals.
medical service and other were 11, 85, 194 and 6, respectively. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.

27 

We
 have had a history of losses and our ability to grow sales and achieve profitability are
 unpredictable. 

We
 have a substantial amount of existing debt, which may restrict our financing and operating

 recent COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our business operations, results
 of operations, cash flows and financial position during 2022. 

Breaches
 of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. 

If
 we fail to implement effective internal controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
 or remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify, such failure
 could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose
 confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading
 price of our Common Stock. 

Violations
 of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws to which we are subject
 could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position, and
 results of operations. 

Risks Relating to Our Wholesale Operations 

Failure
 to maintain relationships with our customers or to otherwise expand our distribution network
 would materially and adversely affect our business. 

28 

Our
 wholesale pharmaceutical business operates without the support of manufacturing capability
 and is at a significant disadvantage. 

Risks Relating to Our Pharmacy Business 

We
 may be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the applicable PRC laws and
 regulations governing sales of medicines under China s National Medical Insurance Program. 

We
 may not be able to maintain proper inventory levels for our pharmacy stores. 

Certain
 risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services and we do not maintain professional liability
 and errors and omissions liability insurance. 

Risks Related to Our Hospitals 

Our hospitals historically derived a significant portion of their revenue
by providing healthcare services to patients with public medical insurance coverage; any delayed payment under China s public medical
insurance programs could affect our results of operations. 

Our hospital could become the subject of patient complaints, claims
and legal proceedings in the course of its operations, which could result in costs and materially and adversely affect our brand image,
reputation and results of operations. 

If we fail to properly manage the employment of the physicians and
other medical professionals of our hospital, we may be subject to penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business
and results of operations. 

Our
 performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain skilled physicians. 

As
 a provider of medical services, we are exposed to inherent risks relating to malpractice
 claims. 

Regulatory
pricing controls may affect the pricing of our hospital. 

Risks Related to Our Human Capital 

We
 may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified workforce, including key management. 

We
 substantially depend on a few key personnel who, if not retained, could cause declines in
 productivity and operational results and loss of our strategic guidance, all of which would
 diminish our business prospects and value to investors. 

29 

Risk Related to Doing Business in China 

Changes
 in the political and economic policies of the PRC government or in relations between China
 and the United States or other governments may materially and adversely affect our business,
 financial condition, and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain
 our growth and expansion strategies. 

Adverse
 changes in economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse
 effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\ 

Our
 shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB is
 unable to inspect our auditors for two consecutive years. 

The
 approval of, or filing or other procedures with, the CSRC or other Chinese regulatory authorities
 may be required in connection with issuing our equity securities to foreign investors under
 Chinese law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able, or how long it
 will take us, to obtain such approval or complete such filing or other procedures. 

If
 we do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive patient, customer and business information,
 we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to
 litigation; We may become subject to cybersecurity review. 

The
 impact of China s regulatory reforms is unpredictable. 

The
 PRC government s significant oversight over our China-based operating subsidiaries
 could result in a material adverse change in their operations and in the value of our Common
 Stock. 

Uncertainties
 with respect to the PRC legal system and the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and
 regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us or result in a material
 adverse change to our subsidiaries business operations, and damage our and our subsidiaries 
 reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results
 of operations and cause our Common Stock to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

The
 PRC government may intervene or influence our subsidiaries business operations at
 any time, which could result in a material change in their business operations or the value
 of our investment in such subsidiaries. 

We
 have limited business insurance coverage in China. 

We
 may suffer currency exchange losses if the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar. 

30 

Governmental
 control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment. 

Labor
 laws in the PRC may adversely affect our operations. 

It
 may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments against us or our board of directors or officers
 because all of our operating and/or fixed assets are located in the PRC.. 

Because
 our assets are located overseas, shareholders may not receive distributions that they would
 otherwise be entitled to if we were declared bankrupt or insolvent . 

Risks Related to Our Company s Common Stock 

We
 will need to raise additional capital that will likely cause dilution to our shareholders. 

The
 trading volume of shares of our Common Stock has fluctuated from time to time, which may
 make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at times and prices that investors feel
 are appropriate. 

The
 Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing standards on our Common Stock that we may not be able
 to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our Common Stock. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

There are doubts about our company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our company s independent auditors have raised
doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds that will be required during
the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources, such as securities,
debt or equity financing or other potential sources. We intend to overcome the circumstances that impact our ability to remain a going
concern through a combination of new sources of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional financing.
We anticipate raising additional funds through public or private financing, securities financing and/or strategic relationships or other
arrangements in the near future to support our business operations; however, we may not have commitments from third parties for a sufficient
amount of additional capital. We cannot be certain that any such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and
our failure to raise capital when needed could limit our ability to continue our operations. Our ability to obtain additional funding
will determine if we can continue as a going concern. Failure to secure additional financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms
would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, results of operations and share price and require us to curtail or
cease operations, sell off assets, seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, or otherwise. Furthermore, additional
equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our shares, and debt financing, if available, may have onerous terms. including restrictive
covenants. Any additional financing could have a negative effect on our shareholders. 

31 

We have had a history of losses and our ability
to grow sales and achieve profitability are unpredictable. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit
of 70.14 million and incurred net losses of 22,318,056 and 34,921,745 in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our ability to maintain and improve future levels of sales and profitability depends on many factors, which include: 

successfully
 implementing our business strategy; 

increasing
 revenues; and 

controlling
 costs. 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully implement our business plan, meet our challenges and become profitable in the future. 

We have a substantial amount of existing debt,
which may restrict our financing and operating flexibility and have other adverse consequences; defaults could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In order to fund our operations and recent acquisitions
we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but
not limited to, the following: 

making it more difficult for
 us to service our debt obligations and liabilities; 

making us vulnerable to, and
 reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

requiring that a substantial
 portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to servicing debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us to fund working
 capital or other general corporate purposes; 

impeding our ability to obtain
 additional debt or equity financing and increasing the cost of any such borrowing, particularly due to the financial and other restrictive
 covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt; and 

adversely affecting public
 perception of us. 

32 

Although we believe we will be able to continue
to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate
sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness
when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to curtail or cease operations, sell off assets, seek protection
from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, or otherwise. 

We failed to realize any financial benefits
from most of our recent acquisitions and may be unable to realize any benefits from any other future transactions . 

Mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently
risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that acquisition of companies in the future will
be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In 2022, we recorded impairment
losses totaling approximately 5.4 million with respect to the goodwill relating to our acquisitions of the Guanzan Group, Zhongshan,
Guoyitang, Minkang, Qiangsheng and Eurasia. 

If we acquire other businesses, we may face difficulties,
including: 

Difficulties in integrating
 the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired businesses or enterprises; 

Diversion of management s
 attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting
 from acquisitions; 

Integrating financial forecasting
 and controls, procedures and reporting cycles; 

Difficulties in entering markets
 in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; 

The uncertainties in the operations
 of the target acquisitions caused by the COVID-19 that may prevent such companies from achieving their performance projections. 

Insufficient revenue to offset
 increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and 

The potential loss of key
 employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after
 announcement of acquisition plans. 

The impairment of intangible assets and goodwill
arising from our acquisitions could continue to negatively impact affect our net income and shareholders equity, 

When we acquire a business, a substantial portion
of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase
price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable
assets acquired. The current accounting standards require that goodwill and intangible assets should be deemed to have indefinite lives,
which should be tested for impairment at least annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise). Other intangible assets
are amortized over their useful lives. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we recorded goodwill impairment losses of 5,385,811
and 26,128,171, respectively. 

33 

Future declines in the results of our acquisitions
and other factors could cause us to record an impairment of all or a portion of the relevant goodwill in the future. We may not be able
to achieve our business targets for businesses we previously acquired or will acquire in the future, which could result in our incurring
additional goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charges. Further declines in our market capitalization increase the risk that
we may be required to perform another goodwill impairment analysis, which could result in an impairment of up to the entire balance of
our goodwill based on the quantitative assessment performed. 

Raising additional capital will be difficult
and may cause dilution to our shareholders and restrict our operations. 

We expect to finance our cash needs for our working
capital and the payment of the cash portion of our recent acquisitions. Although we have been able to obtain funding from outside
sources in the last year, we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to do so or to obtain additional financing on favorable
terms. One possible impediment to raising capital is the tightening credit policies of the Chinese banks and the prospects of tightening
in the global credit markets. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to operate our business,
take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. We cannot be sure that we will
be able to secure all the financing we will require, or that it will be available on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain necessary
financing, we will be required to substantially curtail our approach to implementing our business objectives. 

To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect shareholder rights. Debt financing and equity financing, if available,
may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures. 

The recent COVID-19 pandemic had a material
adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position during 2022. 

During late 2019, a virus now known as the novel
coronavirus or COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, the Peoples Republic of China PRC or China ). By
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization WHO labeled COVID-19 as a pandemic and many countries around the world
began closing borders and making efforts to either shelter-in-place or quarantine its population. During the first quarter of 2020, China
placed a mandatory quarantine on certain areas, specifically in Wuhan located in Hubei Province, which lasted for more than two months. 

Our company and all of its operations are located
in China. Since the pandemic broke out, our operations have been materially impacted. At the beginning of February 2020, the PRC government
issued a quarantine order, which lasted for more than two months in many parts of the country, where everyone had to stay at home. During
February and March, all of our administrative functions had to be performed remotely. Not until the beginning of April did we start to
have a small skeleton crew working in our office and were able to perform those functions that could not be handled remotely. 

34 

We have incurred additional costs to ensure we meet
the needs of our customers, including providing additional cleaning materials for our stores and other facilities. COVID-19 has also
caused supply chain disruption which has resulted in higher supply chain costs to replenish inventory in our stores and distribution
centers. Furthermore, we have experienced restricted stock availability in a number of key categories which negatively impacted us. Certain
popular and high profit margin products could not be sold due to governmental restrictive orders, which also resulted in the expiration
of a large quantify of our medicines that are otherwise in high demand in the winter season. The customer traffic in our retail pharmacy
stores in Dalian dropped greatly due to the pandemic. Because of the lockdown order that lasted for more than two months, we suffered
reduced sales and an operating loss in the first three quarters in 2020. Although some of the businesses in China have resumed their
daily activities while the pandemic was under control, there have been relapses in certain regions of the country which caused temporary
lockdowns. If similar lockdown orders or sales restrictions are implemented by the government, they may have greater impact on our business. 

We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners
and distribution channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which will
adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
position. In addition to volatility in consumer demand and buying habits, we may restrict the operations of our stores or distribution
facilities if we deem it necessary or if recommended or mandated by governmental authorities which would have a further adverse impact
on us. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts
us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the severity of the virus;
the duration of the outbreak; governmental, business and other actions (which could include limitations on our operations or mandates
to provide products or services); the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of shelter-in-place orders affecting foot traffic
in stores; the impacts on our supply chain; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; the extent and duration of the effect on
consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns including spend on discretionary categories; the health of and
the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our stores, hospitals, wholesale operations and other critical
functions, particularly if members of our work force are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of our tangible
or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls
including those over financial reporting as a result of changes in working environments such as shelter-in-place and similar orders that
are applicable to our team members and business partners, among others. In addition, if the pandemic continues to create disruptions
or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue
to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We cannot make any assurances that COVID-19 will
not reappear with new infections and to the extent that COVID-19, or another virus appears, we may encounter prolonged operational lockdown
measures which would disrupt our business operations. 

35 

The markets in which we now operate are very
competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us. 

In the Chinese pharmaceutical wholesale sector,
wholesalers without affiliated manufacturers have inherent risks, which include lack of control over product availability. We are at a
significant disadvantage in comparison to other wholesalers that are also manufacturers. Also, this sector is heavily regulated industry
where government exercises strong controls. Any comparative advantages we may have could be lost because of changes in laws or government
policies. 

We face intense competition with local, regional
and national companies, including other drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, dollar stores
and internet pharmacies. Competition from on-line retailers has significantly increased during the past few years. The ability of our
stores to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of loyal, repeat customers. 

Some of our competitors have or may merge with or
acquire pharmaceutical services companies, and health insurance companies, which may further increase competition. We may not be able
to effectively compete against some of our competitors in the retail pharmacy sector because they have financial and other resources
that are superior to ours. Further, we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased
competition, or that any of our competitors are not in a better position to absorb the impact of COVID-19. 

Our recently acquired hospitals compete with larger
and more established state-owned and private hospitals. We may not be able to effectively compete against these hospitals because they
have financial and other resources that are superior to ours and may be able to attract new patients more easily. 

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Many organizations in the healthcare industry have
consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power, which has contributed to continued pricing pressures.
If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further
pressure on the prices for our products and services and/or reduce our access to customers. If these pressures result in reductions in
our prices and/or reduce our access to customers, our business will become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding
reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement
policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially
resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, which may adversely impact
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our new strategy also includes selective acquisition opportunities
and we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

36 

Breaches of network or information technology
security could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Cyber security risks, such as a significant breach
of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and
reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information
that our customers provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer
loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend
upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information
security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our
data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained,
damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers,
financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business
operations, financial position and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional
resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. While no actual or attempted attacks have had a
material impact on our operations or financial condition, we cannot provide any assurance that our operations will not be negatively
materially affected by such attacks in the future. 

We rely on computer software and hardware
systems in managing our operations, the capacity of which may restrict our growth and the failure of which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are dependent upon our information management
system to monitor daily operations of our retail, wholesale and hospital businesses, and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating
and financial data for the compilation of management information. If our computer software and hardware systems fail to meet the increasing
needs of our expanding operations, our ability to grow may be constrained. Furthermore, any system failure which causes interruptions
to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or causes lags in service time could disrupt our normal operations. Although we believe
that our computer software and hardware systems are up to date and that our disaster recovery plan is adequate in handling potential
failures, we cannot provide assurance that we can effectively carry out this disaster recovery plan and that we will be able to restore
our operation within a sufficiently short time frame to avoid our business being disrupted. Furthermore, our systems are subject to damage
or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural
disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our
computer software and/or hardware systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial
costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to
perform critical functions. Due to the limited coverage of business interruption insurance policies offered in China, we do not carry
business interruption insurance and, as a result, any business disruption or natural disaster could severely disrupt our business and
operations and, in turn, significantly decrease our revenue and profitability. 

37 

If we fail to implement effective internal
controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or remedy any material weaknesses in our internal controls that we may identify,
such failure could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires
management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof.
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on
a timely basis. Due to the Company s limited resources, we currently do not have accounting personnel with extensive experience
in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification
and resolution of accounting matters inherent in our financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP. 

Any failure to complete our assessment of our internal
controls over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, including the one identified above, or
to implement new or improved controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result
in material misstatements in our financial statements. Inadequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial
reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our public disclosures and reported financial information, which could have
a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption
and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position,
and results of operations. 

We are subject to laws concerning our business operations
and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (the FCPA ), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws,
any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies
and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining
or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books
and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are
found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including
civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies
or receive export licenses. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies
relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management
and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or
other penalties, which could adversely affect our business operations, financial position, and results of operations. 

38 

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations
from investors, lenders, customers and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, policies
may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. 

Companies across all industries and around the globe
are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investors, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused
on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. The
increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors and lenders may reconsider their capital investment
allocation as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with investor, lender or other industry
shareholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing
concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business,
financial condition and price our company s shares could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes,
fire, power outages, floods, health epidemics and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism. 

Our operations, as well as our customers, are located
in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake,
tsunami, fire, flood, or other catastrophic event, such as a new pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our or their business,
which could in turn materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Our business could be subject to environmental
liabilities. 

Our failure to comply with past, present and future
environmental laws could result in fines, penalties, third-party claims, reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory
write-offs and reputational damage, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We
also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us, including
our newly acquired hospitals. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not been material. Although we cannot predict
the future effect of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the way we operate,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

39 

Failure to timely identify or effectively
respond to changing consumer preferences negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services. 

The success of our businesses depends in part on
customer loyalty and superior customer service. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preferences could
negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services. 

Moreover, customer expectations and new technology
advances from our competitors have required that our business evolve so that we are able to interface with our customers not only face-to-face
but also online and via mobile and social media. If we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectations and new technology developments,
our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected. 

Our success depends on our ability to establish
effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs. 

Our success depends on our ability to establish
effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs. Our pricing strategies and value propositions must be appropriate for our
target customers. If we are not able to maintain and increase the awareness of our businesses and the services we provide, we may not
be able to attract and retain customers and our reputation may also suffer. We expect to incur substantial expenses in our marketing
and promotional efforts to both attract and retain customers. However, our marketing and promotional activities may be less successful
than we anticipate, and may not be effective at building our brand awareness and customer base. In addition, the government may impose
restrictions on how marketing and promotional activities can be conducted. Failure to successfully execute our advertising, marketing
and promotional programs may result in material decreases in our revenue and profitability. 

Risks Relating to Our Wholesale Operations 

Failure to maintain relationships with our
customers or to otherwise expand our distribution network would materially and adversely affect our business . 

Our wholesale business sells products to drug stores,
private clinics, pharmaceutical distributors and hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2022 our top ten wholesale medical devices
and wholesale pharmaceuticals customers accounted 34 of our wholesale revenues and no customer accounted for more than 10 of sales.
In line with industry practices in the PRC, we enter into written sales agreements with our wholesale customers. However, such sales
agreements are not in substance equivalent to a typical distribution agreement in the United States. Each sales agreement is more in
the form of a sales order and specifies one or several purchases of one or more products without any continuing obligation to make purchases
unless it is a long-term agreement. Only about 10 of our wholesale customers are subject to purchase arrangements of one-year or longer
terms. Their purchases contributed more than 30 of our wholesale revenues in 2022. In the event distribution customers choose not to
continue their relationship with us after completing their existing sales agreements, they can do so without breaching any contract or
agreement. Our financial results could be adversely affected if we cannot replace these customers. We compete with large wholesalers,
many of whom may have higher visibility, greater name recognition, financial resources, and broader product selection than we do. Consequently,
maintaining relationships with existing customers may be difficult and time-consuming. 

40 

Our dependence on a limited number of customers
may expose us to the risk of substantial losses if a single large customer stops purchasing our products, purchases lower quantities
of our products or goes out of business and we are unable to attract new customers to recover such lost revenues. If any of our significant
customers reduces the quantity of the products they purchase from us or stops purchasing from us, our net revenue would be materially
and adversely affected. Any disruption in our distribution network could negatively affect our ability to effectively sell our products
and would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our wholesale pharmaceutical business operates
without the support of manufacturing capability and is at a significant disadvantage. 

In the Chinese pharmaceutical wholesale sector,
wholesalers without affiliated manufacturers have inherent risks which include lack of control over product availability and pricing
disadvantages. We are at a significant disadvantage in comparison to other wholesalers that are also manufacturers. 

Risks Relating to Our Pharmacy Business 

We may be subject to fines and penalties if
we fail to comply with the applicable PRC laws and regulations governing sales of medicines under China s National Medical Insurance
Program. 

Eligible participants in China s national
medical insurance program, including urban and suburban residents in China, are entitled to buy medicines using their medical insurance
cards from an authorized pharmacy, provided that the medicines they purchase have been included in the national or provincial medical
insurance catalogs. The pharmacy, in turn, obtains reimbursement from the relevant government social security bureaus. Moreover, the
applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations prohibit pharmacies from selling goods other than pre-approved medicines when purchases are
made with medical insurance cards. We have established procedures to prohibit our drugstores from selling unauthorized goods to customers
who make purchases with medical insurance cards. However, we cannot provide assurance that those procedures will be strictly followed
by all of our employees in all of our stores. 

Our ability to grow our pharmacy business
may be constrained by our inability to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the expiration of our current leases. 

Our ability to grow our business may be constrained
if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other
retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use regulations and other regulations applicable to the kinds
of stores we seek to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The
expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us
and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Furthermore, changing local demographics at existing store locations could materially
and adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores, and overall our business, financial condition, results of operation,
and prospects. 

41 

We may not be able to maintain proper inventory
levels for our pharmacy stores. 

To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast
inventory needs and place orders with our suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. We may not be able
to accurately forecast demand for supplies because of the difficulties of estimating the demand for our products. The volatile economic
environment and fast-evolving demands and preferences of our customers have made accurate projection of inventory levels increasingly
challenging. 

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may
result in inventory obsolescence, a decline in inventory values, inventory write-downs or write-offs, or expiration of products, which
would cause our gross margin to suffer and could impair the strength of our brand. High inventory levels may also require us to commit
substantial capital resources, preventing us from using them for other important business purposes. Conversely, if we underestimate customer
demand or if our suppliers fail to provide supplies to us in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Such inventory shortages
might result in unfilled customer needs, damage to our reputation, and have a negative impact on customer relationships and reduce our
sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain proper inventory levels for our operations and such failure may have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and profitability. 

Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy
services and we do not maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance. 

Pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the
distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of
prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. In addition, laws that
require our pharmacists to offer counseling, without additional charge, to customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common
side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to
warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce or negate these effects. We
currently do not maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance. Consequently, we may be required to expend
substantial funds to satisfy these types of claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and profitability. 

42 

Risks Related to Our Hospitals 

Our hospitals historically derived a significant
portion of their revenue by providing healthcare services to patients with public medical insurance coverage; any delayed payment under
China s public medical insurance programs could affect our results of operations. 

Our remaining hospital in China is a Medical Insurance Designated Medical
Institution. Patients who are covered by the public medical insurance programs may choose to rely on public medical insurance programs
to pay for some of healthcare services. Any dispute or late or delinquent settlement under the public medical insurance programs may cause
the trade receivables of our hospitals to increase or result in write-offs. Depending on the relevant public medical insurance programs 
practice, a Medical Insurance Designated Medical Institution may be subject to a government-approved annual quota for the medical fees
that it is allowed to recover from the relevant public medical insurance bureau. 

In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain
our hospital s status as Medical Insurance Designated Medical Institution, the loss of which will not only harm our reputation but
may also result in reduced patient visits. Furthermore, the PRC government may alter its reimbursement policies in coverage plans in the
future such that: (i) certain healthcare services provided by our hospitals will no longer be covered; or (ii) more stringent thresholds
on existing coverage may be imposed. Any reduction in the rates paid or the scope of services covered may reduce patient accessibility
to our hospitals and may lead to reduced patient flow and medical fees. Any of these events could lead to a decrease in our revenue generation
and profitability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. 

Our hospital could become the subject of patient
complaints, claims and legal proceedings in the course of its operations, which could result in costs and materially and adversely affect
our brand image, reputation and results of operations. 

We rely on the physicians and other medical professionals
of our hospitals to make proper clinical decisions regarding the diagnoses and treatment of their patients. However, we do not have direct
control over the clinical activities of our hospital or over the decisions and actions taken by the physicians and other medical professionals
as their diagnoses and treatments of patients are subject to their professional judgment and in most cases, must be performed on a real
time basis. Any incorrect decisions or actions on the part of the physicians and other medical professionals, or any failure by our hospitals
to properly manage their clinical activities may result in undesirable or unexpected outcomes, including complications, injuries and
even deaths in extreme cases. In addition, there are inherent risks associated with the clinical activities that may result in unavoidable
and unfavorable medical outcomes. 

In recent years, physicians, hospitals and other
healthcare service providers in China have become subject to an increasing number of patient complaints, claims and legal proceedings
alleging malpractice or other causes of action. Although rare, incidents have occurred in hospitals and medical institutions in China
where dissatisfied patients carried out extreme actions or even violence during the course of the disputes. Any such incident, if occurs,
would harm our reputation, impair the ability of our hospitals to recruit and retain medical professionals and staff, discouraging other
patients from visiting our hospital, and cause us to incur substantial costs. 

43 

Any negative publicity about us, our hospital or
the healthcare service industry could harm the brand image and reputation and trust in the services provided by our hospitals, which
could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and prospects. 

If we fail to properly manage the employment
of the physicians and other medical professionals of our hospital, we may be subject to penalties, which could materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations. 

The activities of physicians and other medical professionals are strictly
regulated under the PRC laws and regulations. Physicians, nurses and medical technicians who practice at medical institutions must hold
licenses and may only practice within the scope of their licenses and at the specific medical institutions at which their licenses are
registered. In practice, it takes some time for physicians, nurses and medical technicians to transfer their licenses from one medical
institution to another or add another medical institution to their permitted practicing institutions. We cannot assure you that our physicians
will complete the transfer of their licenses and related government procedures timely or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that
the medical professionals at our hospitals will always strictly follow the requirements and will not practice outside the permitted scope
of their respective licenses. Any failure to properly manage the employment of our physicians and other medical professionals may subject
us to administrative penalties against our hospital, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

We have limited or no control over the quality
of pharmaceuticals, medical consumables and other medical equipment used in the operations of our hospital. If such quality does not
meet the required standards, we could be exposed to liabilities and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects could be adversely affected. 

The provision of healthcare services involves the
frequent use of a variety of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and medical consumables, substantially of which we procure from suppliers
we do not have control over. We cannot assure you that all supplies are authentic, free of defects and meet the relevant quality standards.
If these supplies are subsequently found to have been defective at the time of the supply, even though we did not know or could not have
known about such defect, we may be subject to liability claims, negative publicity, reputational damage or administrative sanction, any
of which may adversely affect our results of operations and reputation. We cannot assure you that significant claims of such nature will
not be asserted against us in the future, and that adverse verdicts will not be reached or that we will be able to recover losses from
our suppliers. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to find suitable replacement suppliers, failing which our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected. 

Our hospital s operations are susceptible
to fluctuations in the costs of pharmaceuticals and medical consumables, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of
operations. 

The profitability of our hospital is influenced by fluctuations in
the costs of pharmaceuticals and medical consumables. The availability and prices of the pharmaceuticals and medical consumables can fluctuate
from time to time and are subject to factors beyond our control, including supply, demand, general economic conditions and governmental
regulations, each of which may affect the procurement costs or cause a disruption in the supply. Consistent with industry practice, we
have not entered into any long-term supply agreements with our suppliers and we cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate and
react to changes in medical supply costs in the future by locating replacement suppliers or adjusting service offerings, or that our hospitals
will be able to pass these cost increases onto the patients. Any of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our profitability
and results of operations. 

44 

Our performance depends on our ability to
recruit and retain skilled physicians. 

The success of our hospital depends in part on the number and quality
of the physicians and the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good
relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. We may face increased challenges in this
area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable
services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet
the needs of those physicians and their patients, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline. 

As a provider of medical services, we are
exposed to inherent risks relating to malpractice claims. 

As a provider of medical services, any misdiagnosis
or improper treatment may result in negative publicity regarding us or our services, which would harm our reputation. If we are found
liable for malpractice, we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Furthermore, even if we successfully defend ourselves
against a malpractice claim, we could be required to spend significant management, financial and other resources in the process, which
could disrupt our business, and our reputation and brand name may also suffer. Since malpractice claims are not common in China, we do
not carry malpractice insurance. As a result, any imposition of malpractice liability could materially harm our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Regulatory pricing controls may affect the
pricing of our hospital. 

The PRC government issues policies on the pricing of healthcare services,
pharmaceuticals and medical consumables. As a Medical Insurance Designated Medical Institution, our hospital is subject to the pricing
guidelines set by the relevant local healthcare administrative authorities. We cannot predict if the PRC government will lower the price
ceilings or change the pricing guidelines in the future or if additional healthcare services, pharmaceuticals or medical consumables may
become subject to price control, or more stringent insurance reimbursement limits, which may put pressure on the pricing of our hospitals.
As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

45 

Risks Related to Our Human Capital 

We may be unable to attract, hire, and retain
a highly qualified workforce, including key management. 

The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly
our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant business experience and would be difficult to replace.
In addition, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain them or to attract
other highly qualified employees, including our medical staff and workers, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are
competitive with the rest of the labor market. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified employee talent,
or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect
our business and our future success. 

We substantially depend on a few key personnel
who, if not retained, could cause declines in productivity and operational results and loss of our strategic guidance, all of which would
diminish our business prospects and value to investors. 

Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued
service of a few executive officers and key employees, including, Mr. Tiewei Song, our Chief Executive Officer and President. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key employees would have an adverse effect on us and our PRC operating subsidiaries, as these individuals
play a significant role in developing and executing our overall business plan and maintaining customer relationships and proprietary
technology systems. While none of our key personnel is irreplaceable, the loss of the services of any of these individuals would be disruptive
to our business. We believe that our overall future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled
managerial and marketing personnel. There is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel on terms
acceptable to us or the employee. Inadequate personnel will limit our growth, and will be seen as a detriment to our prospects,
leading potentially to a loss in value for investors. 

Our labor costs may be adversely affected
by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity. 

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities
and experience of our management and employees. We compete with other businesses and health care providers in recruiting and retaining
qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our businesses including our hospitals. In
some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated workforce competition and shortages. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit
and retain medical and medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs
could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we
operate. If a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. Our failure to recruit
and retain qualified management, medical and support personnel, pharmacists and other personnel, or to control labor costs, could have
a material, adverse effect on our results of operations. 

46 

We are responsible for the indemnification
of our officers and directors. 

The Delaware General Corporation law and our bylaws
provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against costs and expenses
incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on our behalf. We currently
do not have any directors and officers liability insurance. Consequently, we may be required to expend substantial funds to satisfy
these indemnity obligations. Any payment in respect of these indemnification rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and profitability. 

Risk Related to Doing Business in China 

Changes in the political and economic policies
of the PRC government or in relations between China and the United States or other governments may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and may result in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies. 

Due to our operations in China, our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by economic, political, legal and social conditions
in the PRC or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. There is significant uncertainty
about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and
tariffs. China s economy differs from the economies of other countries in many respects, including with respect to the level of
development, growth rate, amount of government involvement, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While China s
economy has experienced significant growth over the past four decades, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various
economic sectors. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation
of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. In addition, in the
past the Chinese government implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to manage the pace of economic growth and
prevent the economy from overheating. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business
and results of operations. 

Adverse changes in economic and political
policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect
our business. 

Recent statements by the PRC government have indicated
an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investments in China-based issuers.
The PRC government recently initiated a series of regulatory actions and made a number of public statements on the regulation of business
operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision
over China-based companies listed overseas using a variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity
reviews, and expanding efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. 

Currently, these statements and regulatory actions
have had no impact on our daily business operations, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on a U.S. or other
foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how the legislative or administrative
regulation making bodies will further respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations
will be further modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our
daily business operations, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on a U.S., Hong Kong, or other stock exchanges.
There are still substantial uncertainties as to how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in practice and whether
we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our offshore
offerings. If the CSRC, CAC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals
for our future offshore offerings, we may be unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals may be
rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. In addition, implementation of industry-wide
regulations directly targeting our operations could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline. Therefore, investors
of our company face potential uncertainty from actions taken by the PRC government affecting our business. 

47 

Substantially all of our business operations are
currently conducted in the PRC, under the jurisdiction of the PRC government. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition
and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political and legal developments in China. China s economy differs
from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level
of development, growth rate, and control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant
growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of China. The PRC government
has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. 

Our business and revenue growth primarily depend
on the size of the healthcare market in China. As a result, our revenue and profitability may be negatively affected by changes in national,
regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence in China. External factors beyond our control that affect consumer confidence
include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, national, regional or local economic conditions, and acts of war or
terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending
patterns. A decrease in overall consumer spending as a result of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our product sales
and negatively impact our profitability. In addition, acts of war or terrorism may cause damage to our facilities, disrupt the supply
of the products and services we offer in our stores, or adversely impact consumer demand. Any of these factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If for any reason we were to fail to meet
the audit requirements of the HFCAA for two consecutive years, we may be prohibited from listing our securities on a national
securities exchange, including Nasdaq, or on over-the-counter markets in the United States, which could adversely affect the market price
of our Common Stock and our ability to raise capital. 

In recent years, the U.S. Congress and regulatory
authorities have expressed concerns about challenges in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant
operations in mainland China and with auditors located in mainland China. For example, PCAOB inspections of auditors located in mainland
China and Hong Kong have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors audit procedures and quality control procedures, and
limitations on the ability of the PCAOB to inspect or investigate auditors in mainland China or Hong Kong could deprive investors of
the benefits of PCAOB inspections, which could adversely affect the ability of companies using such auditors to access U.S. capital markets. 

As part of the continued focus on access to audit
and other information for companies with substantial operations in China, in December 2020, the United States enacted the HFCAA,
which requires the SEC to identify issuers that have filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting
firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because
of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor s local jurisdiction (a Commission-Identified Issuer ).
Under the HFCAA, as amended in December 2022, if the SEC conclusively identifies an issuer as a Commission-Identified Issuer for
two consecutive years, the SEC is required to prohibit the trading of the issuer s securities on a national securities exchange
or through any other method that is within the jurisdiction of the SEC to regulate, including over-the-counter markets in the United
States. 

In 2021, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report,
which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland
China and Hong Kong because of positions taken by Chinese authorities in those jurisdictions. In December 2022, the PCAOB vacated its
determination that it was unable to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in mainland China. As a result,
until such time as the PCAOB issues a new determination, the SEC has determined that there are no issuers currently at risk of having
their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCAA. Although we are not currently at risk of delisting pursuant to
the HFCAA, if the PCAOB were to issue a new determination regarding limitations on its ability to inspect or investigate our independent
auditor and we were to fail to meet the audit requirements of the HFCAA for two consecutive years, our securities may be prohibited
from trading on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter market in the United States, and this could result in our Common Stock
being delisted from Nasdaq. Delisting of our Common Stock would force holders to sell their shares of our Common Stock. The foregoing
could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and our ability to raise capital. The market price of our Common Stock could
be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of such legislative or executive actions upon, as well as negative
investor sentiment toward, companies with significant operations in mainland China and Hong Kong that are listed in the United States,
regardless of whether such actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance. 

48 

The filing or other procedures with, the
CSRC or other Chinese regulatory authorities may be required in connection with issuing our equity securities to foreign investors under
Chinese law, and, we cannot predict whether we will be able, or how long it will take us, to complete such filing or other procedures. If
we fail to complete a filing with the CSRC, our future offering application may be impacted and we may be subject to penalties, sanctions
and fines imposed by the CSRC. 

On February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (the CSRC issued the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic
Companies (the Trial Administrative Measures and relevant supporting guidelines (collectively, the New Administrative
Rules Regarding Overseas Listings ), which came into force on March 31, 2023. According to the New Administrative Rules Regarding
Overseas Listings, among other things, a domestic company in the PRC that seeks to offer and list securities in overseas markets must
fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial Administrative Measures. Initial public offerings
or listings in overseas markets must file with the CSRC within three (3) working days after the relevant application is submitted overseas.
If an issuer offers securities in the same overseas market where it has previously offered and listed securities subsequently, filings
have to be made with the CSRC within three (3) working days after the offering is completed. Upon occurrence of any material event, such
as change of control, investigations or sanctions imposed by an overseas securities regulatory agency or other relevant competent authority,
change of listing status or transfer of listing segment, or voluntary or mandatory delisting, after an issuer has offered and listed
securities in an overseas market, the issuer must submit a report thereof to CSRC within three (3) working days after the occurrence
and public disclosure of such event. On February 24, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives
Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Confidentiality and Archives Administration
Provisions ), which also became effective on March 31, 2023. The Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions set out
rules, requirements and procedures relating to provision of documents, materials and accounting archives for securities companies, securities
service providers, overseas regulators and other entities and individuals in connection with overseas offering and listing, including
without limitation to, domestic companies that carry out overseas offering and listing (either in direct or indirect means) and the securities
companies and securities service providers (either incorporated domestically or overseas) that undertake relevant businesses shall not
leak any state secret and working secret of government agencies, or harm national security and public interest, and a domestic company
shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with the secrecy administrative department at the same
level, if it plans to, either directly or through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide any documents and materials
that contain state secrets or working secrets of government agencies. Working papers produced in the Chinese mainland by securities companies
and securities service providers in the process of undertaking businesses related to overseas offering and listing by domestic companies
shall be retained in the Chinese mainland. Where such documents need to be transferred or transmitted to outside the Chinese mainland,
relevant approval procedures stipulated by regulations shall be followed. While we believe we do not involve leaking any state secret
and working secret of government agencies, or harming national security and public interest in connection with provision of documents,
materials and accounting archives, there is uncertainty how the new provisions will be interpreted and implemented in the future, and
we may be required to perform additional procedures in connection with the provision of accounting archives after the Confidentiality
and Archives Administration Provisions come into effect. Any failure by us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our Common Stock or our other securities, cause significant disruption
to our business operations, severely damage our reputation, materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
and cause our Common Stock or such other securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. 

49 

PRC regulations on loans and direct investments
by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC
subsidiaries and may prevent the use of our funds held in the PRC or Hong Kong or by a PRC or Hong Kong entity to fund our operations
or for use outside of the PRC or Hong Kong.. 

As an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiaries,
we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Such loans to our
PRC subsidiaries in China and capital contributions are subject to PRC regulations and approvals or filing. For example, loans by us
to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its local branch. Information about capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries must be filed with the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, the PRC
government also restricts the convertibility of foreign currencies into Renminbi and use of the proceeds. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated
Circular 19, which took effect and replaced certain previous SAFE regulations from June 1, 2015. SAFE further promulgated Circular 16,
effective on June 9, 2016, which, among other things, amend certain provisions of Circular 19. According to SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE
Circular 16, the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested
company is regulated such that Renminbi capital may not be used for business beyond its business scope or to provide loans to persons
other than affiliates unless otherwise permitted under its business scope. On October 23, 2019, SAFE promulgated Circular 28, which stipulates
that non-investment foreign-funded enterprises are allowed to make domestic equity investment with their capital funds on the premise
that the Negative List is not violated and the projects invested thereby in China are true and compliant. Violations of the applicable
circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations.
The Circular Regarding Further Optimizing the Cross-border RMB Policy to Support the Stabilization of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment
jointly promulgated by the PBOC, NDRC, the Ministry of Commerce, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of
the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission and SAFE on December 31, 2020 and effective on February 4, 2021
allows the non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic reinvestment with RMB capital in accordance with the law on the
premise that they comply with prevailing regulations and the invested projects in China are authentic and compliant. In addition, if
a foreign-invested enterprise uses RMB income under capital accounts to conduct domestic reinvestment, the invested enterprise is not
required to open a special deposit account for RMB capital. 

Due to interventions or the imposition of transfer
restrictions by the PRC government, funds or assets located in the PRC or Hong Kong or held by a PRC or Hong Kong entity, may not be
available to us to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC or Hong Kong. 

The applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules
may significantly limit our ability to convert, transfer and use the net proceeds from public or private financings of equity or convertible
notes or any offering of any equity securities in China, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. As the foreign exchange related regulatory regime and practice are complex and still evolving and involve many uncertainties,
we cannot assure you that we have complied or will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange circulars and rules, or that
we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans
by us to our PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such
registrations or filings, our ability to contribute additional capital to fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could
adversely and materially affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

50 

Our retail, wholesale operations, pharmacies
and hospitals require a number of permits and licenses in order to carry on their business. 

We are required to obtain certain permits and licenses
from various PRC governmental authorities to operate our businesses. We are subject to a number of regulations pertaining to the licensing
of our wholesale business, retail pharmacies, and the licensing, conduct and number of medical professionals. We cannot provide any assurance
that we can maintain all required licenses, permits and certifications to carry on our business at all times. Moreover, these licenses,
permits and certifications are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the relevant PRC governmental authorities and the standards
of such renewal or reassessment may change from time to time. We intend to apply for renewal of these licenses, permits and certifications
when required by applicable laws and regulations. Any failure by us to obtain and maintain all licenses, permits and certifications necessary
to carry on our business at any time could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, any inability to renew any of these licenses, permits and certifications could severely disrupt our business, and prevent
us from continuing to carry on our business. Any changes in the standards used by governmental authorities in considering whether to
renew or reassess our business licenses, permits and certifications, as well as any enactment of new regulations that may restrict the
conduct of our business, may also decrease our revenue and/or increase our costs, materially reducing our profitability and prospects.
Furthermore, if the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations changes or if new regulations come into effect
requiring us to obtain any additional licenses, permits or certifications that were previously not required to operate our existing businesses,
we cannot provide assurance that we can successfully obtain such licenses, permits or certifications. We believe our PRC subsidiaries
have obtained all applicable licenses and permits which are material to our business operations in China. 

The operations of our hospitals are subject to various
laws and regulations at the national and local levels. These laws and regulations mainly relate to the operations of medical institutions
and licensing of medical professionals, the use and safety management of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, the quality and pricing
of healthcare services, occupational health and safety as well as environmental protection. In addition, our hospitals are subject to
periodic license or permit renewal requirements and inspections by various government agencies and departments at the provincial and
municipal level. 

If we fail to maintain or renew any major license,
permit, certificate or approval for all or any of our acquired hospitals, or if the medical professionals in above hospitals become unlicensed
at any time during their practices, or if the hospitals are found to be non-compliant with any applicable laws or regulations, we may
face penalties, suspension of operations or even revocation of operating licenses, depending on the nature of the findings, any of which
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we do not maintain the privacy and security
of sensitive patient, customer and business information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs and become
subject to litigation; We may become subject to cybersecurity review. 

The protection of patient, customer, employee, and
company data is critical to our businesses. Our hospitals collect and maintain medical data and treatment records of our patients. PRC
laws and regulations generally require medical institutions and their medical personnel to protect the privacy of their customers and
prohibit unauthorized disclosure of personal information. Such medical institutions and their medical personnel will be liable for damage
caused by divulging the customers private or medical records without consent. We have taken measures to maintain the confidentiality
of our customers medical records, including encrypting such information in our information technology system so that it cannot
be viewed without proper authorization and setting internal rules requiring our employees to maintain the confidentiality of our customers 
medical records. However, these measures may not always be effective in protecting our customers medical records. Our information
technology systems could be breached through hacking. Personal information could be leaked due to any theft or misuse of personal information
due to misconduct or negligence. Failure to protect customers medical records, or any restriction on or liability as a result
of, our use of medical data, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

51 

The regulatory environment surrounding information
security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. Compliance
with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in
technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these
laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation
and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or
otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may
not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially
have an adverse effect on our businesses. 

Our business involves collecting and retaining certain
internal and external data and information including that of our patients, customers and suppliers. The integrity and protection of such
information and data are crucial to us and our business. Owners of such data and information expect that we will adequately protect their
personal information. We are required by applicable laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and
to take adequate security measures to safeguard such information. 

The PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment
7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits institutions, companies and their employees
from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained in performing duties or providing services
or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People s
Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Cyber
Security Law, network operators must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only collect users 
personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance for their products
and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under the relevant laws
and regulations. 

The Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National
People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides legal basis for privacy and personal information
infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, have been increasingly focused on regulation in data security and data
protection. 

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the
National People s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which went into effect in September 2021.
The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities, and
introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development,
and the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations
when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national
security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information. 

The PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity
are evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Public
Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and regulations with varying
and evolving standards and interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came
into effect on June 1, 2020. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass
a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. 

52 

On December 28, 2021, the Chinese government promulgated
Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February 15, 2022. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the procurement
of any network product or service by an operator of critical information infrastructure or the conducting of data processing activities
by a network platform operator, that affects or may affect national security, will be subject to a cybersecurity review. A network platform
operator that possess personal information of more than one million users must apply to the Cybersecurity Review Office set up under
the CAC for a cybersecurity review when it seeks to list overseas. 

Moreover, the CAC promulgated the Measures
for the Security Assessment of Cross-border Data Transmission, which became effective as of September 1, 2022. According to these measures,
personal data processors are subject to security assessment prior to any cross-border transfer of data if the transfer involves (i) important
data; (ii) personal information transferred overseas by operators of critical information infrastructure or a data processor that has
processed personal data of more than one million persons; (iii) personal information transferred overseas by a data processor who has
already provided personal data of 100,000 persons or sensitive personal data of 10,000 persons overseas since January 1 of last year;
or (iv) other circumstances as requested by the CAC. Any cross-border data transfer activities conducted in violation of the Measures
for the Security Assessment of Cross-border Data Transmission before the effectiveness of these measures are required to be rectified
by March 2023. Though these measures have already taken effect, substantial uncertainties still exist with respect to the interpretation
and implementation of these measures in practice and how they will affect our business operation. 

The CAC has taken action against several Chinese
internet companies listed on U.S. securities exchanges for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal
information of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security
Law of the People s Republic of China (the National Security Law ), the Cyber Security Law and the Cybersecurity Review
Measures. Effective February 15, 2022, the CAC, together with 12 other PRC governmental authorities, promulgated the Revised Cybersecurity
Review Measures, pursuant to which critical information infrastructure operators procuring network products and services and online platform
operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review.
In addition, online platform operators possessing personal information of more than one million users seeking to be listed on foreign
stock markets must apply for a cybersecurity review. The relevant competent governmental authorities may also initiate a cybersecurity
review against the relevant operators if the authorities believe that the network product or service or data processing activities of
such operators affect or may affect national security. There are still uncertainties as to the exact scope of network product or service
or data processing activities that will or may affect national security, and the PRC government authorities may have discretion in the
interpretation and enforcement of these measures. 

Based on the opinion of our PRC counsel, Chongqing Jinmujinyang (Jiulongpo)
Law Firm (a/k/a in English: Chongqing Kingmoon Kingyang (Jiulongpo) Law Firm), we do not expect that the current PRC laws on cybersecurity
or data security will have a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, as there remains significant uncertainty in
the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we could be subject to cybersecurity review, and
if so, we may not be able to pass such review. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations
launched by PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance
with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including suspension of business, website closure, removal
of our app from the relevant app stores, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings
or actions against us, which may have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of the
date of this report, we have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the Cyber Administration of
China or related governmental regulatory authorities, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanction in such respect.
We believe that we are in compliance with the aforementioned regulations and policies that have been issued by the Cyber Administration
of China.

The impact of China s regulatory reforms
is unpredictable. 

The regulatory system of Chinese medical service,
especially the changes in the field of healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on the operation and development of our business
in the future. New laws and policies are expected to be promulgated. It is uncertain what impact these new regulations and policies would
have on our competitiveness, operations and corporate structure. In recent years, the PRC government launched a new healthcare reform
plan to ensure that every citizen has access to affordable basic healthcare services. In pursuit of these policy objectives, the PRC
government has implemented extensive regulations and policies to address the affordability, accessibility and quality of healthcare services,
medical insurance coverage, distribution of pharmaceutical products and reform of public hospitals. In addition, the PRC government has
gradually reduced regulatory hurdles for establishing and investing in private hospitals, in particular by private capital, and encouraged
development of hospital management groups. 

Our business operations and future expansion are
largely driven by the PRC government s policies, which may change significantly and are beyond our control. There can be no assurance
that the PRC government will not impose additional or stricter laws or regulations on healthcare services or foreign investments, or
strengthen and tighten supervision and management of medical institutions including hospitals, in particular, private hospitals, or implement
stricter or more comprehensive regulations on the distribution of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and medical consumables. 

Depending on the priorities of the PRC government,
the political situation and the regulatory regime with respect to foreign investment control at any given time, and the development of
the Chinese healthcare system, future regulatory changes may affect public hospital reform, limit private or foreign investments in healthcare
service industry, change reimbursement rates for healthcare services provided to publicly insured patients, or implement additional price
control on pharmaceuticals or healthcare services. Any of these events could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, prospects and future growth. 

The PRC government s significant oversight
over our China-based operating subsidiaries could result in a material adverse change in their operations and in the value of our Common
Stock. 

Our business is conducted through our operating
subsidiaries in China, whose operations are governed by PRC law and regulations. The PRC government has significant oversight over the
conduct of our subsidiaries and it regulates and may intervene in their operations. which could result in a material adverse change in
the subsidiaries business operations and or the value of our Common Stock. Also, the PRC government has recently indicated an
intent to exert more oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas and: or foreign investment in China-based issuers. Any such
action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors. In addition,
implementation of industry-wide regulations directly targeting our subsidiaries operations could cause our securities
to significantly decline in value or become worthless. Therefore. investors in our company face potential uncertainty from actions taken
by the PRC government affecting the business of our subsidiaries. 

There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation
and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations. 

Our Chinese subsidiaries are subject to laws,
rules and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes.
Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. In 1979, the Chinese
government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall
effect of legislation over the past four decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment
in China. However, China s legal system is still developing. The laws, rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and enforcement
by PRC regulatory agencies and courts. In particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, because of the limited
number of published decisions and the non-precedential nature of such decisions, and because the laws, rules and regulations often give
the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations
involve uncertainties and can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the legal system is based in part on government policies
and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and which may have a retroactive effect. The regulations
in China can change quickly. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence
of the violation. 

54 

China s Foreign Investment Law and its implementing
rule came into force in January 2020. The Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules embody an expected regulatory trend to rationalize
China s foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify
the legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. There are still uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and
implementation of the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules. For example, the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing
rules provide that foreign invested entities established according to the previous laws regulating foreign investment prior to its implementation
may maintain their structure and corporate governance for a five-year transition period. It is uncertain whether governmental authorities
may require us to adjust the structure and corporate governance of certain of our Chinese subsidiaries in such transition period. Failure
to take timely and appropriate measures to meet any of these or similar regulatory requirements could materially affect our current corporate
governance practices and business operations and our compliance costs may increase significantly. In addition, the Security Review Rules,
effective from January 18, 2021, embody China s continued efforts to provide a legal regime for national security review comparable to
similar procedures in other jurisdictions, such as CFIUS review in the United States. There are still uncertainties with respect to the
interpretation, implementation and enforcement of the Security Review Rules. For example, national security remains undefined and there
is no clear guidance on whether the biotechnology industry requires security review and what factors the regulatory authority may consider
in determining whether there are security concerns. It is difficult to evaluate the impact of the Security Review Rules on our existing
investments or potential investments in China. 

It may be difficult for overseas regulators to
conduct investigations or collect evidence within China. In China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information
needed for regulatory investigations or litigations initiated outside China. According to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, which
became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection
activities within the PRC territory. According to the Revised Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions, where overseas
securities regulators or relevant competent authorities request to inspect, investigate or collect evidence from Chinese domestic companies
concerning their overseas offering and listing or their securities firms and securities service providers that undertake securities business
for such Chinese domestic companies, such inspection, investigation and evidence collection must be conducted under the cross-border
regulatory cooperation mechanism, and the CSRC or competent authorities of the Chinese government will provide necessary assistance pursuant
to bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanism. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism
with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such
cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of a mutual and practical
cooperation mechanism. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability
for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigations or evidence collection activities within China may further increase
the difficulties you face in protecting your interests. For risks associated with investing in us as a Cayman Islands company, see also
 Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares, ADSs, and RMB Shares We are a Cayman Islands company. Because judicial precedent
regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under Cayman Islands law than under Hong Kong law, Chinese law or U.S. law, our
shareholders may have fewer shareholder rights than they would have under Hong Kong law, Chinese law or U.S. law and may face difficulties
in protecting their interests. 

Any administrative and court proceedings in China
may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since administrative and court
authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to
evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal
systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered and could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the PRC government has announced its plans to enhance its regulatory
oversight of China-based companies listed overseas and cross-border law enforcement cooperation. The Securities Opinions called for: 

tightening
 oversight of data security, cross-border data flow and administration of classified information,
 as well as amendments to relevant regulation to specify responsibilities of overseas listed
 China-based companies with respect to data security and information security; 

enhanced
oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by China-based companies; and 

extraterritorial
 application of China s securities laws. 

55 

There are great uncertainties
with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the Securities Opinions and the newly promulgated Overseas Listing Trial Measures.
The PRC government may promulgate relevant laws, rules and regulations to impose additional and significant obligations and liabilities
on overseas listed China-based companies regarding data security, cross-border data flow, and compliance with China s securities
laws. As a company with operations in China and stock listings in and outside of China, it is uncertain whether or how these laws, rules
and regulations and their interpretation and implementation may affect us. However, among other things, our ability to obtain external
financing through the issuance of equity securities overseas could be adversely affected if restrictions on overseas fundraising are
imposed on companies like us. 

The PRC government may intervene or influence
our subsidiaries business operations at any time, which could result in a material change in their business operations or the
value of our investment in such subsidiaries. 

We do not conduct any business operations. our business
operations are conducted through our subsidiaries in the PRC, which subject our subsidiaries and us to certain laws and regulations in
China. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese
economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations,
including those relating to taxation. environmental regulations. land use rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments
of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations These regulations may be interpreted
and applied inconsistently by different agencies or authorities. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly
adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. and such compliance or any associated inquiries or investigations
or any other government actions may: 

delay
or impede our development; 

result
in negative publicity or increase our operating costs: 

require
significant management time and attention: and 

subject
us and our subsidiaries to remedies. administrative penalties and even criminal liabilities that may harm our subsidiaries business,
including fines assessed for our current or historical operations. or demands or orders that they modify or even cease their business
practices. 

Government actions in the future. including any
decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations
in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof.
and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in our Chinese subsidiaries. 

We have limited business insurance coverage
in China. 

The insurance industry in China is still at an early
stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. As a result, we do not have any business
liability or disruption insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption, litigation or natural disaster might
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. 

Because our funds are held in banks in the
PRC that do not provide insurance, the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business. 

Banks and other financial institutions in the PRC
do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. A portion of our assets are in the form of cash deposited with banks in the PRC,
and in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to our funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in
a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash could impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay
our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue in business. 

56 

We may suffer currency exchange losses if
the RMB depreciates relative to the US Dollar. 

Our reporting currency is the US dollar. However,
substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. In July 2005, China changed its exchange rate regime by establishing a managed
floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The RMB is no longer officially
pegged to the US dollar, and the exchange rate will have some flexibility. Despite fluctuations in the exchange rate in 2020, the floating
exchange rate regime has remained stable. If the RMB depreciates relative to the US dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US dollar
financial statements will decline in value and if the RMB appreciates relative to the US dollar, our revenues as expressed in our US
dollar financial statement s will increase in value. There are very limited hedging transactions available in China to reduce our exposure
to exchange rate fluctuations. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness
of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, if at all. In addition, our currency exchange
losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into US dollars. 

Governmental control of currency conversion
may affect the value of your investment. 

The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility
of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive all our revenues in RMB.
Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments
and expenditures from trade related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the Chinese State Administration
of Foreign Exchange SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from SAFE or its local
branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and can be remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as
the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future
to foreign currencies for current account transactions. 

The Chinese government has strengthened the
regulation of investments made by Chinese residents in offshore companies and reinvestments in China made by these offshore companies.
Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions. 

The SAFE has adopted certain regulations that require
registration with, and approval from, Chinese government authorities in connection with direct or indirect control of an offshore entity
by Chinese residents. The term control under SAFE regulation is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights
or decision-making rights acquired by PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles or PRC companies by means of acquisition,
trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. The SAFE regulations retroactively require registration
of investments in non-Chinese companies previously made by Chinese residents. In particular, the SAFE regulations require Chinese residents
to file with SAFE information about offshore companies in which they have directly or indirectly invested and to make follow-up filings
in connection with certain material transactions involving such offshore companies, such as mergers, acquisitions, capital increases
and decreases, external equity investments or equity transfers. In addition, Chinese residents must obtain approval from SAFE before
they transfer domestic assets or equity interests in exchange for equity or other property rights in an offshore company. A newly established
enterprise in China which receives foreign investments is also required to provide detailed information about its controlling shareholders
and to certify whether it is directly or indirectly controlled by a domestic entity or resident. 

In the event that a Chinese shareholder with a direct
or indirect stake in an offshore parent company fails to make the requisite SAFE registration, the Chinese subsidiaries of such offshore
parent company may be prohibited from making distributions of profit to the offshore parent and from paying the offshore parent proceeds
from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the Chinese subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with
the various SAFE registration requirements described above can result in liability under Chinese law for foreign exchange evasion. 

57 

These regulations may have a significant impact
on our present and future structuring and investment. We have requested our shareholders who to our knowledge are PRC residents to make
the necessary applications, filings and amendments as required under these regulations. We intend to take all necessary measures to ensure
that all required applications and filings will be duly made and all other requirements will be met. We further intend to structure and
execute our future offshore acquisitions in a manner consistent with these regulations and any other relevant legislation. However, because
it is presently uncertain how the SAFE regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will
be interpreted and implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our future offshore financing or acquisitions,
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to comply with, qualify under, or obtain any approvals required by the regulations
or other legislation. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any PRC shareholders of our company or any PRC company into which we invest
will be able to comply with those requirements. The inability of our company or any PRC shareholder to secure required approvals or registrations
in connection with our future offshore financings or acquisitions may subject us to legal sanctions, restrict our ability to pay dividends
from our Chinese subsidiaries to our offshore holding company, and restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities or affect
our ownership structure. 

Labor laws in the PRC may adversely affect
our operations. 

The Labor Contract Law of the PRC imposes liabilities
on employers and significantly impacts the cost of an employer s decision to reduce its workforce. The law requires certain terminations
to be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, this law could adversely
affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner,
thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. 

The PRC may establish complex procedures for
some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions
in China. 

PRC regulations and rules concerning mergers and
acquisitions including the Rules on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, and other
recently adopted regulations and rules with respect to mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that
could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M A Rules require
that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic
enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have impact
on the national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds
a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law of PRC promulgated on August 30, 2007
and the Provisions of the State Council on the Threshold of Filings for Undertaking Concentrations, or the Prior Notification Rules issued
by the State Council in August 2008 and amended on September 2018, the concentration of business undertakings by way of mergers, acquisitions
or contractual arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must
also be notified in advance to the MOFCOM when the threshold is crossed and such concentration shall not be implemented without the clearance
of prior notification. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements
of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval
processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions.
We believe that our business is not in an industry that raises national defense and security or national security 
concerns. However, the MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish explanations in the future determining that our business is in
an industry subject to the security review, in which case our future acquisitions in the PRC, may be closely scrutinized or prohibited.
Our ability to expand our business or maintain or expand our market share through future acquisitions would as such be materially and
adversely affected. 

58 

It may be difficult to enforce any civil judgments
against us or our board of directors or officers because all of our operating and/or fixed assets are located in the PRC. 

Although we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, all of our
operating and fixed assets are located in the PRC. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments outside the
United States obtained in actions brought against us in the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any state of the United States. In
addition, several of our directors and officers are based in the PRC and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States
upon those directors and officers, or to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or of the securities laws of any
state of the United States. We have been advised by our PRC counsel, Chongqing Jinmujinyang (Jiulongpo) Law Firm (a/k/a in English:
Chongqing Kingmoon Kingyang (Jiulongpo) Law Firm), that, in their opinion, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the PRC,
in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon
the federal securities laws of the United States or the securities laws of any state of the United States. 

Because our assets are located overseas, shareholders
may not receive distributions that they would otherwise be entitled to if we were declared bankrupt or insolvent. 

Because all of our assets are located in the PRC,
they may be outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to administer if we are the subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.
As a result, if we declared bankruptcy or insolvency, our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would
otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the U.S., under U.S. Bankruptcy law. 

Risks Related to Our Company s Common Stock 

We will need to raise additional capital that
will likely cause dilution to our shareholders. 

We believe that we will need to raise additional
capital to fund our ongoing operations, repay our debt and fund future acquisitions. To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt, our shareholders ownership interest will be diluted. 

The trading volume of our Common Stock has
fluctuated from time to time, which may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares at times and prices that investors feel
are appropriate. 

To date, the trading volume of our Common Stock
has fluctuated, sometimes significantly. Generally, lower trading volumes adversely effects the liquidity of our Common Stock, not only
in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions
and reduction in security analysts and the media s coverage of us. This may result in lower prices for our Common Stock
than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our Common Stock. 

The Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing
standards on our Common Stock that we may not be able to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our Common Stock. 

As a listed Nasdaq Capital Market company, we are subject to rules
covering, among other things, certain major corporate transactions, the composition of our Board of Directors and committees thereof,
minimum bid price of our Common Stock and minimum stockholders equity. In order to comply with the minimum bid price rule, we adopted
a 1-for-5 reverse split effective as of February 3, 2022 and a 1-for-10 share reverse-split effective as of December 9, 2022. The failure
to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market requirements may result in the de-listing of our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which
could adversely affect the liquidity and market price thereof. 

If our Common Stock were to be de-listed, selling
shares of our Common Stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions
could be delayed, and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our Common Stock is de-listed,
broker-dealers have certain regulatory requirements imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions
in our Common Stock, further limiting the liquidity thereof. These factors could result in lower prices for shares of our Common Stock
and/or limit an investor s ability to execute a transaction. In addition, delisting from NASDAQ could also greatly impair our ability
to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could lead to significant dilution to our stockholders caused
by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions at a price per share significantly below the then market price. 

59 

Because we have not paid dividends and have
no present intention of paying dividends, investors will not realize any income from an investment in our Common Stock unless and until
investors sell their shares at profit. 

We have never paid any dividends on our Common Stock
and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. Investors will only realize income on an investment in our stock in the
event they sell or otherwise dispose of their shares at a price higher than the price they paid for their shares. Such a gain would result
only from an increase in the market price of our Common Stock, which is uncertain and unpredictable. 

The payment of any future dividends will be at the
discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including future earnings, the success of our business
activities, general financial condition, future prospects, general business conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors
may deem relevant.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

Our executive offices are located at 725 5th Avenue, 15th Floor,
Suite 15-01, New York, NY. In July 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for 4,633 square feet pursuant to a five-year lease with
an annual rental charge of approximately 274,000, subject to a fixed annual increase of two and one-half percent (2.5 ). 

As of December 31, 2022, we operated four pharmacy
stores averaging a little over 200 square meters each in size with one-year lease terms, having an annual aggregate rental charge of
approximately 137,828. At the conclusion of the current leases, we expect to have the ability to renew the leases. On a regular basis
and as part of our normal business, we evaluate store performance and may reduce the size, close or relocate a store if the store is
redundant, underperforming or otherwise deemed unsuitable. In such event, we may continue to have a leasing obligations until the end
of the term of the lease. In September 2021, we closed a pharmacy because of poor performance due to road renovations around the pharmacy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. The discussion in this
section of this Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could
differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to, those discussed in this section, those discussed in Risk Factors and those discussed elsewhere in this Report on Form
10-K. 

Overview 

From 2007 until October 2019, we, through the NF
Group, were engaged in the energy efficiency enhancement business. With the decline in the constructions of power generation plants and
municipal water, gas, heat and energy pipelines in China due to a policy change by the PRC government, the demand for our products and
services declined markedly. As a result, our energy efficiency enhancement business incurred operating losses for seven years, especially
in 2018, when the PRC government adopted a series of policies to favor more environmentally friendly projects and products. Our net loss
from the operation of the energy efficiency enhancement business was 16.79 million in 2018 and 2.18 million in 2019. We explored many
different alternatives in an effort to revive this business, including attempts to expand into international markets, before we determined
this business was not sustainable for us. In late 2019, we committed to a plan to dispose of the NF Group and on March 31, 2020, we entered
into an agreement for the sale of the NF Group. The sale closed on June 23, 2020 when the 10 million sales price was paid to us in full. 

Concurrent with our decision to dispose of the NF
Group, we decided to focus our business activity on the healthcare industry in the PRC. On October 14, 2019, we acquired Boqi Zhengji,
an operator of a pharmacy chain business in the PRC. This was the first step of our shift of focus from the energy sector to the healthcare
business. Boqi Zhengji, however, suffered significant setbacks during 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the pharmacy stores to record
almost no sales for several months due to the national shutdown order and other government orders specifically targeting OTC drugs. While
we offered support to Boqi Zhengji with the implementation of the Boqi Guanzan Healthy Future Pharmacy Plan and other programs aimed
to offer the resources of our other subsidiaries to the pharmacy chain, such efforts failed to help improve Boqi Zhengji s poor
performance. To avoid exposing our other businesses to further risks and potential joint liabilities, we decided to divest the pharmacy
chain. On December 11, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Boqi Zhengji for 1,700,000 in cash. On December 18, 2020, we received
the full consideration from the buyer and the control of the Boqi Zhengji business was transferred. Due to the Chinese government s
alternative working schedule and other delays caused by COVID-19, the government record reflecting the transfer of ownership was not
updated until February 2, 2021. 

The disposal of NF Group and Boqi Zhengji and the
actions taken to fulfill the plans resulted in our classifying the businesses of NF Group and Boqi Zhengji as discontinued operations
according to ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operation. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities
of the NF Group and Boqi Zhengji were reclassified as assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation in the statement of position
as of December 31, 2020, and the results of the operation are presented under the line item net loss from discontinued operations for
the year ended December 31, 2020. 

On March 18, 2020, we completed the Guanzan acquisition.
The rationale for the acquisition was for us to expand our healthcare operation by acquiring a medical devices and pharmaceuticals distribution
business. We believed that Guanzan had strong sales capabilities and procurement resources in the local area of Chongqing, the largest
city in Southwest region of the PRC. The acquisition was in line with our expansion strategy, which focuses on deeper penetration of
the healthcare market in the Southwest region of China and gaining a wider footprint in the PRC. On April 9, 2021, we increased our equity
interest in Shude from 80 to 95.2 by making a direct capital investment in Shude. 

63 

On February 2, 2021, we acquired Guoyitang, the
owner and operator of a private general hospital in Chongqing with 50 hospital beds and 98 employees, including 14 doctors, 28 nurses,
43 other medical staff and 13 non-medical staff. The Guoyitang acquisition was the first step in our efforts to build a hospital chain
specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. 

On February 8, 2021, we acquired Zhongshan, a private
hospital in the southeast region of China with 160 hospital beds (of which 110 beds are currently in use) and 95 employees, including
20 doctors, 48 nurses, 10 other medical staff and 17 non-medical staff. Zhongshan is a general hospital known for its complex minimally
invasive surgeries and equipped with high-end diagnostics equipment and surgical instruments for gynecology and obstetrics use. The Zhongshan
acquisition marked the second step in our effort to establish a nationwide hospital chain specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. 

On April 9, 2021, we acquired Qiangsheng, Eurasia
and Minkang hospitals, three private hospitals in the south, northern and southwest region of China, respectively. Qiangsheng has 20
hospital beds and 63 employees, including 18 doctors, 17 nurses, 8 other medical staff and 20 non-medical staff. Eurasia has 12 hospital
beds and 52 employees, including 12 doctors, 15 nurses, 7 other medical staff and 18 non-medical staff. Minkang has 126 hospital beds
and 116 employees, including 24 doctors, 58 nurses, 12 other medical staff and 22 non-medical staff. The three hospitals acquisition
marked the third step in our effort to establish a nationwide hospital chain specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. 

On September 10, 2021, we acquired Zhuoda, a company
engaged in the distribution of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, based in Chongqing, the largest city in Southwest region of the PRC.
The Zhuoda acquisition marked the second step in our effort to further penetrate the healthcare market in southwest China. 

In response to the poor performance of Zhuoda
since its acquisition, whose operations were impacted by COVID-19, on October 19, 2022, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement
to sell Zhuoda back to the former owners. Pursuant to the agreement, we sold 100 of the equity interests in Zhuoda in consideration
for the return of the 44,000 shares of Common Stock previously issued to the former owners of Zhuoda. The transaction closed effective
November 23, 2022, when 100 of the equity interests in Zhuoda were transferred to the former owners and the 440,000 shares of Common
Stock were returned to us. 

Our hospitals performed poorly in 2022 due in great
measure to the impact of COVID-19 and the PRC s policies to combat its spread. In response to the poor performance of Zhongshan,
on December 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement to transfer 87 of the equity interests in Zhongshan to the seller. As consideration
for the transfer, the seller will return to us 40,037 shares of Common Stock, which were previously issued to the seller as part of the
closing consideration for Zhongshan. 

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. 

In response to the poor performance of the Qiangsheng,
Eurasia and Minkang hospitals, on December 28, 2022 we entered into an agreement to transfer 90 of the equity interests in the three
hospitals back to the sellers. As consideration for the transfer, the sellers will return to us 80,000 shares of Common Stock, which
were previously issued to them upon the acquisition of the hospitals. Pursuant to the agreement, we will continue to own 10 of the equity
interests in each of the three hospitals. The sales of Qiangsheng, Minkang and Eurasia are expected to close in the second quarter of
2023. 

The actions taken to fulfill the plans to dispose
of the majority of our ownership interests in the Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang hospitals resulted in our classifying these
hospitals as held for sale operations according to ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operation. As
a result, all of the assets and liabilities of the Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang hospitals were reclassified as assets and
liabilities of a held for sale operation in the statement of position as of December 31, 2022, and the results of the operation are presented
under the line item net loss from held for sale operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

64 

We have restated our financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2021, to correct errors identified in our prior financial statements. In FY2021, we recorded amortization of convertible note in G A
expense account, it has been revised to record amortization of convertible note in other income(expense) account. The restatement was
necessary to address misstatement of financial statements. The impact of the restatement on our financial statement is reclassification
of other expense in financial statements. We have concluded that the restatement does not materially affect our liquidity or our compliance
with debt covenants or other financial obligations. 

We have taken steps to address the cause of the restatement and to
improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We hired a consulting firm to assist us on daily internal controls and financial
reporting process review. And we also improved our internal accounting department management as well. We are committed to maintaining
the integrity of our financial statements and to providing accurate and transparent financial information to our investors. 

Going Concern Uncertainties 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge
of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of approximately 22.32 million and
 34.92 million, respectively. In addition, we reported a cash outflow of 2.27 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. As of
December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 70.14 million. Management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The continuation of our company as a going concern through the
next twelve months is dependent upon (1) the continued financial support from our stockholders or external financing. Management
believes that our existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet our obligations as they become due, and (2) that we
will be able to implement our business plan to expand our company s operations and generate sufficient revenues to meet our
obligations. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to increase sales volume and in our ability to raise additional
funds, there can be no assurance to that effect, nor that our company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the
operations. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about our
company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from
the outcome of these uncertainties. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement
its strategic plan provides the opportunity for our company to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
including those related to revenue, receivable, inventory, and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known
trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they
become known. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

65 

Revenue Recognition 

We adopted Accounting Standard Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenues from Contract with Customers ASC 606 for all periods presented. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized
when control of the promised goods and services is transferred to the Company s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration
that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services, net of value-added tax. We determine revenue recognition through
the following steps: 

Identify
the contract with a customer; 

Identify
the performance obligations in the contract; 

Determine
the transaction price; 

Allocate
the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 

Recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized
when that performance obligation is satisfied by the control of the promised goods and services is transferred to the customers, which
at a point in time or over time as appropriate. 

Our revenues are net of value added tax VAT collected on behalf of PRC tax authorities in respect to the sales of merchandise. VAT collected from customers, net of VAT paid for
purchases, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until it is paid to the relevant PRC tax authorities. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts 

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced
amount and do not bear interest, which are due within contractual payment terms, generally 30 to 90 days from delivery. Credit is extended
based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition, the customer credit-worthiness and their payment history. Accounts receivable
outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount
are reviewed individually for collectability. At the end of each period, we specifically evaluate individual customer s financial
condition, credit history, and the current economic conditions to monitor the progress of the collection of accounts receivables. We
will consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required
payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust
all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance
after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet
credit exposure related to its customers. 

Leases 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards
Update ASU 2016-02. For all leases that were entered into prior to the effective date of ASC 842, we elected to apply
the package of practical expedients. Based on this guidance, we did not reassess the following: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts
are or contain leases; (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (3) initial direct costs for any existing
leases. 

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, current portion of obligations under operating
leases, and obligations under operating leases, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property
and equipment, net, current portion of obligations under capital leases, and obligations under capital leases, non-current on our consolidated
balance sheets. 

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date, adjusted by
the deferred rent liabilities at the adoption date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease
ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The terms may include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

66 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration
paid of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill
is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually, more often when circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. If impairment exists, goodwill is immediately written off to its fair
value and the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Impairment losses on goodwill are
not reversed. 

The Company reviews the carrying value of intangible
assets not subject to amortization, including goodwill, to determine whether impairment may exist annually or more frequently if events
and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. The Company has the opinion to assess qualitative
factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step in accordance with ASC 350-20. If the Company believes, as a result
of the qualitative carrying amount, the two-step quantities impairment test described below is required. 

The first step compares the fair values of each
reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill
is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. 

If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business acquisition with the allocation of
the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value
of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimating fair
value is performed by utilizing various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow. The fair value
of discounted cash flow was determined using management s estimates and assumptions. 

Management evaluated the recoverability of goodwill
by performing a qualitative assessment before using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. If the Company reorganizes
its reporting structure in a manner that changes the composition of one or more of its reporting units, goodwill will be reassigned based
on the relative fair value of each of the affected reporting units. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded impairments
for goodwill of 5,385,811 and 26,128,171, respectively. 

At the date of the most recent annual goodwill impairment test, all
the reporting units fair value were either equal to or slightly higher than their carrying values. None of the reporting units 
fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the goodwill associated with each of the Guanzan
Group (which covers the wholesale pharmaceutical, wholesale medical devices and the Lijiantang Pharmacies segments) and the medical services
segment (consisting of Guoyitang, Zhongshan and the Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang hospitals), were equal to their carrying value after
their last impairment test and the fair value of the goodwill for Zhuoda only exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5.62 .
Accordingly, the goodwill associated with , Guanzan Group, Guoyitang, Zhongshan and Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang are considered at
risk for impairment in future periods. The sale of Zhongshan is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. The sales of Qiangsheng,
Minkang and Eurasia are expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. 

The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted
estimated future income statement. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s estimates of future growth
rates, operating revenue, and discount rates. We disclose the methodology used to determine the fair values of our reporting units for
our annual impairment review as using the income approach. 

All of our reporting units share similar characteristics
due to the nature of their businesses and operating model. As a result, the methodology used to determine fair value and the key estimates
and assumptions used in our annual goodwill review are consistent for all of our reporting units. 

Our key assumptions used includes revenue growth,
profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates, other assumptions deemed
reasonable by the management and relevant comparable to similar industry. 

We believe that the estimates and assumptions made
are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors
will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration
in profitability, adverse market conditions, changes in regulatory developments, changes in category growth rates as a result of changing
consumer preferences, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit and competitive activity or
a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the assumption and estimation
in calculating the fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future. 

Potential events and changes in circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions are general economic conditions, regulatory developments, changes
in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion
of a reporting unit and competitive activity.

Businesses Held for Sale 

In late 2022, we committed to a plan to dispose
of the Zhongshan, Minkang, Eurasia, Qiangsheng and Guoyitang hospitals. 

On December 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement
to transfer 87 of the equity interests in Zhongshan to the prior owner. As consideration for the transfer, the seller agreed to return
to us the 40,037 shares of Common Stock, that were previously issued as part of the closing consideration. The transaction is expected
to close in the second quarter of 2023. 

On December 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement to transfer 90 
of the equity interests in Qiangsheng, Minkang and Eurasia to the previous owners. As consideration for the transfer, the sellers agreed
to return to us the 80,000 shares of Common Stock which were previously issued upon the acquisition of the three hospitals. The sales
of Qiangsheng, Minkang and Eurasia are expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. 

The Company determined that the plan and the subsequent
actions taken to dispose of the four hospitals qualified as a held for sale operation under the criteria set forth in the ASC 205-20
Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operation.

Convertible Promissory Notes 

We record debt net of debt discount for beneficial
conversion features and warrants, on a relative fair value basis. Beneficial conversion features are recorded pursuant to the Beneficial
Conversion and Debt Topics of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The amounts allocated to warrants and beneficial conversion
rights are recorded as debt discount and as additional paid-in-capital. Debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of
the debt. 

Beneficial Conversion Feature 

We evaluate the conversion feature of the convertible
debt that we issue to determine whether it was beneficial as described in ASC 470-20. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature
inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible notes payable and may
not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible notes payable. This discount is amortized over the
period from the date of issuance to the date the notes is due using the effective interest method. If the notes payable are retired prior
to the end of their contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general,
the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of
detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the shares of common stock at the commitment
date to be received upon conversion.

Derivative Instruments 

We enter into financing arrangements that consist
of freestanding derivative instruments or are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features. We account for these arrangements
in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification topic 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC
815 as well as related interpretation of this standard. In accordance with this standard, derivative instruments are recognized
as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured at fair values with gains or losses recognized in earnings. Embedded
derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes
in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings. We determine the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments
based on available market data using appropriate valuation models, giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument. 

We estimate fair values of derivative financial instruments
using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered to be consistent with the objective measuring fair values. In
selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies
and the expected means of settlement. For less complex derivative instruments, such as free-standing warrants, we generally use the Black-Scholes
model, adjusted for the effect of dilution, because it embodies all of the requisite assumptions (including trading volatility, estimated
terms, dilution and risk free rates) necessary to fair value these instruments. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments
requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument
with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques (such as Black-Scholes model) are highly
volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of our Common Stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially
and subsequently carried at fair values, our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption
changes. Under the terms of the new accounting standard, increases in the trading price of the Common Stock and increases in fair value
during a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative expense. Conversely, decreases in the trading price
of the Common Stock and decreases in trading fair value during a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative
income. 

Foreign Currencies Translation 

Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency
using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.
The reporting currency of our company is the United States Dollar ). Our subsidiaries in the PRC maintain their books
and records in their local currency, the Renminbi Yuan RMB ), which is the functional currency as it is the primary currency
of the economic environment in which these entities operate. 

In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and
liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the are translated into , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation
of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded
as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.

Revenues 

Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and
2021 were 11,830,379 and 21,319,610, respectively. The decrease of 9,489,231 is mainly due to the 10,712,363 decrease in sales of
wholesale pharmaceuticals, the 1,048,318 decline in medical services revenues, offset in part by the 697,348 increase in medical devices
revenues and the 539,949 increase in pharmacy retail revenues. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the revenues
of the retail pharmacies, wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and medical services were 856,596, 4,142,455, 6,831,328
and Nil, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the revenues of the retail pharmacies, wholesale medical devices, wholesale
pharmaceuticals and medical services were 316,647, 3,445,107, 16,495,373 and 1,048,318, respectively. 

As the Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang
were held for sale as of December 31, 2022, the revenues of these hospital amounting to 5,446,619 are not included. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues consists of primarily of the
cost of the medical devices, pharmaceuticals and other products sold to customers. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31,
2022 was 9,880,429 compared with 18,893,667 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to the four hospitals
(Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang) that were held for sale are accounted for
separately. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the cost of revenues of Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang were
 2,644,003.

wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and medical services for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 179,386,

medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and medical services for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 200,162, 3,033,702, 14,553,641
and 1,000,582, respectively. 

71 

Gross profit 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 we had a gross
profit margin of 16 compared with a gross profit margin of 11 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the gross profit
margin in 2022 was mainly due to the increase in the gross profit margin of the retail pharmaceuticals segment from 36.8 in 2021 to 79 
in 2022 caused by a change in the product mix. In addition, in 2022,some suppliers to our retail pharmacies provided significant promotions
and discounts. 

The gross profit margin of our retail pharmacies,
wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and medical services segments for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 79.1 , 21.0 ,
8.5 and 51.5 , respectively. The gross profit margin of our retail pharmacies, wholesale medical devices, wholesale pharmaceuticals and
medical services segments for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 36.8 , 12.0 , 2.7 and 57.3 , respectively. 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses consist mainly of the impairment loss of goodwill,
general and administrative expenses including auditing and legal service fees, other professional service fees and promotional expenses.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted mainly of general and administrative expenses of 10,599,818 and selling
expenses in the amount of 1,302,775. The Company recorded an impairment loss of goodwill of 5,385,811. 

Operating expenses were 17,288,404 for the
year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 34,337,960 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 17,049,556, or 50 ,
primarily due to the decrease in goodwill impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2022. The goodwill impairment charge in
2022 was mainly attributable to the Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang hospitals which were held for sale in 2022. Operating expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted mainly of general and administrative expenses of 10,599,818, selling expenses in the
amount of 1,302,775. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairment loss of goodwill of 5,385,811, respectively.

Operating expenses of the wholesale medical devices segment for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 510,637 and 633,241, respectively. The decrease in 2022 of 122,604 is attributable to the
influence of the epidemic control policy. The operation hours of Hu Zhong Tang, a subsidiary of Guoyitang, in 2022 were relatively short
and the expenses were greatly reducing. 

Operating expenses of the wholesale pharmaceuticals
segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 2,192,312 and 190,359, respectively; the reasons for the decrease are the
establishment of a bad debt allowance of 1.4 million in accounts receivable and the increase of 0.7 million in expenses due to the full
operation of Pusheng in 2022. 

Operating expenses of the retail pharmacies segment
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 592,973 and 681,140, respectively. The decrease in 2022 was attributable to improved
internal management and controls. 

Operating expenses of the medical services segment
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 68,669 and 956,021, respectively. The decline in 2022 was attributable to the imposition
of the PRC government s COVID-19 control policy, Guoyitang only opened for a short period of time in 2022, resulting in a sharp
drop in costs. The decrease in 2022 was attributable to the held for sale status of Zhongshan, Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang, which
are accounted for separately.

this expense related to the amortization of the convertible notes and also included 1,799,671 of penalties in 2022 relating to the
convertible notes. No penalties were assessed in 2021. 

In 2022, the exchange rate of Chinese RMB to US dollars
decreased from 1 = 6.3757 to 1 = 6.9646. Since substantially all of our assets and revenues are denominated in RMB,
we reported an exchange loss of 6,583 for the year ended December 31, 2022, taking into consideration of such exchange rate change and
exchange gains/losses related to non-currency assets and liabilities, compared to exchange gains of 24,967 for the year ended December
31, 2021.

(a) 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 

Our chief executive officer and interim chief financial
officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on
the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, based on the material weaknesses described
below. 

(b) 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of our company; 

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with management authorization;
and 

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

78 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. 

Based on this assessment, our management concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 

In connection with the assessment described above,
management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at December 31, 2022: 

We
 have restated our financial statements for year ended December 31, 2021 to correct errors
 identified in our prior financial statements. The impact of the restatement on our financial statement is a reclassification of other expense
 in financial statements. We have concluded that the restatement does not materially affect
 our liquidity or our compliance with debt covenants or other financial obligations. 

Due to our limited resources, we do not have enough accounting personnel with extensive experience in maintaining books and records and preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which could lead to untimely identification and resolution of accounting matters inherent in our financial transactions in accordance with US GAAP. 

The Company has insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which led to inadequate financial statement closing process. 

Based on the above factors, management
concluded that the control deficiency over accounting and finance personnel was the material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022, as our
accounting staff continues to lack sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and requires further substantial training. 

We have taken steps to address the cause of the restatement and to
improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We hired a consulting firm to assist our accounting department on internal controls
and financial reporting. We are committed to maintaining the integrity of our financial statements and to providing accurate and transparent
financial information to our investors. 

Management s Remediation Plan 

We expect to implement the following measures in
2023 to continue to remediate the material weaknesses identified: 

To establish additional written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to improve the Company s financial statement closing process. 

To continue providing applicable training for our financial and accounting staff to enhance their understanding of U.S. GAAP and internal control over financial reporting. 

To continue providing applicable training for our accounting manager to improve our internal review process. 

We hired a consulting firm to assist our accounting
department on internal controls and financial reporting since July of 2022. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the exemption provided to issuers that are neither large
accelerated filers nor accelerated filers under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

(c) 
 Changes in Internal Controls 

No change in our internal control over financial
reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

None. 

ITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS
THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS 

In December 2022, the PCAOB announced that it
has secured complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong
and confirmed that until such time as the PCAOB issues any new determination, there are no Commission-Identified Issuers at risk of having
their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCAA.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 

BIMI International Medical, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of BIMI International Medical, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2021, and related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2022 and 2021 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company incurred a net loss of 22,393,259 and 34,985,956 and recorded a cash outflow from operating activities of 10,255,206 and
 4,436,774 for the financial years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company in net
current liabilities of 2,126,672 and 932,492 and had accumulated deficit of 70,143,785and 47,900,930, respectively. These factors
indicate material uncertainty exists that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to this matter are also discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion
on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F- 2 

Goodwill Refer to Note 4,5,6,7,8 and
18 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

As described in Notes 4,5,6,7,8 and 18 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company acquired the Guanzan Group in 2020 and acquired the Guoyitang Hospital, the Zhongshan Hospital, the
Qiangsheng, Eurasia and Minkang Hospitals and Zhuoda in 2021. Zhuoda has been stripped off on October 31,2022, so there is no goodwill
of Zhuoda for impairment assessment in 2022. The goodwill associated with the acquisition of: (i) Guanzan of 6,914,232; (ii) Guoyitang
of 7,154,393; (iii) Zhongshan of 10,443,494, and (iv) Minkang, Qiangsheng and Eurasia of 9,067,529, were initially recognized at the
acquisition closing date. 

Management assessed goodwill for potential impairment
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated with
the recoverable amount determined by assessing the value-in-use VIU by preparing a discounted cash flow forecast. Preparing
a discounted cash flow forecast involves the exercise of significant management judgement, in particular in forecasting revenue growth
and operating profit and in determining an appropriate discount rate. 

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The Company has elected to perform quantitative
assessment. In the quantitative assessment, the Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the
fair value to the carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to
make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating margins. Changes
in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge. Based on
the quantitative assessment performed, if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. During the
year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, impairment losses on goodwill in the amount of 5,385,811 and 26,128,171 were recognized based
on the quantitative assessment performed, respectively. 

We identified goodwill impairment as a critical
audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the acquired companies and the difference
between the fair value and carrying value. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased efforts, including the need
to involve our valuation specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates
and assumptions related to selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in
the Audit 

Our audit procedures relating to the discount rate
and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin used by management to estimate the fair value of the acquired companies included
the following, among others: 

We
 evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and operating
 margins by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. 

We
 evaluated the reasonableness of management s revenue and operating margin forecasts
 by comparing the forecasts to historical revenues and operating margins. 

With
 the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation
 methodology and (2) discount rate by: 

a. Testing
 the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical
 accuracy of the calculation; 

b. Developing
 a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

We have served as the Company s auditor since
2020.
