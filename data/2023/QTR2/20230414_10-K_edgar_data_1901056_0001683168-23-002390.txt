Forward-Looking Statements 

This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements about our plans, objectives, expectations,
assumptions or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, 
 estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, 
 we believe, we intend, may, should, will, could and
similar expressions denoting uncertainty or an action that may, will or is expected to occur in the future. These statements involve estimates,
assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future
results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. 

Examples of forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to: 

the anticipated timing of the development of future products; 

projections of costs, revenue, earnings, capital structure and other financial items; 

statements of our plans and objectives; 

statements regarding the capabilities of our business operations; 

statements of expected future economic performance; 

statements regarding competition in our market; and 

assumptions underlying statements regarding us or our business. 

Forward-looking statements are neither historical
facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding
the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances
that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially
from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important
factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements
include, among others, the following: 

our ability to manage our current and projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate, including our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements, and ultimately our ability to continue as a going concern; 

Our ability to raise additional capital to further develop and expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives. We have limited revenues and we cannot predict when we will achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability; 

our ability to achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability; 

changes in customer demand; 

our ability to develop our brands cost-effectively, to attract new customers and retain customers on a cost-effective basis ; 

our ability to compete in the markets in which our websites participate; 

our ability to make strategic actions, including acquisitions and dispositions and our success in integrating acquired businesses; 

our ability to continue to successfully manage our websites on a combined basis ; 

security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; 

security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; 

developments and changes in laws and regulations, including increased regulation of our industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards; 

the occurrence of hostilities, political instability or catastrophic events; 

the coronavirus COVID-19 and its potential impact on our business; and 

natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes, or man-made or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this
Report on Form 10-K is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as
a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

The Company operates these wells as a licensed
operator in the State of Kentucky. These wells are located on six (6) leases located in Kentucky (the Leases ). 

Our plan is to continue to develop the above-mentioned
oil wells within the next twelve (12) months and to increase the oil production by enhancement procedures. Further, our plan is to start
a drilling program to drill eight (8) new wells within the coming twenty-four months.

The following chart provides an overview of our
budgeted expenditures by significant area of activity over the next twelve (12) months as well over the next twenty-four (24) months,
assuming we are able to attract sufficient debt or equity financing. We anticipate that we shall need to raise an additional 682,100
in debt or equity financing in the next twelve (12) months to meet our objectives and execute our business plan. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to attract financing and we may be required to scale back operations accordingly.

The interests in the wells are the subject of pending litigation. While the litigation is expected to be concluded shortly, there is
no guarantee that access to the accumulated oil or the revenues from the sale of the accumulated oil will be accessible and what amounts
will be available to the Company during this time. 

Since our oil wells and proposed drill sites are located on unproven reserves, we are prohibited from providing any estimates of revenue
or resources.

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 

We do not anticipate dependence on one or a few
major customers for at least the next twelve (12) months or the foreseeable future. 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive
and changing federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, wildlife protection, historic
preservation and health and safety. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards,
and we expect that this trend will continue. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 

require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations before
construction, drilling and certain other activities; 

require environmental reviews and assessments of proposed actions
prior to the issuance of permits or the granting of governmental approvals; 

limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities
on specified lands within wilderness and other protected areas; and 

impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our
operations. 

The various environmental permits required for
our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power
to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. We believe that we are in substantial compliance
with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing
environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could have
a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. The following is a summary of the more significant
existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may
have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites
and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon
for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural
resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 

The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize
the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for non-compliance, as well as requirements for corrective act ions. Although CERCLA
currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operations may impose
clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes
as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes
subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up
of sites and disposal of substances found on drilling and production sites long after operations on such sites have been completed. 

Other statutes relating to the storage and handling
of pollutants include the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which requires certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise
handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The OPA, contains
numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. State laws
mandate oil cleanup programs with respect to contaminated soil. A failure to comply with OPA s requirements or inadequate cooperation
during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions. 

7 

The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, seeks to ensure
that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, or destroy or modify the critical habitat of
such species. Under the ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair
or jeopardize the species or its habitat. The ESA has been used to prevent or delay drilling activities and provides for criminal penalties
for willful violations of its provisions. 

Other statutes that provide protection to animal
and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, without limitation, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Although we believe that
our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as
threatened or endangered or re-determination of the extent of critical habit could subject us to significant expenses to
modify our operations or could force us to discontinue some operations altogether. 

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA,
requires a thorough review of the environmental impacts of major federal actions and a determination of whether proposed
actions on federal and certain Indian lands would result in significant impact on the environment. For purposes of NEPA,
 major federal action can be something as basic as issuance of a required permit. For oil and gas operations on federal and
certain Indian lands or requiring federal permits, NEPA review can increase the time for obtaining approval and impose additional regulatory
burdens on the natural gas and oil industry, thereby increasing our costs of doing business and our profitability. 

The Clean Water Act, or CWA, and comparable state
statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into
waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a
permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water run-off from oil
and natural gas facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility
to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. 

The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder
also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately
issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges
for oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental
damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and the
Underground Injection Control (UIC) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells.
EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state.
The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of
groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs,
among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other
parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 

Our operations employ hydraulic fracturing techniques
to stimulate natural gas production from unconventional geological formations, which entails the injection of pressurized fracturing fluids
into a well bore. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the SDWA to exclude hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground
injection under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations
and others in the public. Legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption and require federal permitting and regulatory control
of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the
fracturing process, has been introduced in the current session of Congress. 

8 

The U.S. Department of the Interior has announced
that it will consider regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing
fluid constituents. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances
that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas
production. If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements
could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing
and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. It is also possible that our drilling and injection operations could adversely
affect the environment, which could result in a requirement to perform investigations or clean-ups or in the incurrence of other unexpected
material costs or liabilities. 

The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts the emission
of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can
begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. In addition, more stringent regulations
governing emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases such as methane (a component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide are
being developed by the federal government, and may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities or the cost of transportation
or processing of produced oil and natural gas which may affect our operating costs. Legislation targeting air emissions from hydraulic
fracturing activities has been introduced in the current session of Congress and if passed may increase our costs of compliance and doing
business. In addition, the EPA has promulgated more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from sources in
the oil and gas industry, and these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. 

Significant studies and research have been devoted
to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally.
Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific
research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. 

Many state governments have enacted legislation
directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future state and federal legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions
or requirements in connection with our operations and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could increase operating costs and
demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted
at controlling climate change. 

We are subject to a number of federal and state
laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (OSHA), and comparable state laws, whose purpose
is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations
under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained
concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local
government authorities and citizens. 

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations
relating to preservation and protection of historical and cultural resources. Such laws include the National Historic Preservation Act,
the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and the Paleontological Resources
Preservation Act, and their state counterparts and similar statutes, which require certain assessments and mitigation activities if historical
or cultural resources are impacted by our activities and provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions
for violation of their requirements. 

9 

We do not believe that our environmental, health
and safety risks are materially different from those of comparable companies in the United States in the oil and natural gas industry.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment
of production or material increase in the cost of production, development or exploration or otherwise adversely affect our capital expenditures,
financial condition and results of operations. 

We have acquired, and may in the future acquire,
interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others and may be liable for environmental damage, including historical
contamination, caused by such former operators. Additional liabilities could also arise from continuing violations or contamination not
discovered during our assessment of the acquired properties. We have not incurred, and do not currently anticipate incurring, any material
capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

We currently do not have any patents or trademarks;
and we are not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements or any labor contracts. 

Employees 

Our only employees are our two (2) executive officers
and our President and Director.

10 

Board Composition 

Our Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors
shall consist of no less than 1, but not more than 9 directors. Each director serves until his successor is elected and qualified. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

We do not presently have a separately constituted
audit committee, compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors.
Nor do we have an audit committee financial expert. As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and
handles matters related to compensation and nominations of directors. 

Potential Conflicts of Interest 

Since we do not have an audit or compensation
committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors.
Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management
compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our
executives or directors. 

Director Independence 

We are not subject to listing requirements of
any national securities exchange or national securities association and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our board
comprised of a majority of independent directors. Our determination of independence of directors is made using the definition
of independent director contained in Rule 4200(a) (15) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market NASDAQ ),
even though such definitions do not currently apply to us because we are not listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that none of our directors
currently meet the definition of independent as within the meaning of such rules as a result of their current positions
as our executive officers. 

Significant Employees 

We have no other significant employees other than
the executive officers/directors described above. 

Family Relationships 

There are no familial relationships between our
officers and directors. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

No director, person nominated to become a director,
executive officer, promoter or control person of our company has, during the last ten years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject
to a pending a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of
a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree
or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking
or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation
with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive
officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto. 

11 

Stockholder Communications with the Board 

We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure
by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that
the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are
provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered
it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue
to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process. 

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance 

16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires
the Company directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company s common stock, to file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes of ownership of our common stock. Officers,
directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a)
forms they file. The Company intends to ensure to the best of our ability that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its
officers, directors and greater than ten percent (10 beneficial owners are complied with in a timely fashion. 

ITEM 1A. 

 RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our common stock involves
a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information in this prospectus before deciding
to invest in our Company. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
for growth could be seriously harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part
of your investment. 

Risks Relating to Our Business 

There is uncertainty regarding our ability
to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may be required to curtail or discontinue our operations in the future.
If we discontinue our operations, you may lose all of your investment. 

We have an accumulated deficit of 530,887 as
of December 31, 2022, and have completed only the preliminary stages of our business plan. We anticipate incurring additional losses before
realizing any revenues and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing from outside sources and eventually produce enough revenues, we may be forced to sell
our assets, or curtail or discontinue our operations. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment. 

We are in an early stage of development. If
we are not able to develop our business as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability and you may lose
your investment. 

We were incorporated on March 18, 2020. We are
in an early stage of development and have earned limited revenues to date. Our business prospects are difficult to predict because of
our limited operating history, early stage of development, and unproven business strategy. We expect to continue to incur operating losses
for the foreseeable future, and such losses may be substantial. Given our history of operating losses, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to achieve or maintain operating profitability on an annual or quarterly basis or at all. If we are unable to execute our business
plan as anticipated, we may not be able to generate revenues or achieve profitability and you may lose your investment. 

12 

We expect to suffer losses in the immediate
future that may cause us to curtail or discontinue our operations. 

We expect to incur operating losses in future
periods. These losses will occur because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with the development of our
business operations, generally. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. We recognize
that if we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which
to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will
generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business
will almost certainly fail. 

We have limited sales and marketing experience,
which increases the risk that our business will fail. 

Our officers, who will be responsible for marketing,
have only nominal sales and marketing experience. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Further, if our initial
efforts to create a market are not successful, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified individuals
with marketing and sales expertise to attract customer. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our products
and services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. 

We may not be able to execute our business
plan or stay in business without additional funding. 

Our ability to generate future operating revenues
depends in part on whether we can obtain the financing necessary to implement our business plan. We will likely require additional financing
through the issuance of debt and/or equity in order to establish profitable operations, and such financing may not be forthcoming. As
widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and constraints
continue or if there is no investor appetite to finance our specific business, we may not be able to acquire additional financing through
credit markets or equity markets. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms favorable to us. At this
time, we have not identified or secured sources of additional financing. Our failure to secure additional financing when it becomes required
will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business. 

If our estimates related to future expenditures
are erroneous or inaccurate, our business will fail and you could lose your entire investment. 

Our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy
of our management s estimates of our future cost expenditures for legal and accounting services (including those we expect to incur
as a publicly reporting company), for research and development, construction, marketing, and for administrative expenses over the next
twelve (12) months. If such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate, or if we encounter unforeseen costs, we may not be able to carry out
our business plan, which could result in the failure of our business and the loss of your entire investment. 

Our auditor has raised substantial doubts about
our ability to continue as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business, our shares may have little or no value. 

Our ability to become a profitable operating company
is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues and/or obtain financing adequate to fulfill its research and market introduction activities,
and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as
a going concern. We plan to attempt to raise additional equity capital by selling shares, if necessary, through one or more private placement
or public offerings. However, the doubts raised, relating to our ability to continue as a going concern, may make our shares an unattractive
investment for potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it difficult to raise any additional capital. 

13 

We are a small company with limited resources
relative to our competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively. 

Our competitors have longer operating histories,
greater resources and name recognition, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors will have greater
credibility with our potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources
to the development, promotion, and sale of their services than we may be able to devote to our services. Therefore, we may not be able
to compete effectively and our business may fail. 

The loss of the services of any of our officers
or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our
services. 

The development of our business will continue
to place a significant strain on our limited personnel, management, and other resources. Our future success depends upon the continued
services of our executive officers, Joachim Haas, our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director, and Achim Weber, our Chief Financial
Officer, who are developing our business, and on our ability to identify and retain competent consultants and employees with the skills
required to execute our business objectives. The loss of the services of any of our officers or our failure to timely identify and retain
competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our services, which could adversely affect our
financial results and impair our growth. 

Our Chief Executive Officer, President, and
Chief Financial Officer have conflicts of interest in that they have other time commitments that will prevent them from devoting full-time
to our operations, which may affect our operations. 

Because our Chief Executive Officer, and President,
Joachim Haas, and our Chief Financial Officer, Achim Weber, only devote approximately fifty percent (50 of their full working time to
operation and management of us, the implementation of our business plans may be impeded. Mr. Haas, and Mr. Weber have limited time in
which to devote to our operations, which may slow our operations and may reduce our financial results and as a result, we may not be able
to continue with our operations. Additionally, if Mr. Haas, and Mr. Weber became unable to handle their daily duties of the Chief Executive
Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer on their own, we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel to replace them
in a timely manner. If this event should occur, we may not be able to reach profitability, which might result in the loss of some or all
of your investment in our common stock. 

Some of our Officers reside outside the United States and initiating
or maintaining a claim against them may be difficult and costly. 

Our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director,
Mr. Haas as well the CFO, Mr. Weber, reside and are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult and costly
for investors to initiate or maintain a claim against these individuals or obtain jurisdiction over them in the United States. 

Risks related to our US operations. 

Part of our strategy involves drilling in existing
or emerging shale plays using available drilling and completion techniques. The results of our planned exploratory and development drilling
in these plays are subject to drilling and completion technique risks and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves
or production. As a result, we may incur material write-downs and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline if drilling results
are unsuccessful. Our current working capital, together with cash generated from anticipated production, may not be sufficient to support
all planned exploration and development opportunities, our debt service obligation and our other contractual obligations. 

14 

We may not be able to successfully drill wells
that produce oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities. We cannot assure you that each well we drill will produce commercial
quantities of oil and natural gas. The total cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is uncertain before drilling commences.
Overruns in budgeted expenditures are a common risk that can make a particular project uneconomical. The use of seismic data and other
technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling each well whether
oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Our use of seismic
data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of natural gas and oil. Further, many factors may curtail,
delay or cancel drilling, including the following: 

delays and restrictions imposed by or resulting from compliance
with regulatory requirements; 

changes in laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural
gas activities; 

hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental
conditions; 

shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; 

equipment failures or accidents; 

adverse weather conditions; 

reductions in oil and natural gas prices; 

land title problems; 

lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction
of gathering facilities; 

unanticipated transportation costs and delays; and 

limitations in the market for oil and natural gas. 

Any of these risks can cause substantial losses,
and some may entail personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution,
environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties. The occurrence of any of these events could negatively affect
our ability to successfully drill wells that produce oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities. 

We may not adhere to our proposed drilling schedule. 

Our final determination of whether to drill any
scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including: 

the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and
crews; 

economic and industry conditions; 

prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas; 

the availability of sufficient capital resources; 

the results of our exploitation efforts; and 

our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations. 

We have historically incurred losses and cannot
assure investors as to future profitability. 

The actual expected quantities and present value
of our reserves may be lower than we have estimated. In addition, the present value of future net revenues from our reserves will not
necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Properties that we have acquired and
that we may acquire in the future may not produce oil or natural gas as projected, and we may be unable to successfully determine reserve
potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them, which could cause us to
incur losses. 

15 

Our business involves numerous operating hazards
and exposure to significant weather and climate risks. We have not insured and cannot fully insure against all risks related to our operations,
which could result in substantial claims for which we are underinsured or uninsured. 

We have not insured and cannot fully insure against
all risks and have not attempted to insure fully against risks where the cost of available coverage is excessive relative to the perceived
risks 

 presented. In addition, certain pollution and
environmental risks generally are not insurable. Our exploration, drilling and other activities are subject to risks such as: 

adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other environmental
disturbances; 

fires and explosions; 

environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural
gas, oil, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination; 

abnormally pressured formations; 

mechanical failures of drilling equipment; 

personal injuries and death, including insufficient worker compensation
coverage for third-party contractors who provide drilling services; and 

acts of terrorism. 

In particular, our operations in Kentucky and
our possible future operations in Alabama are or will be conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions and often in difficult
terrain. Primarily in the winter and spring, our operations are often curtailed because of cold, snow and wet conditions. Unusually severe
weather could further curtail these operations, including drilling of new wells or production from existing wells, and depending on the
severity of the weather, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
weather conditions and other events could temporarily impair our ability to transport our oil and natural gas production. 

We do not carry business interruption insurance
coverage. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events, which could arise from even one catastrophic accident,
could reduce the funds available for our exploration, development and production activities and could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our interests are held in the form of leases
that we may be unable to retain and the title to our properties may be defective. 

Our properties are held under leases and working
interests in leases. If we or the holder of a lease fails to meet the specific requirements of the lease regarding delay rental payments,
continuous production or development, or similar terms, portions of the lease may terminate or expire. There can be no assurance that
any of the obligations required to maintain each lease will be met. The termination or expiration of our leases or the working interests
relating to leases may reduce our opportunity to exploit a given prospect for oil and natural gas production and thus have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 

It is our practice in acquiring interests in oil
and natural gas leases not to undergo the expense of retaining lawyers to fully examine the title to the interest to be placed under lease
or already placed under lease. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers or landmen who actually do the field
work in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to place under lease a specific interest. We believe
that this practice is widely followed in the oil and natural gas industry. 

16 

Prior to drilling a well for oil and natural gas,
it is the normal practice in the oil and natural gas industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to hire a lawyer
to examine the title to the unit within which the proposed oil and natural gas well is to be drilled. Frequently, as a result of such
examination, curative work must be done to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title. The work entails expense and might
include obtaining an affidavit of heirship or causing an estate to be administered. The examination made by the title lawyers may reveal
that the oil and natural gas lease or leases are worthless, having been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral
interest desired. In such instances, the amount paid for such oil and natural gas lease or leases may be lost. 

Our significant inventory of undeveloped acreage
and large percentage of undeveloped reserves may create additional economic risk. 

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability
to develop our significant inventory of future drilling locations, undeveloped acreage and undeveloped reserves. To date, the Company
has not established any proven oil and gas reserves. To the extent our drilling results are not as successful as we anticipate, natural
gas and oil prices decline, or sufficient funds are not available to drill these locations, we may not capture the expected or projected
value of these properties. In addition, delays in the development of any reserves we do prove and establish, or increases in costs to
drill and develop such reserves will reduce the value of any estimated undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such
reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. 

We may be subject to risks in connection with
acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult. 

We periodically evaluate potential acquisitions
of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy.
The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including: 

recoverable reserves; 

future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials; 

development and operating costs 

potential environmental and other liabilities; and 

our ability to obtain external financing to fund the purchase
price. 

The accuracy of these assessments is inherently
uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent
with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar
with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on
every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified,
the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not
entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis, and, as
is the case with certain liabilities associated with the properties acquired in our recent acquisitions, we are entitled to only limited
indemnification for environmental liabilities. 

17 

Significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve
other risks, including: 

diversion of our management s attention to evaluating, negotiating
and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions; 

challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information
management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business; 

challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with
acquired operations; and 

failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated
proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize
these benefits within the expected time frame. 

The process of integrating operations, including
those acquired in our recent acquisitions, could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members
of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time
they will have to manage our business. If our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant
business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. 

We may have difficulty managing our growth
and the related demands on our resources. 

We are experiencing significant growth through
the expansion of our drilling program, through recent acquisitions and our further businesses. 

Our growth will place a significant strain on
our financial, technical, operational and administrative resources. We may experience difficulties in finding and retaining additional
qualified personnel. In an effort to meet the demands of our planned activities, we may be required to supplement our staff with contract
and consulting personnel until we are able to hire new employees. In addition, our management may not be able to successfully or efficiently
manage our growth. As a result, we may be unable to fully execute our growth plans, including acquiring or integrating new businesses,
all of which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations. 

We are subject to financing and interest rate
exposure risks. 

Our future success depends on our ability to access
capital markets and obtain financing on reasonable terms. Our ability to access financial markets and obtain financing on commercially
reasonable terms in the future is dependent on a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including changes in: 

our credit rating; 

interest rates; 

the structured and commercial financial markets; 

market perceptions of us and the oil and natural gas exploration
and production industry; and 

tax burdens due to new tax laws. 

Any amounts due under our credit facility will
bear interest at a variable rate. Any increases in our interest rates, or our inability to access the debt or equity markets on reasonable
terms, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 

18 

Oil and gas prices and markets are subject
to volatility. 

Oil and natural gas prices are volatile. A substantial
or extended decline in oil prices, an expansion in the differential between market prices and the price we receive and, to a lesser extent,
a decrease in natural gas prices, could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and
ability to grow. 

Historically, the markets for natural gas and
oil have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile. As with most other companies involved in resource exploration and
development, we may be adversely affected by future increases in the costs of conducting exploration, development and resource extraction
that may not be fully offset by increases in the price received on sales of oil or natural gas. Our focus on exploration activities therefore
exposes us to greater risks than are generally encountered in later-stage oil and natural gas property development companies. 

The economic success of any drilling project will
depend on numerous factors, including: 

our ability to drill, complete and operate wells; 

our ability to estimate the volumes of recoverable reserves relating
to individual projects; 

rates of future production; 

future commodity prices received; and 

investment and operating costs and possible environmental liabilities. 

Wide fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices
may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and other factors that
are beyond our control. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be
volatile in the future. The prices a producer may expect and its level of production depend on numerous factors beyond its control, such
as: 

worldwide and domestic supplies of natural gas and oil; 

weather conditions; 

the level of consumer demand; 

the price and availability of alternative fuels; 

technological advances affecting energy consumption; 

the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other
transportation facilities; 

the price and level of foreign imports; 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 

the nature and extent of regulation relating to carbon dioxide
and other greenhouse gas emissions; 

the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; 

political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions;
and 

overall domestic and global economic conditions. 

19 

Volatile oil and natural gas prices make it difficult
to estimate the value of producing properties in an acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and natural gas producing
properties, as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value. Price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project
the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects. Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease revenues
on a per unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that can be economically produced. Lower prices will also negatively
affect the value of proved reserves. 

Our revenues, operating results, profitability
and future rate of growth depend primarily upon the prices we receive for oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas that we sell. Prices
also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. A
reduction in oil and gas prices may result in a decrease in the borrowing base or maximum credit available to us under our credit facility.
In addition, we may need to record asset carrying value write-downs if prices fall. Any substantial or extended decline in the prices
of or demand for oil would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could adversely affect
our financial position, financial results, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow. 

Conducting operations in the oil and natural
gas industry subjects us to complex laws and regulations that can have a material adverse effect on the cost, manner and feasibility of doing
business. 

Companies that explore for and develop, produce
and sell oil and natural gas in the United States are subject to extensive federal, state, local and tribal laws and regulations, including
complex tax and environmental laws and the corresponding regulations, and are required to obtain various permits and approvals from federal,
state, local and tribal agencies and authorities. Our ability to obtain, sustain and renew these permits on acceptable terms and without
unfavorable restrictions or conditions is subject to a change in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable governmental
agencies or authorities, among other factors. Our inability to obtain, or our loss of or denial of extensions of, any of these permits
could limit our ability to conduct our operations as planned. In addition, we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with
governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include: 

water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations; 

drilling permits and bonds; 

method of drilling and casing wells; 

well stimulation processes; 

plugging and abandoning wells and reclamation and restoration
of properties; 

reports concerning operations; 

air quality, noise levels and related permits; 

location and spacing of wells; 

rights-of-way and easements; 

unitization and pooling of properties; 

gathering, storage, transportation and marketing of oil and natural
gas; 

habitat and endangered species protection; 

reclamation and remediation, and environmental protection; 

safety precautions; 

taxation; and 

waste transport and disposal permits and requirements. 

Failure to comply with these laws may result in
the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to liabilities and administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Compliance
costs can be significant. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase the costs of doing business. Any such
liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

20 

Developments in the global financial system
may have impacts on our liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predict. 

Global financial markets may have a material adverse
impact on our business and our financial condition, and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets are inadequate to
finance our activities at a reasonable cost of capital. There continues to be concerns over the worldwide economic outlook, geopolitical
issues, the availability and costs of credit and the sovereign debt crisis have contributed to increased volatility in the global financial
markets and commodity prices and diminished expectations for the global economy. We are unable to predict the duration or severity of
the current economic situation or its impact on our business. As a result, our ability to access the capital markets or borrow money may
be restricted or made more expensive at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an adverse impact on our
flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and on our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures in
the future. The economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to
us, and on the liquidity of our operating partners, resulting in delays in operations or their failure to make required payments. Also,
market conditions could have an impact on our natural gas and oil derivatives transactions if our counterparties are unable to perform
their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Additionally, developments in the global financial system could lead to further reductions
in the demand for natural gas and oil, or further reductions in the prices of natural gas and oil, or both, which could have a negative
impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. While the ultimate outcome and impact of the current financial
situation cannot be predicted, it may have a material adverse effect on our future liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our operations are subject to environmental,
health and safety, and historic preservation laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. 

Our oil and natural gas exploration and production
operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, local and tribal laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects
of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and historic preservation.
These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the Clean Air Act,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Safe Drinking
Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act, Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, and their state counterparts
and similar statutes, which provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. 

These laws and regulations may impose numerous
obligations on us and our operations including by requiring us to obtain permits before conducting drilling or underground injection activities;
restricting the types, quantities and concentration of materials that we can release into the environment; limiting or prohibiting drilling
activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, on lands containing protected species, or on
lands containing historic, cultural, archeological or paleontological sites; subjecting us to specific health and safety requirements
addressing worker protection; imposing substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations; and requiring us to
organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use in our operations to employees, state and local government authorities
and local citizens. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, and analogous state
agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, and their interpretation
and enforcement of these laws, regulations and permits have tended to become more stringent over time. Failure to comply with these laws,
regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory,
remedial or monitoring obligations; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. 

There is inherent risk of incurring significant
environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations because of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes;
air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations; our ownership, lease or operation of real property, including acquired
properties; and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. 

21 

Under certain environmental laws and regulations,
we could be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of contamination at properties we currently
own, lease or operate or have owned, leased or operated in the past. These laws often impose liability even if the owner, lessee or operator
was not responsible for the contamination, or the contamination resulted from actions taken in compliance with all applicable laws in
effect at the time. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum
hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may bring claims against us for property damage or personal injury, including
as a result of exposure to hazardous materials, or to enforce compliance with, or seek damages under, applicable environmental laws and
regulations. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Changes in environmental laws and regulations
occur frequently, and such changes could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to recover
some or any of these costs from insurance. 

Changes in tax laws may impair our results
of operations. 

The administration s proposed budget includes
numerous proposed tax changes. Among the changes contained in the budget proposal is the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income
tax preferences currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to 

(i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas
properties, 

(ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling
and development costs, 

(iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities, 

(iv) the repeal of the exception to the passive loss exception limitation
to the limitation for 
working interests in oil and gas properties, and 

(v) an extension increase of the amortization period for certain geological
and geophysical 
expenditures, and 

(vi) the establishment of certain new fees. 

The Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, which was
introduced in the U.S. Senate in May 2011, and reintroduced in 2017 includes many of the same proposals but is limited to taxpayers with
annual gross revenues in excess of 100 million (2011 draft) or in excess of 1 billion (2017 draft). It is not possible at this time
to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address these proposals would impact our business, but any such future
laws and regulations could adversely affect the amount of our taxable income or loss. 

Possible regulation related to global warming
and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for oil and gas. 

Studies over recent years have indicated that
emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth s atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have
begun adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of greenhouse
gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum
products, are considered greenhouse gases. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state
regional initiatives, have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development
of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or have begun considering adopting greenhouse gas regulatory
programs. At the federal level, Congress has considered legislation that could establish a cap and trade system for restricting greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States. The ultimate outcome of this federal legislative initiative remains uncertain. 

22 

In addition to pending climate legislation, the
EPA has issued greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting regulations. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an Endangerment
Finding under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare
of current and future generations. The finding served as a first step to issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. Moreover, the EPA has begun regulating greenhouse gas emission from certain facilities
pursuant to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the Clean Air Act. In the courts, several decisions
have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by government entities and private parties against companies that have
significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and
seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property.
Any existing or future laws or regulations that restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating
and compliance costs. In addition, such laws and regulations may adversely affect demand for the fossil fuels we produce, including by
increasing the cost of combusting fossil fuels and by creating incentives for the use of alternative fuels and energy. 

The oil and natural gas industry is subject to significant competition,
which may adversely affect our ability to compete. 

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive
and changing federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, wildlife protection, historic
preservation and health and safety. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards,
and we expect that this trend will continue. 

Among other things, these laws and regulations: 

require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations before
construction, drilling and certain other activities; 

require environmental reviews and assessments of proposed actions
prior to the issuance of permits or the granting of governmental approvals; 

limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities
on specified lands within wilderness and other protected areas; and 

impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our
operations. 

The various environmental permits required for
our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power
to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. We believe that we are in substantial compliance
with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing
environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or interpretations thereof could have
a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. The following is a summary of the more significant
existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may
have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites
and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon
for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural
resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly
caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 

23 

The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize
the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for non-compliance, as well as requirements for corrective act ions. Although CERCLA
currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, state laws affecting our operations may impose
clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes
as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes
subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up
of sites and disposal of substances found on drilling and production sites long after operations on such sites have been completed. 

Other statutes relating to the storage and handling
of pollutants include the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which requires certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise
handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The OPA, contains
numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. State laws
mandate oil cleanup programs with respect to contaminated soil. A failure to comply with OPA s requirements or inadequate cooperation
during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions. 

The Endangered Species Act, or ESA, seeks to ensure
that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, or destroy or modify the critical habitat of
such species. Under the ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair
or jeopardize the species or its habitat. The ESA has been used to prevent or delay drilling activities and provides for criminal penalties
for willful violations of its provisions. 

Other statutes that provide protection to animal
and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, without limitation, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery
Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Although we believe that
our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as
threatened or endangered or re-determination of the extent of critical habit could subject us to significant expenses to
modify our operations or could force us to discontinue some operations altogether. 

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA,
requires a thorough review of the environmental impacts of major federal actions and a determination of whether proposed
actions on federal and certain Indian lands would result in significant impact on the environment. For purposes of NEPA,
 major federal action can be something as basic as issuance of a required permit. For oil and gas operations on federal and
certain Indian lands or requiring federal permits, NEPA review can increase the time for obtaining approval and impose additional regulatory
burdens on the natural gas and oil industry, thereby increasing our costs of doing business and our profitability. 

The Clean Water Act, or CWA, and comparable state
statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into
waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a
permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water run-off from oil
and natural gas facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility
to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. 

24 

The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder
also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately
issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges
for oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental
damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. 

The Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, and the
Underground Injection Control (UIC) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells.
EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state.
The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of
groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs,
among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other
parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 

Our operations employ hydraulic fracturing techniques
to stimulate natural gas production from unconventional geological formations, which entails the injection of pressurized fracturing fluids
into a well bore. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the SDWA to exclude hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground
injection under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations
and others in the public. Legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal this exemption and require federal permitting and regulatory control
of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the
fracturing process, has been introduced in the current session of Congress. 

The U.S. Department of the Interior has announced
that it will consider regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing
fluid constituents. In addition, some states and localities have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations or ordinances
that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, or that would impose higher taxes, fees or royalties on natural gas
production. If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements
could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing
and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. It is also possible that our drilling and injection operations could adversely
affect the environment, which could result in a requirement to perform investigations or clean-ups or in the incurrence of other unexpected
material costs or liabilities. 

The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts the emission
of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can
begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. In addition, more stringent regulations
governing emissions of air pollutants, including greenhouse gases such as methane (a component of natural gas) and carbon dioxide are
being developed by the federal government, and may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities or the cost of transportation
or processing of produced oil and natural gas which may affect our operating costs. Legislation targeting air emissions from hydraulic
fracturing activities has been introduced in the current session of Congress and if passed may increase our costs of compliance and doing
business. In addition, the EPA has promulgated more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from sources in
the oil and gas industry, and these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. 

25 

Significant studies and research have been devoted
to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally.
Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific
research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. 

Many state governments have enacted legislation
directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future state and federal legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions
or requirements in connection with our operations and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could increase operating costs and
demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted
at controlling climate change. 

We are subject to a number of federal and state
laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (OSHA), and comparable state laws, whose purpose
is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations
under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained
concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local
government authorities and citizens. 

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations
relating to preservation and protection of historical and cultural resources. Such laws include the National Historic Preservation Act,
the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and the Paleontological Resources
Preservation Act, and their state counterparts and similar statutes, which require certain assessments and mitigation activities if historical
or cultural resources are impacted by our activities and provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions
for violation of their requirements. 

We do not believe that our environmental, health
and safety risks are materially different from those of comparable companies in the United States in the oil and natural gas industry.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will not result in a curtailment
of production or material increase in the cost of production, development or exploration or otherwise adversely affect our capital expenditures,
financial condition and results of operations. 

We have acquired, and may in the future acquire,
interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others and may be liable for environmental damage, including historical
contamination, caused by such former operators. Additional liabilities could also arise from continuing violations or contamination not
discovered during our assessment of the acquired properties. We have not incurred, and do not currently anticipate incurring, any material
capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or a public market for our common stock may not materialize if it becomes
quoted. 

If our securities are not eligible for initial
or continued quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or if a public trading market does not develop, purchasers of the common
stock in this Offering may have difficulty selling or be unable to sell their securities should they desire to do so, rendering their
shares effectively worthless and resulting in a complete loss of their investment. 

If we
do not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A to become a mandatory reporting company under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, we will continue as a reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement requirements, and our officers, directors
and 10 stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity, all of which
could reduce the value of your investment and the amount of publicly available information about us. 

As a result of the Company s Offering as
required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange. We
intend voluntarily to file a registration statement on Form 8-A which will subject us to all of the reporting requirements of the 1934
Act. This will require us to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC. In
addition, our officers, directors and 10 stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock
trading activity. We are not required under Section 12(g) or otherwise to become a mandatory 1934 Act filer unless we have more than 500
shareholders and total assets of more than 10 million on February 10, 2022. If we do not file a registration statement on Form 8-A, we
will continue as a reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement requirements of the 1934 Act, and our officers, directors
and 10 stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity. 

Because we will be subject to penny
stock rules if our shares are quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, the level of trading activity in our stock may be
reduced. Further, the status of our stock as a penny stock is not tied to being quoted on the OTCBB. 

Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions
in penny stocks are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally
are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges). Our
stock is a penny stock and its status as a penny stock is not tied to being quoted on the OTCBB. The penny stock rules require a
broker-dealer to deliver to its customers a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the
nature and level of risks in the penny stock market prior to carrying out a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the
rules,. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of
the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose
this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established
customers and accredited investors must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment
for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the
effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules. If
a trading market does develop for our common stock, these regulations will likely be applicable, and investors in our common stock may
find it difficult to sell their shares. 

27 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our stock, which could depress our share price. 

FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment
to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to
recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain
information about the customer s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least
some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which
may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares, depressing our share price. 

State securities laws may limit secondary trading,
which may restrict the states in which you can sell the shares offered by this prospectus. 

If you purchase shares of our common stock sold
pursuant to this Offering, you may not be able to resell the shares in a certain state unless and until the shares of our common stock
are qualified for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such
as listing in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that
we will be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading, or identifying an available exemption for secondary
trading in our common stock in every state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading
of, our common stock in any particular state, the shares of common stock could not be offered or sold to, or purchased by, a resident
of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock, the market for
the common stock will be limited which could drive down the market price of our common stock and reduce the liquidity of the shares of
our common stock and a stockholder s ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market prices, which could
increase a stockholder s risk of losing some or all of his investment. 

Our Company has a concentration of stock ownership
and control, which may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change of control. 

Our common stock ownership is highly concentrated.
Through ownership of shares of our common stock, one shareholder, Nowea Energy Inc. beneficially owns approximately 99 of our total outstanding
shares of common stock. As a result of the concentrated ownership of the stock, Nowea Energy Inc., which owns 45,500,100 shares of our
common stock, acting alone, will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing
or deterring a change in control of our Company. It could also deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their
shares as part of a sale of our company and it may affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, such concentration of our common
stock in Ms. Cheung could create potential or actual conflicts of interests detrimental to our stockholders and have a negative impact
on our ability to maintain effective internal controls. 

28 

If quoted, the price of our common stock may
be volatile, which may substantially increase the risk that you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price that you may
pay for the shares. 

Even if our shares are quoted for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board following this Offering and a public market develops for our common stock, the market price of our common
stock may be volatile. It may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors: 

variations in quarterly operating results; 

our announcements of significant contracts and achievement of
milestones; 

our relationships with other companies or capital commitments; 

additions or departures of key personnel; 

sales of common stock or termination of stock transfer restrictions; 

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, if any;
and 

fluctuations in stock market price and volume. 

Your inability to sell your shares during a decline
in the price of our stock may increase losses that you may suffer as a result of your investment. 

The stock market has experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations and if we face a class action suit due to the volatility of the price of our common stock, regardless of the outcome,
such litigation may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and business operations. 

The market price of the securities offered herein,
if any, may decline below the initial public offering price. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In
the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against various companies following periods of volatility in the
market price of their securities. If instituted against us, regardless of the outcome, such litigation would result in substantial costs
and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which would increase our operating expenses and affect our financial condition
and business operations. 

Because we do not intend to pay any dividends
on our common stock; holders of our common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment. 

We have not declared or paid any dividends on
our common stock since our inception, and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders
of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on their investment in our common stock. 

Any future additional issuances of our common
stock may result in immediate dilution to existing shareholders. 

We are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000
shares of common stock, of which 45,992,100 shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this filing. Our Board of Directors has
the authority, without the consent of any of our stockholders, to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock, and to determine
the rights, preferences and privileges attached to such shares. Any future additional issuances of our common stock will result in immediate
dilution to our existing shareholders interests, which may have a dilutive impact on our existing shareholders, and could negatively
affect the value of your shares. 

29 

We have not voluntarily implemented various
corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions,
conflicts of interest and similar matters. 

Recent federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate
management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements; others have been adopted
by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their
securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges and
NASDAQ, are those that address the board of Directors independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. While
our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, we have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures,
and since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that
if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that
internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct.
For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors,
decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees, may be made
by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind
our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions. 

The
outbreak of COVID-19, or a similar pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere, could have
a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the use and sufficiency of our existing
cash. 

The outbreak
of COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future
developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19,
including the delta variant, and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Many countries around the world have
imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. 

The spread
of an infectious disease, including COVID-19, may also result in the inability of our suppliers to deliver supplies to us on a timely
basis. We currently utilize third parties to, among other things, supply parts for and maintain our oil and gas equipment, and, in the
future, intend to utilize third parties to drill additional wells. If either we or any third-party parties in the supply chain for materials
used in our operations are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted,
limiting our ability to pump oil and drill new wells. 

It is
unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our oil and gas operations
resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our current and future operations. Any delays to our current and planned timelines
could also impact the use and sufficiency of our existing cash reserves, and we may be required to raise additional capital earlier than
we had previously planned. We may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed, which may result in further delays or suspension
of our development plans. If we are able to raise additional capital, challenging and uncertain economic conditions can make capital raising
costly and dilutive. 

30 

The spread of COVID-19, which
has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments,
may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may
be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial
markets. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the global effort to control COVID-19
infections could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. 

The COVID-19
pandemic and mitigation measures also have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could
have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including impairing our ability to raise capital when needed. The extent
to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business and operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot
be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. 

Such
events may result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our oil and gas
operations or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue
to monitor the situation closely.

Market Information 

There is no established public market for our
common stock. 

After the effective date of the registration statement
of which this prospectus is a part, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc., or FINRA, to have our common stock quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We will have to satisfy certain criteria in order
for our application to be accepted. We do not currently have a market maker who is willing to participate in this application process,
and even if we identify a market maker, there can be no assurance as to whether we will meet the requisite criteria or that our application
will be accepted. Our common stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or, even if quoted, a public market may
not materialize. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our shares will develop, or, if developed, that it will be
sustained. 

Stockholders 

As of April 10, 2023, there were 48 stockholders
of record of our common stock. The actual number of holders of our common stock is greater than this number of record holders, and includes
stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers or held by other nominees. This number of
holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. 

Dividend Policy 

We have never paid or declared any cash dividends
on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

492,000 shares to forty-six (46) separate foreign shareholders and one (1) domestic shareholder pursuant to a private placement of our
common stock exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, for total proceeds of approximately 24,600. We
issued a total of 45,500,100 shares to our founding shareholder for total proceeds of approximately 515,000.

activities on the wells. 

During the period from March 18, 2020 (inception)
through December 31, 2021, the Company capitalized 20,000 of acquisition and development costs related to these leases, related to the
asset retirement bond purchased in the State of Kentucky. 

There is little oil production from the 17 wells
located at our leases. The wells currently show a production of approximately 30 to 60BBLS of oil per month per well. 

As of March 31, 2023, we currently hold ownership
in the following seventeen (17) wells:

We are a development stage company that has generated
no net revenues and has had limited operations to date. At December 31, 2022, the Company has had limited revenues, has a working
capital deficit of 279,747 and has an accumulated deficit of 530,887. As of December 31, 2022, we had 11,621 in current assets
and current liabilities of 291,368. Through December 31, 2022, we have issued an aggregate of 45,992,100 shares of our common stock since
our inception We issued 100 shares of our common stock to the founding shareholder for services in connection with the formation and organization
of the Company and sold the same founding shareholder 44,000,000 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of 440,000. We issued
a total of 492,000 shares of our common stock to forty-six (46) separate foreign shareholders and one (1) domestic shareholder through
March 31, 2022, pursuant to a private placement of our common stock exempt from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act
of 1933, for total proceeds of approximately 24,600. Except for acquisition of the seventeen (17) wells described above, since our inception
we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. 

Results of Operations 

Year Ended December
31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Revenues 

The Company recognized
revenue of 29,471 during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 8,518 during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher oil
prices in the current period and increased volumes. 

Oil Gas Production
Expenses 

Total oil and gas production
expenses were 17,378 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 23,571 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in
the current period was due to the prior period including higher legal and acquisition costs associated with securing the Company s
property interests, and lower maintenance costs on the wells. 

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses 

Total selling, general
and administrative expenses were 187,862 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 243,354 for the year ended December 31,
2021. The decrease is primarily due to the prior period containing higher CEO compensation and higher professional costs as the Company
moved towards the filing of its registration statement. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

Through
Dec ember 31, 2022, the Company s principal sources funds are investments from a single
shareholder. The Company would need to raise additional capital in order to meet its business plan. Management intends to secure additional
funds using borrowing or the further sale of securities to accredited investors in the future. There is no assurance that we may secure
funding, or whether it can do so on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and its liquidity would be severely compromised. 

Cash Flow Information 

The following summarizes
cash flow information for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 

37 

Cash Flows From Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities was 77,500 and 171,950 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and mainly included property development
and maintenance costs, officer compensation, and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. 

Cash Flows From
Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by
financing activities was 63,783 for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to proceeds from related party note payables. During the year
ended December 31, 2021, the Company received 99,600 from common stock sales to the Company s principal shareholder and 50,000
from a related party note payable.. 

Going Concern Qualification 

We have a history of
losses, an accumulated deficit of 530,887 as of December 31, 2022, historical negative working capital and have not generated cash from
operations to support a meaningful and ongoing business plan. Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm has included a Going
Concern Qualification in their report for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We intend on financing our future activities and working capital needs from
the sale of private and/or public equity securities with additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes,
until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. There is no guarantee that additional
capital or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to us.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Going
Concern Qualification might make it more difficult to raise capital. 

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of our
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience
and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance. Estimates and assumptions
about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as additional information
is obtained, as more experience is acquired, as our operating environment changes and as new events occur. 

(a) Oil and Gas Properties 

The Company utilizes
the full-cost method of accounting for petroleum and natural gas properties. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all costs associated
with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves, including leasehold acquisition costs, geological and geophysical
expenditures, lease rentals on undeveloped properties and costs of drilling of productive and non-productive wells into the full cost
pool. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no properties with proven reserves. When the Company obtains proven oil and gas reserves,
capitalized costs, including estimated future costs to develop the reserves proved and estimated abandonment costs, net of salvage, will
be depleted on the units-of-production method using estimates of proved reserves. The costs of unproved properties are not amortized until
it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties. the Company assesses the property at least quarterly
to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. In assessing impairment the Company performs a ceiling test calculation and considers factors
such as historical experience and other data such as primary lease terms of the property, average holding periods of unproved property,
and geographic and geologic data. 

As of December 31, 2022,
the Company s oil and gas leases are unproved and, as such, no depletion expense has been recorded for the periods then ended. 

38 

(b) Revenue recognition 

The Company recognizes
revenue in accordance with the principles of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606. The Company s revenue is typically generated from contracts to sell natural gas produced from interests
in oil and gas properties owned by the Company. The Company typically elects to treat contracts to sell oil and gas production as normal
sales, which are then accounted for as contracts with customers. The Company has determined that these contracts represent a single performance
obligation which is satisfied when control of the commodity transfers to the customer, typically through the delivery of the specified
commodity to a designated delivery point. 

Revenue is measured based
on consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company
recognizes revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring control of
those goods to the customer at the time of sale. The contract consideration in the Company s variable price contracts are typically
allocated to specific performance obligations in the contract according to the price stated in the contract. Amounts allocated in the
Company s fixed price contracts are based on the standalone selling price of those products in the context of long-term, fixed price
contracts, which generally approximates the contract price. Payment is generally received one or two months after the sale has occurred. 

Capital Resources 

We had no material commitments
for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of EnergieInvesting.com,
Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statement of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit),
and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s significant operating
losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Impact of COVID-19 

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 ), which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the related responses
by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat its outbreak and spread, has severely impacted the U.S. and world
economies. Economic recessions, including those brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak may have a negative effect on the demand for the Company s
products and the Company s operating results. The range of possible impacts on the Company s business from the coronavirus
pandemic could include: (i) changing demand for the Company s products; and (ii) potential disruption to the Company s supply
chain and distribution network. 

Revenue is measured based on consideration specified
in the contract with the customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue in the
amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring control of those goods to the customer
at the time of sale. The contract consideration in the Company s variable price contracts are typically allocated to specific performance
obligations in the contract according to the price stated in the contract. Amounts allocated in the Company s fixed price contracts
are based on the standalone selling price of those products in the context of long-term, fixed price contracts, which generally approximates

overselling working interests to various parties. In July 2021, the Company entered into a settlement with certain of these owners to
assign their interests to the Company in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. In January 2022, the Company received a summary judgement
in its favor for the remaining working interests.

Change in valuation allowance 

Provision for income taxes 

Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to
compute tax asset benefits for non-capital losses carried forward. Potential benefit of non-capital losses have not been recognized in
these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the losses carried forward
in future years. 

Significant components of the Company s
deferred tax assets and liabilities, after applying enacted corporate income tax rates, are as follows: 

Valuation allowance 

Net deferred income tax asset 

The Company s tax years from to 2020 onward
are currently remain open and subject to examination by federal tax authorities. Management currently believes that since the Company
has a history of losses it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the loss carry forwards and other temporary differences
will not be realized in the foreseeable future. The valuation allowance reflects the Company s estimate that the tax assets, more
likely than not, will not be realized and consequently have not been recorded in these financial statements. The Company's cumulative
net operating loss carry forward of approximately that will be carried forward to offset future taxable income.

 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures
refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures, as of December 31, 2022. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in applicable rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Material Weakness in Internal Controls Over
Financial Reporting 

We identified a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting that exists as of December 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material
weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in place an effective internal control environment
with formal processes and procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting transactions
that would identify errors in a timely manner. 

Notwithstanding the material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

40 

Management s Plan to Remediate the Material
Weakness 

With the oversight of senior
management, management is working towards remediation of these weaknesses in 2023 including addition of accounting personnel and to evaluate
and implement procedures that will strengthen our internal controls. While we believe these measures will remediate the material weakness
identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, there is no assurance that we will demonstrate sufficient improvement
that the material weakness will be remediated. We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue
to diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

This
Annual Report does not include a report of management s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public
companies. 

Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
