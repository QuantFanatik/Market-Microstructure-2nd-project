Summary of Risk Factors 

An investment in the Units of each Series is subject
to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. The following summary should not be considered
an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing the Trust, and it should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors 
section and the other information contained in this Form 10-K. 

Structural Risks 

The
Trust, the Trading Companies and the Galaxy Plus entities are not registered investment companies. 

Certain
restrictions on redemption and transfer of the Units apply, redemptions may be temporarily suspended, and a substantial number of redemption
requests in a short period may result in losses. 

Unitholders
have limited rights, including not being able to review any Series holdings on a daily basis, cannot prevent the Trust from taking
actions which could cause losses, and will not be aware of changes to trading programs or investments into, or divestments from, any
Galaxy Plus entities. 

The
Managing Owner may allocate nominal assets in respect of a Series in excess of its Net Asset Value, and it may adjust the leverage employed
by a Trading Advisor in its sole discretion. 

Each
Series may be charged substantial fees and expenses regardless of profitability, including indirect fees and expenses associated with
derivative instruments. 

The
failure by one or more of a Series counterparties could result in a substantial loss of such Series assets. 

There
are certain risks associated with investments in series LLCs (such as certain of the Trading Companies and the Galaxy Plus entities),
and certain conflicts of interest exist in the structure and operation of the Trust. 

The
Managing Owner is leanly staffed and relies heavily on its key personnel to manage the Trust s trading activities, and the loss
of such personnel could adversely affect the Trust. Unitholders do not have privity of contract with service providers to the Trust or
any Series, including the Trading Advisors. 

Risks Relating to Trading and the Markets 

The
Trading Advisors may trade in futures, options, and swaps, each of which carry distinct risks. 

The
trading on behalf of each Series will be margined, which means that sharp declines in prices could lead to large losses. 

Trading
on unregulated or foreign exchanges involves risks that trading on regulated or U.S. exchanges does not, such as lack of investor protection
regulation, possible government intervention, relatively new markets and exchange-rate exposure. 

The
Trading Advisors positions may be concentrated from time to time, which may render each Series susceptible to larger losses than
if the positions were more diversified. 

Turnover
in each Series portfolio may be high which could result in higher brokerage commissions and transaction fees and expenses. 

There
are certain risks associated with the Trust s investment in U.S. government debt securities, including market risk, interest rate
risk and credit risk. 

Investments
in reference programs through a swap or other derivative instrument may not always replicate exactly the performance of the relevant
CTA trading program(s). 

ii 

Risks Relating to the Trading Advisors 

There
are disadvantages to making trading decisions based on technical analysis and fundamental analysis. 

Increased
competition from other systematic traders could reduce the Trading Advisors profitability. 

The
incentive fees could be an incentive to the Trading Advisors to make riskier investments. 

The
risk management approaches of one or all of the Trading Advisors may not be fully effective, and a Series may incur losses. 

Increases
in assets under management of any of the Trading Advisors could lead to diminished returns. 

Each
Series relies on its Trading Advisor(s) for success, and if a Trading Advisor s trading is unsuccessful, the Series may incur losses. 

The
Managing Owner s allocation of the Trust s assets among Trading Advisors may result in less than optimal performance by the
Trust. 

Each
Trading Advisor advises other clients and may achieve more favorable results for its other accounts. 

The
Managing Owner places significant reliance on the Trading Advisors and their key personnel; the loss of such personnel could adversely
affect a Series. 

The
success of each Series depends on the ability of the personnel of its Trading Advisor(s) to accurately implement their trading systems,
and any failure to do so could subject a Series to losses. 

Stop-loss
orders may not prevent large losses. 

Risks Relating to the Galaxy Plus Platform 

The
success of each Series depends on the performance of the Galaxy Plus entities in which each Series invests. 

The
Galaxy Plus Platform is recently established and has a limited operating history and the Galaxy Plus entities have limited or no operating
history or track record. 

A
Series may incur losses related to other investors large redemptions from, or investments into, a Galaxy Plus entity. 

The
Galaxy Plus Platform operates independently from each Series, the Trust and the Managing Owner, and the Managing Owner will have no control
over, or involvement in, the operation and administration of the commodity pools. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform and New Hyde Park Alts, LLC New Hyde Park may limit the ability of a Series to invest in, or divest from, a Galaxy Plus entity. New Hyde Park is the Galaxy Plus Platform sponsor and operator. 

Cessation
of, or changes to, the operation of the Galaxy Plus Platform could adversely impact the performance of a Series. 

Investment
in Galaxy Plus entities presents operational, administrative risk to each Series. 

The
use of multiple Trading Advisors may result in offsetting or opposing trading positions and may also require one Trading Advisor to fund
the margin requirements of another Trading Advisor. 

The Trading Advisors trading programs bear some similarities
and, therefore, may lessen the benefits to the Series which have multiple Trading Advisors. 

Operating Risks 

The
Managing Owner may allocate notional assets in respect of a Series that are in excess of the net asset value of such Series. 

Differing
levels of fees received may create an incentive for the Managing Owner to favor certain Series over others. 

The
Managing Owner may terminate, replace and/or add Trading Advisors in its sole discretion which may disrupt trading, adversely affecting
the net asset value of a Series. 

iii 

Taxation and Benefits Risks 

You
may have tax liability attributable to your investment in a series even if you have received no distributions and redeemed no units,
and even if the series generated an economic loss, you may be subject to tax on gains that the Trust never realizes, and you will likely
recognize short-term capital gain. 

Partnership
treatment is not assured, and if the Trust or any Series is not treated as a Partnership, you could suffer adverse tax consequences. 

The
IRS could challenge allocations of recognized gains to Unitholders who redeem. 

The
IRS could take the position that deductions for certain Trust expenses are subject to various limitations. 

The
investment of Benefit Plan Investors may be limited and/or subject to mandatory redemption in certain circumstances. 

Foreign
investors may face exchange rate risk and local tax consequences. 

Regulatory Risks 

Regulation
of the commodity interest markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict, but
may significantly and adversely affect the Trust. 

The
Series, the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities are subject to speculative position limits. 

CFTC
registrations could be terminated which could adversely affect the Trust or a Series.

Part I 

Item 1. 
 BUSINESS . 

Overview 

Frontier Funds, which is referred to in this report
as the Trust , was formed on August 8, 2003, as a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool,
as described in Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC Regulation 4.10(d)(2). The Trust has authority to
issue separate series, or each, a Series, of units of beneficial interest (the Units pursuant to the requirements of the
Delaware Statutory Trust Act, as amended (the Trust Act ). The assets of each Series are valued and accounted for separately
from the assets of other Series. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the Investment Company Act ). The Trust is managed by Frontier Fund Management, LLC (the Managing Owner ). 

Purchasers of Units are limited owners of the
Trust Limited Owners with respect to beneficial interests of the Series Units purchased. The Trust Act provides
that, except as otherwise provided in the second amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement dated December 9, 2013,
as further amended, by and among the Managing Owner, Wilmington Trust Company as trustee and the unitholders, as amended from time to
time (the Trust Agreement ), unitholders in a Delaware statutory trust will have the same limitation of liability as do stockholders
of private corporations organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Trust Agreement confers substantially
the same limited liability, and contains the same limited exceptions thereto, as would a limited partnership agreement for a Delaware
limited partnership engaged in like transactions as the Trust. In addition, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner of the
Trust is liable for obligations of a Series in excess of that Series assets. Limited Owners do not have any such liability. The
Managing Owner will make contributions to Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a 1 interest in the aggregate capital, profits
and losses of the combined Series of the Trust. 

The Trust has been organized to pool investor
funds to trading in the United States U.S. and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural
and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities. The Trust may also engage in futures contracts, forwards, option
contracts and derivative instruments, including swap contracts. 

The Trust has seven (7) separate and distinct
series of Units issued and outstanding: Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier
Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global Fund, and Frontier Heritage Fund, (each a Series and collectively,
the Series ). The Trust financial statements are comprised of unitized Series which are consolidated into the Trust financial
statements. However, the consolidated Trust does not issue units. 

The Trust, with respect to each Series: 

engages
in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign currencies), options contracts
and other derivative instruments (including swap contracts), and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions; 

allocates
funds to a limited liability trading company or companies affiliated with the Managing Owner Trading Company or Trading
Companies or to an unaffiliated series limited liability company Galaxy Plus entities or Galaxy Plus entity ),
each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent trading advisor(s) (each a Trading Advisor that
will manage all or a portion of the applicable Trading Company s or Galaxy Plus entity s assets, and make the trading
decisions for the assets of each Series vested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and
Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated from the assets of the other Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. 

maintains
separate, distinct records for each Series, and accounts for the assets of each Series separately from the other Series; 

calculates
the Net Asset Value NAV of its Units for each Series separately from the other Series; 

has
an investment objective of increasing the value of each Series Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while managing
risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments; 

1 

maintains each Series of Units in three to seven sub-classes Class 1, Class 1AP, Class 1a, Class 2, Class 2a, Class 3, and Class 3a. Investors who have purchased Class 1a Units of Frontier Diversified Fund or Frontier Masters Fund or Class 1 Units of Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund are charged a service fee of up to two percent (2.0 annually of the NAV (or the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent (2.0 of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 or Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0 of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Global Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent (3.0 annually of the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent (3.0 of the average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee of up to two percent (2.0 of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an ongoing service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent (0.5 annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which 0.25 will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Frontier Diversified Fund, and Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series. Class 1AP was created as a sub-class of Class 1 and it has been presented separately because the fees applicable to it are different from those applicable to Class 1. Currently the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other services rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents; and 

all payments made to selling agents who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA and their associated persons that constitute underwriting compensation will be subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 2310(b)(4)(B)(ii) (formerly Rule 2810(b)(4)(B)(ii)) of the Conduct Rules of FINRA Rule 2310 ). An investor s Class 1 Units or Class 2 Units of any Series, or Class 1a Units or Class 2a Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund or Frontier Balanced Fund will be classified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of such Series, as applicable, when the Managing Owner determines that the fee limitation with respect to such Units has been reached or will be reached. The service fee limit applicable to each unit sold is reached upon the earlier of when (i) the aggregate initial and ongoing service fees received by the selling agent with respect to such unit equals 9 of the purchase price of such unit or (ii) the aggregate underwriting compensation (determined in accordance with FINRA Rule 2310) paid in respect of such unit totals 10 of the purchase price of such unit. No service fees are paid with respect to Class 3 or Class 3a Units. Units of any Class in a Series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on a daily basis, at the then current NAV per Unit for such Series on the day of the week after the date the Managing Owner is in receipt of a redemption request for at least one (1) business day to be received by the Managing Owner prior to 4:00 PM in New York. 

The assets of any particular Series include only
those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust on account of and for the benefit of that Series. Under
the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability expressly provided for under Section 3804(a) of the Trust Act, separate and distinct
records of the cash and equivalents, although pooled for maximizing returns, is maintained in the books and records of each Series. 

2 

As of December 31, 2022, the Trust, with respect
to the Frontier Diversified Fund and Frontier Masters Fund, separates Units into two separate Classes Class 2, and Class 3. The
Trust, with respect to the Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund separates Units into a maximum of three separate Classes Class
1, Class 2 and Class 1AP. The Trust with respect to the Frontier Global Fund separates Units into a maximum of two separate Classes Class
1 and Class 2. The Trust, with respect to the Frontier Balanced Fund separates Units into a maximum of five separate Classes Class
1, Class 1AP, Class 2, Class 2a and Class 3a. The Trust, with respect to the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund separates Units into a
maximum of four separate Classes Class 2a, Class 2, Class 3a and Class 3. For those Series that invest in Galaxy Plus entities,
approximately 75-95 of those Series assets are used to support the margin requirements of the Master Funds. The remaining assets of the
Series are split between investments in Trading Companies and a pooled cash management account that invests primarily in U.S. Treasury
securities. For those Series that do not invest in Galaxy Plus entities, their assets are split between investments in Trading Companies
and investments in the pooled cash management account. 

As of December 31, 2022, Frontier Global Fund
has invested a portion of its assets in a single Trading Company, and a single Trading Advisor manages 100 of the assets invested in
such Trading Company. Each of the remaining Series has invested a portion of its assets in several different Trading Companies or Galaxy
Plus entities and one or more Trading Advisors may manage the assets invested in such Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities. 

Trading Advisors are responsible for the trading
decisions of the respective Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities for which they trade. It is expected that between 75 and 95 of
each Series assets normally will be invested in one or more Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities to be committed as margin
for trading positions but from time to time these percentages may be substantially more or less. The remainder of each Series assets
is maintained at the Trust level for cash management. Each of the respective Series has invested monies into pooled cash management assets
which have included purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. Each Series ownership in these investments is based on its percentage
ownership in the pooled cash management assets on the reporting date. 

The Trading Advisors were selected based upon
the Managing Owner s evaluation of each Trading Advisor s past performance, trading portfolios and strategies, as well as
how each Trading Advisor s performance, portfolio and strategies complement and differ from those of the other Trading Advisors. 

The Managing Owner is a Delaware Limited Liability
Company formed in November 2016. The Managing Owner has delegated its commodity pool operator responsibilities to Wakefield Advisors LLC
pursuant to the Commodity Pool Operator Delegation Agreement between the Managing Owner and Wakefield Advisors LLC, which has been registered
with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator since January 7, 2013 and has been a member of the NFA since that date. The Managing Owner
remains jointly and severally liable with Wakefield Advisors LLC for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the
 CEA ), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations thereunder CPO Regulations ). However, Wakefield
Advisors LLC will indemnify the Managing Owner from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, penalty, fine, cost, and expense
(including attorneys , accountants , experts , and other professionals fees and expenses incurred in investigation
or defense of any and all demands, claims, actions, suits, or arbitrations) actually and reasonably incurred by the Managing Owner, based
upon, arising out of or from, or in any way in connection with, any act, activity, conduct, performance, omission, or non-performance
by the Wakefield Advisors LLC of any of its functions as a commodity pool operator CPO or which violates the CEA or CPO
Regulations in connection with its functions as CPO. 

The Managing Owner s main business office
is located at 25568 Genesee Trail Road, Golden, Colorado 80401, telephone (303) 454-5500. A description of the Managing Owner s
responsibilities to the Trust is contained in a Prospectus filed February 11, 2019, with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (File No. 333-210313), which is referred to herein as the Prospectus, under the section captioned
 The Managing Owner, and such description is incorporated herein by reference from the Prospectus.

Regulation 

Under the CEA, commodity exchanges and commodity
futures trading are subject to regulation by the CFTC. The NFA, a registered futures association under the CEA, is the only non-exchange
self-regulatory organization for commodity industry professionals. The CFTC has delegated responsibility to the NFA for the registration
of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing
brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The CEA requires commodity
pool operators, such as the Managing Owner, commodity trading advisors, and commodity brokers or futures commission
merchants, such as the Trust s commodity brokers, to be registered and to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping
requirements. The Managing Owner and the Trust s commodity brokers are members of the NFA. The CFTC may suspend a commodity pool
operator s or a commodity trading advisor s registration if it finds that its trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market
conditions, or as the result of violations of the CEA or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event that the Managing
Owner s registration as a commodity pool operator were terminated or suspended, the Managing Owner would be unable to continue to
manage the business of the Trust. Should the Managing Owner s registration be suspended, termination of the Trust may result. 

In addition to such registration requirements,
the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long and net short positions that any person, including
the Trust, may hold or control in particular commodities. Most exchanges also limit the maximum changes in futures contract prices that
may occur during a single trading day. The Trust also trades in dealer markets for forward and swap contracts, which are not regulated
by the CFTC. Federal and state banking authorities also do not regulate forward trading or forward dealers. In addition, the Trust trades
on foreign commodity exchanges, which are not subject to regulation by any U.S. government agency. 

Operations 

A description of the business of the Trust, including
trading approaches for each Series of Units, rights and obligations of the limited owners, compensation arrangements and fees and expenses
is contained in the Prospectus, under the sections captioned Risk Disclosure Statement, Summary, Risk
Factors, Frontier Funds Trust, The Offering, Trading Limitations, Policies and swaps, 
 The Trustee, The Managing Owner, Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest, Fees and
Expenses and the appendix attached to the Prospectus for each Series of Units, and such description is incorporated herein by reference
from the Prospectus. 

The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities
for each Series of Units engage in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign
currencies), options contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps) and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot
transactions. A brief description of the Trust s main types of investments is set forth below: 

A
futures contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity of a commodity
at a specified time and place. 

A
forward contract is an individually negotiated contract between principals, not traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a specified quantity
of a commodity at or before a specified date at a specified price. 

An
option on a futures contract, forward contract or a commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy
or sell a futures contract, forward contract or a commodity, as applicable, at a specified price on or before a specified date. Options
on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange, while options on forward contracts and commodities, referred to
collectively in this prospectus as over-the-counter options, generally are individually negotiated, principal-to-principal contracts
not traded on an exchange. 

A
swap contract generally involves an exchange of a stream of payments between the contracting parties. Swap contracts generally are not
uniform and not exchange-traded. 

Certain of the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities have entered into contractual arrangements with independent commodity trading advisors that will manage all or a portion of such
Trading Company s and Galaxy Plus entity s assets and make the trading decisions with respect to the assets of such Trading
Company or Galaxy Plus entity. 

4 

Selection and Replacement of Trading
Advisors 

The Managing Owner is responsible for the selection,
retention and termination of the Trading Advisors and reference programs on behalf of each Series. The actual allocation among Trading
Advisors for each Series will vary based upon the relative trading performance of the Trading Advisors and/or reference programs, and
the Managing Owner may otherwise vary such percentages from time to time in its sole discretion. The Managing Owner will adjust its allocations
and rebalance the portfolio of any Series among Trading Advisors to maintain weightings that it believes will most likely achieve capital
growth within the investment guidelines of the relevant Series. 

The Managing Owner utilizes certain quantitative
and qualitative analysis in connection with the identification, evaluation and selection of the Trading Advisors. The Managing Owner s
proprietary and commercial analytical software programs and comprehensive Trading Advisor database provide the quantitative basis for
the Trading Advisor selection, portfolio implementation process, and ongoing risk management, monitoring, and review. 

The Managing Owner s research department
is continually refining ways to assimilate vast amounts of Trading Advisor performance data and due-diligence information. The proprietary
and commercial database of alternative investment programs is always increasing. Research team members regularly interact with Trading
Advisors throughout the due diligence and monitoring process. Only those programs that have met strict quantitative and qualitative review
are considered as potential managers of client assets. Following is a summary of the quantitative and qualitative analysis: 

Quantitative Analysis 

The Managing Owner s analytical software
system applies a variety of statistical measures towards the evaluation of current and historical advisor performance data. Statistical
measures include but are not limited to: (1) risk/reward analysis, (2) time window analysis, (3) risk analysis, (4) correlation analysis,
(5) statistical overlays and (6) performance cycle analysis. 

Qualitative Analysis 

Although quantitative analysis statistically identifies
the top performing Trading Advisors, qualitative analysis plays a major role in the Trading Advisor evaluation and final selection process.
Each Trading Advisor in the Managing Owner s top docile universe initially undergoes extensive qualitative review by the Managing
Owner s research department, as well as continual monitoring. This analysis generally includes but is not limited to: (1) preliminary
information and due diligence, (2) background review, (3) due diligence questionnaires and (4) written review and periodic
updates. This information allows a thorough review of each Trading Advisor s trading philosophy, trading systems and corporate structure. 

Multi-Manager Approach 

A multi-manager approach to portfolio management
provides diversification of Trading Advisors and access to broader global markets. Portfolios comprised of multiple trading advisors can
provide diversification across trading methodologies, trading time horizons, and markets traded, resulting in more consistent performance
returns and overall lower volatility.

Any forward-looking statements
herein are based on expectations of the Managing Owner at this time. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the
Managing Owner s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special
considerations discussed in the Series prospectuses, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations
or other actions made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. The Series
and the Managing Owner undertake no duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. 

Item 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS . 

The Trust is a venture in a high-risk business.
An investment in the Units of each Series is very speculative. You should make an investment in one or more of the Series only after consulting
with independent, qualified sources of investment and tax advice and only if your financial condition will permit you to bear the risk
of a total loss of your investment. You should consider an investment in the Units only as a long-term investment. Moreover, to evaluate
the risks of this investment properly, you must familiarize yourself with the relevant terms and concepts relating to commodities trading
and the regulation of commodities trading, which are discussed in the Prospectus in the Statement of Additional Information below, in
the section captioned The Futures Markets, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

You should carefully consider all the information
we have included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and our subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. In particular, you should
carefully consider the risk factors described below and read the risks and uncertainties as set forth in the Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Section of this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks
and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Trust, its trading activities, operating results, financial condition and NAV
and therefore could negatively impact the value of your investment. The information contained herein does not constitute investment, legal
or tax advice. You should not invest in the Units unless you can afford to lose all of your investment. 

All trading and investment activities take place
at the Trading Company level or through a Series investment in one or more Galaxy Plus entities Platform, and since the Trust invests
substantially all of the assets of each Series in one or more Trading Companies and/or Galaxy Plus entities, each of the risks applicable
to the Trading Companies and/or Galaxy Plus entities flows through to the Series. 

Structural Risks 

Neither the Trust nor any of the
Trading Companies nor any of the Galaxy Plus entities is a registered investment company. 

Neither the Trust nor any of the Trading Companies
nor any of the Galaxy Plus entities is an investment company subject to the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, Unitholders do not have
the protections afforded by that statute. For example, the Investment Company Act requires investment companies to have a majority of
disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment adviser . 

Certain restrictions on redemption and transfer of the
Units apply. 

Unitholders generally may redeem Units daily on
one business day notice, but certain restrictions on redemption and transfer will apply. For example, if a Unitholder invests in class
1 or 1a Units and redeem all or a portion of such Units on or before the end of the 12 full months following the purchase of such Units,
a Unitholder will be charged a redemption fee of up to a percentage of the purchase price of any such Units being redeemed. Also, transfers
of Units are permitted only with the prior written consent of the Managing Owner and provided that conditions specified in the trust agreement
are satisfied. There is no secondary market for the Units and none is expected to develop. 

Redemptions may be temporarily suspended. 

The Managing Owner may temporarily suspend redemptions
for some or all of the Series for up to 30 days if the effect of any redemption, either alone or in conjunction with other redemptions,
would be to impair the Trust s ability to operate in pursuit of its objectives (for example, if the Managing Owner believes a redemption,
if allowed, would materially advantage one investor over another investor). The Managing Owner anticipates suspending redemptions only
under extreme circumstances, such as a natural disaster, force majeure, act of war, terrorism or other event which results in the closure
of financial markets. During any suspension of redemptions, a redeeming limited owner invested in a Series for which redemptions were
suspended would remain subject to market risk with respect to such Series. 

7 

An unanticipated number of redemption requests over a
short period of time could result in losses. 

Substantial redemptions of Units could require
a Series to liquidate investments more rapidly than otherwise desirable in order to raise the necessary cash to fund the redemptions,
which could result in losses. Illiquidity in the markets could make it difficult to liquidate positions on favorable terms, which could
result in additional losses. It may also be difficult for the Series to achieve a market position appropriately reflecting a smaller equity
base. 

Reserves for contingent liabilities
may be established upon redemption, and the Trust may withhold a portion of a Unitholder s redemption amount. 

When a Unitholder redeems its Units, the Trust
may find it necessary to set up a reserve for undetermined or contingent liabilities and withhold a certain portion of a Unitholder s
redemption amount. This could occur, for example, if (i) some of the positions of the Series in which a Unitholder is invested were illiquid,
(ii) there are any assets which cannot be properly valued on the redemption date, or (iii) there is any pending transaction or claim by
or against the Trust involving, or which may affect, a Unitholder s capital account or a Unitholder s obligations. 

Unitholders have limited rights
and cannot prevent the Trust from taking actions which could cause losses. 

Unitholders exercise no control over the Trust s
day-to-day business. Therefore, the Trust will take certain actions and enter into certain transactions or agreements without the Unitholders 
approval. For example, the Trust may retain a trading advisor for a Series in which a Unitholder is invested, and such trading advisor
may ultimately incur losses for the Series. As a limited owner, a Unitholder will have no ability to influence the hiring, retention or
firing of such trading advisor. However, certain actions, such as termination or dissolution of a Series, may only be taken upon the affirmative
vote of Unitholders holding Units representing at least a majority (over 50 of the net asset value of the Series (excluding Units owned
by the Managing Owner and its affiliates). 

Unitholders will not be able to
review any Series holdings on a daily basis and may suffer unanticipated losses. 

The trading advisors make trading decisions on
behalf of the assets of each Series. While the trading advisors receive daily trade confirmations from the clearing brokers of each transaction
entered into on behalf of each Series for which they manage the trading, each Series trading results are only reported to investors
monthly in summary fashion. Accordingly, an investment in the Units does not offer investors the same transparency that a personal trading
account offers. As a result, you may suffer unanticipated losses. 

Unitholders will not be aware of
changes to trading programs or investments into, or divestments from, any Galaxy Plus entities. 

Because of the proprietary nature of each trading
advisor s trading programs, you generally will not be advised if adjustments are made to a trading program or to allocations made
to one or more Galaxy Plus entities in order to accommodate additional assets under management or for any other reason.

The Trust could terminate before
a Unitholder achieves its investment objective, causing potential loss of its investment or upsetting its investment portfolio. 

Unforeseen circumstances, including substantial
losses or withdrawal of the Trust s Managing Owner, could cause the Trust to terminate before its stated termination date of December
31, 2053. The Trust s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of your investment and could upset the overall
maturity and timing of your investment portfolio. 

The Managing Owner may allocate
nominal assets in respect of a Series that are in excess of the Net Asset Value of such Series. 

At any given time, the nominal assets of a Series
may exceed the net asset value of such Series depending on the amount of notional equity that is being utilized, including through investments
in the Galaxy Plus entities. The Managing Owner expects that the nominal assets of each Series will generally be maintained at a level
in excess of the net asset value of such Series and such excess may be substantial to the extent the Managing Owner deems necessary to
achieve the desired level of volatility. The Managing Owner also expects each of the trading advisors to the Galaxy Plus entities to maintain
nominal assets at a level in excess of the net asset value of such Galaxy Plus entity. To the extent that nominal assets of a Series or
Galaxy Plus entity are in excess of net asset value, investors should understand that the applicable Series or Galaxy Plus entity will
experience greater volatility as measured by net asset value than it would if the nominal assets were maintained at a level equal to net
asset value. In such case, any losses to the Series or Galaxy Plus entity will be greater as measured by a percentage of net asset value,
as compared to the percentage loss incurred in respect of nominal assets. Consequently, the allocation of nominal assets in excess of
a Series or Galaxy Plus entity s net asset value will magnify exposure to the swings in market prices of futures, forwards,
options or other assets held by a Trading Company, Galaxy Plus entity or referenced by a swap or other derivative instrument and result
in increased volatility, and potentially greater losses. You may lose all or substantially all of your investment in a Series. 

The Managing Owner may adjust the
leverage employed by a Trading Advisor through a Trading Company to maintain the target rate of volatility. 

In its sole discretion, the Managing Owner may
modify the allocations between the trading advisors used by a particular Series at any time, including adding new trading advisors or
terminating current trading advisor relationships, and the Managing Owner may also increase or decrease the amount of leverage employed
by a specific trading advisor by allocating notional funds to a particular trading advisor in accordance with the Managing Owner s
proprietary management program. The Managing Owner may increase or decrease the notional equity allocated to one or more individual trading
advisors over time in order to adjust the annual volatility for a Series within the target volatility range disclosed for such Series. 

To the extent that the Managing Owner increases
the leverage employed by a particular trading advisor to maintain the target volatility of a Series, either by increasing the actual funds
which are traded by the trading advisor at a leverage of greater than 1x or by allocating notional amounts to one or more trading advisors,
the specific risks associated with the relevant trading advisors will be greater for the affected Series. As the notional equity under
management of a specific trading advisor increases, the diversification benefits attributable to a multi-advisor pool will be decreased
to an extent, since the trading advisor will manage a greater percentage of the notional exposure of the Series. Since the Managing Owner
may change the applicable leverage used by a particular trading advisor at any time, the diversification of risks between the trading
advisors is variable.

Each Series may be charged substantial
fees and expenses regardless of profitability. 

Each Series is charged brokerage charges, over-the-counter OTC dealer spreads and related transaction fees and expenses, and management fees in all cases regardless of whether any
Series activities are profitable. In addition, the Managing Owner charges each Series an incentive fee based on a percentage of
the new trading profits generated by each trading advisor for such Series or the profits generated by such Series investment in
Galaxy Plus entities. Such incentive fee is reduced by an amount equal to any performance fees paid by the Galaxy Plus entity to its trading
advisors, and to the extent any related incentive fee is paid by the Series to a trading advisor, the Managing Owner will pay all or a
portion of its incentive fee to the Series. As a result of the fact that incentive fees are calculated separately for each trading advisor
and Galaxy Plus entity to which the Series has allocated assets and each Series allocates assets to multiple trading advisors and/or Galaxy
Plus entities, it is possible that substantial incentive fees may be paid out of the net assets of a Series during periods in which such
Series has no net new trading profits or in which such Series actually loses money. In addition, each Series must earn new trading profits
and interest income sufficient to cover these fees and expenses in order for it to be profitable. 

Investors should note that the management fee
payable to the Managing Owner is based on nominal assets rather than net asset value. Therefore, the management fee will be greater as
a percentage of a Series net asset value to the extent that the nominal assets of such Series exceed its net asset value. The Managing
Owner expects that the nominal assets of each Series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such
Series and such excess may be substantial to the extent the Managing Owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility.
In addition, basing the management fee on nominal assets may result in the Managing Owner receiving a higher management fee than if it
was based on net asset value. This method of calculating the management fee payable to the Managing Owner may differ from how other commodity
pools that are similar to the Trust calculate their management fees. 

There are certain risks associated
with investments in Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. 

Certain of the trading companies and Galaxy Plus entities may be organized
as series limited liability companies. This means that, under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the assets of one series are
not available to pay the liabilities of another series or the trading company as a whole. This statute has not been tested in a court
of law in the United States. In the event series limited liability is not enforceable, a segregated series could be obligated to pay the
liabilities of another series or the trading company. In addition, each of the Trust s Series is subject to, and invests a portion
of its assets in Galaxy Plus entities that are subject to, risks related to the operation and administration of the Galaxy Plus Managed
Account Platform Galaxy Plus Platform by officers and employees of New Hyde Park. 

Each Series invests in trading companies that,
although they are organized as series limited liability companies, allocate assets to more than one commodity trading advisor without
the establishment of separate series with segregated liabilities. For these trading companies, losses incurred by one commodity trading
advisor may negatively impact the trading company as a whole, as the assets allocated to a different commodity trading advisor may be
made available to pay the liabilities of the commodity trading advisor that has incurred the loss. Since each of the Frontier Diversified
Fund, the Frontier Masters Fund and the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund currently invests in such trading companies, this could indirectly
cause the assets of one Series to be used to pay the liabilities of another Series. For trading companies that allocate assets to more
than one commodity trading advisor, a series may be allowed to allocate a portion of its assets to a particular commodity trading advisor
accessed by the trading company, rather than to the trading company as a whole. 

Conflicts of interest exist in the
structure and operation of the Trust. 

A number of actual and potential conflicts of
interest exist in the operation of the Trust s business. The Managing Owner, the trading advisors, the independent administrator,
the independent transfer agent, the clearing brokers, the Trustee and their respective principals are all engaged in other investment
activities and are not required to devote substantially all of their time to the Trust s business. 

10 

Each Series may incur higher fees
and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships. 

The clearing agreements between the clearing brokers
and the trading companies generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given the trading company the
required notice. Upon termination of a clearing agreement, the Managing Owner may be required to renegotiate that agreement or make other
arrangements for obtaining clearing. The services of the clearing brokers may not be available, or even if available, these services may
not be available on the terms as favorable as those contained in the expired or terminated clearing agreements. 

Each Series may be subject to indirect
fees and expenses associated with investments in swaps or other derivative instruments. 

A portion of each Series assets may be
used to enter into principal-to-principal OTC derivative contracts, including swaps, which are individually negotiated by the parties
and priced by the counterparty and may include fees and expenses that are accounted for in the pricing under the applicable contract.
Such indirect embedded expenses may not be identifiable or enumerated explicitly in confirms or other transaction documentation. Each
Series may pay a fee to a counterparty in respect of any swap or derivative instruments of up to 0.50 of the notional amount of such
swap or derivative instrument. Any management fee or incentive fees embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument may be greater or
less than the management fee or incentive fees that would otherwise be charged to the Series by the Managing Owner. During the periods
covered in this report, none of the Series owned a derivative instrument or swap. 

The failure or bankruptcy of one
of its futures clearing brokers, central clearing brokers, banks, counterparties or other custodians could result in a substantial loss
of one or more Series assets. 

The Trust is subject to the risk of insolvency
of an exchange, clearinghouse, central clearing broker, commodity broker, and counterparties with whom the trading companies trade. Trust
assets could be lost or impounded in such an insolvency during lengthy bankruptcy proceedings. Were a substantial portion of the Trust s
capital tied up in a bankruptcy, the Managing Owner might suspend or limit trading, perhaps causing a Series to miss significant profit
opportunities. The Trust is subject to the risk of the inability or refusal to perform on the part of the counterparties with whom contracts
are traded. In the event that the clearing brokers are unable to perform their obligations, the Trust s assets are at risk and investors
may only recover a pro rata share of their investment, or nothing at all. 

Exchange-traded futures and futures-styled option
contracts are marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in value credited or charged to the Trust s account on a daily
basis. The clearing brokers, as futures commission merchants for the Trust s exchange-traded contracts, are required, pursuant to
CFTC regulations, to segregate from their own assets, and for the sole benefit of its commodity customers, all funds held by such clients
with respect to exchange-traded futures and futures-styled options contracts, including an amount equal to the net unrealized gain on
all open futures and futures-styled options contracts. Similar requirements apply with respect to funds held in connection with cleared
swap contracts. Bankruptcy law applicable to all U.S. futures brokers requires that, in the event of the bankruptcy of such a broker,
all property held by the broker, including certain property specifically traceable to the Trust, will be returned, transferred, or distributed
to the broker s customers only to the extent of each customer s pro rata share of the assets held by such
futures broker. The Managing Owner will attempt to limit the Trust s deposits and transactions to well-capitalized institutions
in an effort to mitigate such risks, but there can be no assurance that even a well-capitalized, major institution will not become bankrupt. 

11 

In the event of a shortfall in segregated customer
funds held by the futures commission merchant, the Series assets on account with the futures commission merchant may be at risk
in the event of the futures commission merchant s bankruptcy or insolvency, and in such event, the Series may only recover a portion
of the available customer funds. If no property is available for distribution, the Series would not recover any of its assets. With respect
to a Series OTC uncleared swaps, prior to the implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, as amended (the Dodd-Frank Act ), there was no requirement to segregate funds held with respect to such contracts.
There is now a requirement to segregate funds held as variation margin posted by a party engaging in uncleared swaps with a swap dealer
or major swap participant; moreover, a party engaging in uncleared swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant can ask that the
initial margin posted by such party be held with an independent third-party custodian. Generally, the party requesting segregation will
pay the costs of such custodial arrangement. There may also be costs and delays involved in negotiating the custodial arrangement and
related contractual terms. 

With respect to transactions a Series enters into
that are not traded on an exchange, there are no daily settlements of variations in value and there is no requirement to segregate funds
held with respect to such accounts. Thus, the funds that a Series invests in such transactions may not have the same protections as funds
used as margin or to guarantee exchange-traded futures and options contracts. If the counterparty becomes insolvent and a Series has a
claim for amounts deposited or profits earned on transactions with the counterparty, the Series claim may not receive a priority.
Without a priority, the Trust is a general creditor and its claim will be paid, along with the claims of other general creditors, from
any monies still available after priority claims are paid. Even funds of the Trust that the counterparty keeps separate from its own operating
funds may not be safe from the claims of other general and priority creditors. There are no limitations on the amount of allocated assets
a portfolio manager can trade on foreign exchanges or in forward contracts. 

A Unitholder may not be able to
establish a basis for liability against a Trading Advisor, a clearing broker or a swap counterparty. 

Each trading advisor, clearing broker, and swap
counterparty acts only as a trading advisor, clearing broker or swap counterparty, respectively, to the applicable Series and/or trading
company. These parties do not act as trading advisors, clearing brokers, or swap counterparties to you. Therefore, you have no contractual
privity with the trading advisors, the clearing brokers, or any swap counterparty. Due to this lack of contractual privity, you may not
be able to establish a basis for liability against a trading advisor, clearing broker, or swap counterparty. 

The Managing Owner is leanly staffed
and relies heavily on its key personnel to manage the Trust s trading activities. The loss of such personnel could adversely affect
the Trust. 

In managing and directing the day-to-day activities
and affairs of the Trust, the Managing Owner relies heavily on its principals. The Managing Owner is leanly staffed, although there are
back-up personnel for every key function. If any of the Managing Owner s key persons were to leave or be unable to carry out his
or her present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of the Trust. 

12 

Risks Relating to Trading and the Markets 

Futures interests trading is speculative
and volatile. 

The rapid fluctuations in the market prices of
futures, forwards, and options make an investment in any of the Series volatile. Volatility is caused by, among other things: changes
in supply and demand relationships; weather; agriculture, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs; domestic and foreign
political and economic events and policies; and changes in interest rates. The Trading Advisors technical trading methods may not
take account of these factors except as they may be reflected in the technical input data analyzed by the Trading Advisors. In addition,
governments from time to time intervene, directly and by regulation, in certain markets, often with the intent to influence prices directly.
The effects of governmental intervention may be particularly significant at certain times in the financial instrument and currency markets,
and this intervention may cause these markets to move rapidly. 

Each Series performance will be volatile,
and a Series could lose all or substantially all of its assets. The multi-advisor feature of each Series, except for Frontier Global Fund,
along with its investments in Galaxy Plus entities, may reduce the return volatility relative of the performance of single-advisor investment
funds. 

Options trading can be more volatile
and expensive than futures trading. 

Options
are derivatives that give the purchaser the option to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset from or to a counterparty at a specified
price (the strike price) on or before an expiration date. Certain trading advisors may purchase or write (i.e., sell) put and call options
on an underlying reference it is otherwise permitted to invest in. By investing in options, the series are exposed to the risk that it
may be required to buy or sell the underlying reference at a disadvantageous price on or before the expiration date. If a series sells
a put option, the series may be required to buy the underlying reference at a strike price that is above market price, resulting in a
loss. If a series sells a call option, the series may be required to sell the underlying reference at a strike price that is below market
price, resulting in a loss. If a series sells a call option that is not covered (it does not own the underlying reference), the series 
losses are potentially unlimited. Options may involve economic leverage, which could result in greater volatility in price movement. Options
may be traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market. At or prior to maturity of an options contract, a series may
enter into an offsetting contract and may incur a loss to the extent there has been adverse movement in options prices. Options can increase
a series risk exposure to underlying references and their attendant risks such as credit risk, market risk, foreign currency risk
and interest rate risk, while also exposing the Fund to correlation risk, counterparty risk, hedging risk, leverage risk, liquidity risk,
pricing risk and volatility risk. 

Certain Trading Advisors may trade options on
futures. Although successful options trading requires many of the same skills as successful futures trading, the risks involved are somewhat
different. Successful options trading requires a trader to accurately assess near-term market volatility, because that volatility is immediately
reflected in the price of outstanding options. Correct assessment of market volatility can therefore be of much greater significance in
trading options than it is in many long-term futures strategies. If market volatility is incorrectly predicted, the use of options can
be extremely expensive. 

Trading Swaps Creates Distinctive
Risks. 

The series may trade in certain swaps. Unlike
futures and options on futures contracts, most swap contracts currently are not traded on or cleared by an exchange or clearinghouse.
The CFTC currently requires only a limited class of swap contracts (certain interest rate and credit default swaps) to be cleared and
executed on an exchange or other organized trading platform. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC will determine in the future
which other classes of swap contracts will be required to be cleared and executed on an exchange or other organized trading platform.
Until such time as these transactions are cleared, the series will be subject to a greater risk of counterparty default on its swaps.
Because swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal, the amount payable upon default and early termination
is usually calculated by reference to the current market value of the contract. Swap dealers and major swap participants require the series
to deposit initial margin and variation margin as collateral to support such series obligation under the swap agreement but may
not themselves provide collateral for the benefit of any series. If the counterparty to such a swap defaults, the series would be a general
unsecured creditor for any termination amounts owed by the counterparty to the series as well as for any collateral deposits in excess
of the amounts owed by the series to the counterparty, which would result in losses to the series. 

13 

There are no limitations on daily price movements
in swaps. Speculative position limits are not currently applicable to swaps, but in the future, may be applicable for swaps on certain
commodities. In addition, participants in the swap markets are not required to make continuous markets in the swaps they trade and determining
a market value for calculation of termination amounts can lead to uncertain results. 

Trading of swaps has been and will continue to
be subject to substantial change under the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory action. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, many commodity swaps
will be required to be cleared through central clearing parties and executed on exchanges or other organized trading platforms. Security-based
swaps will be subject to similar requirements. Additional regulatory requirements will apply to all swaps, whether subject to mandatory
clearing or not. These include margin, collateral and capital requirements, reporting obligations, speculative position limits for certain
swaps, and other regulatory requirements. Swaps which are not offered for clearing by a clearinghouse will continue to be traded bi-laterally.
Such bi-lateral transactions will remain subject to many of the risks discussed in the preceding paragraphs. 

Swap counterparties may hold collateral in U.S.
or non-U.S. depositories. Non-U.S. depositories are not subject to U.S. regulation. The series assets held in these depositories
are subject to the risk that events could occur which would hinder or prevent the availability of these funds for distribution to customers,
including the series. Such events may include actions by the government of the jurisdiction in which the depository is located including
expropriation, taxation, moratoria and political or diplomatic events. 

The trading on behalf
of each Series will be margined, which means that sharp declines in prices could lead to large losses. 

Because the amount of margin funds necessary to
be deposited with a futures clearing broker to enter into a futures, forward contract or option position is typically about 2 to 10 
of the total value of the contract, each Trading Advisor may take positions on behalf of a Series with face values equal to several times
such Series NAV. These low margin requirements provide a large amount of leverage. As a result of margining, even a small movement
in the price of a contract can cause major losses. Any purchase or sale of a futures or forward contract or option position may result
in losses that substantially exceed the amount invested. If severe short-term price declines occur, such declines could force the liquidation
of open positions with large losses. Margin is normally monitored through the margin-to-equity ratio employed by each Trading Advisor.
Under normal circumstances, the Trading Advisors will vary between a 10 to 30 margin-to-equity ratio. In addition, OTC transactions
present risks in addition to those associated with exchange-traded contracts, as discussed immediately below. 

The unregulated nature of uncleared
trades in the OTC markets creates counterparty risks that do not exist in futures trading on exchanges or in cleared swaps. 

Unlike futures contracts and cleared swaps, uncleared
trades, such as forward contracts, some swaps and some OTC spot contracts, are entered into between private parties off
an exchange or other trading platform and are not subject to clearing. As a result, the performance of those contracts is not guaranteed
by an exchange or its clearinghouse and the Series is at risk with respect to the ability of the counterparty to perform on the contract,
including the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Trading of foreign exchange spot contracts of foreign exchange forwards and foreign
exchange swaps (as such terms are defined in the Dodd-Frank Act), and of uncleared swaps is not regulated or is subject to limited regulation;
therefore, there are limited or no specific standards or regulatory supervision of trade pricing and other trading activities that occur
in those markets. 

14 

Foreign currency and spot contracts
historically were not regulated when traded between certain eligible contract participants and are subject to credit risk. 

Each Series may trade forward contracts in foreign
currencies and may engage in spot commodity transactions (transactions in physical commodities). These contracts, unlike futures contracts
and options on futures, historically were not regulated by the CFTC when traded between certain eligible contract participants, 
as defined in the CEA. On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law major financial services reform legislation in the form of the
Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act includes foreign currency forwards and foreign currency swaps (as such terms are defined in the Dodd-Frank
Act) in the definition of swap. The CFTC has been granted authority to regulate all swaps but grants the U.S. Treasury Department
the discretion to exempt foreign currency forwards and foreign currency swaps from all aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act other than reporting,
recordkeeping and business conduct rules for swap dealers and major swap participants. In November 2012, Treasury determined that those
transactions can be carved out of the swap category, and they are subject only to the noted categories of the Dodd-Frank Act requirements.
Therefore, the Series will not receive the full benefit of CFTC regulation for certain of their foreign currency trading activities. 

The percentage of each Series positions
that are expected to constitute foreign currency forwards and foreign currency swaps can vary substantially from month to month. 

Trading on foreign exchanges presents
greater risks to the Series than trading on U.S. exchanges. 

Each Series trades on exchanges located outside
the United States. Trading on U.S. exchanges is subject to CFTC regulation and oversight, including, for example, minimum capital requirements
for commodity brokers, segregation of customer funds, regulation of trading practices on the exchanges, prohibitions against trading ahead
of customer orders, prohibitions against filling orders off exchanges, prescribed risk disclosure statements, testing and licensing of
industry sales personnel and other industry professionals, and recordkeeping requirements, and other requirements and restrictions for
the purpose of preventing price manipulation and other disruptions to market integrity, avoiding systemic risk, preventing fraud and promoting
innovation, competition and financial integrity of transactions. Trading on foreign exchanges is not regulated by the CFTC or any other
U.S. governmental agency or instrumentality and may be subject to regulations that are different from those to which U.S. exchange trading
is subject, provide less protection to investors than trading on U.S. exchanges, and may be less vigorously enforced than regulations
in the U.S. The CFTC has no power to compel the enforcement of the rules of a foreign exchange or applicable foreign laws. Therefore,
the Series will not receive any benefit of U.S. government regulation for these trading activities. 

Trading on foreign exchanges involves some risks
that trading on U.S. exchanges does not, such as: 

Lack of Investor Protection Regulation 

The rights of the Series in the event of the insolvency
or bankruptcy of a non-U.S. market or broker are likely to differ from rights that the Series would have in the United States and these
rights may be more limited than in the case of failures of U.S. markets or brokers. 

Possible Governmental Intervention 

Generally, foreign brokers are not subject to
the jurisdiction of the CFTC or any other U.S. regulator. In addition, the Series assets held outside of the United States to margin
transactions on foreign exchanges are held in accordance with the client assets protection regime and the insolvency laws of the applicable
jurisdiction. A foreign government might halt trading in a market and/or take possession of the Series assets maintained in its
country in which case the assets may never be recovered. The Managing Owner and the Series might have little or no notice that such events
were happening. In such circumstances, the Managing Owner may not be able to obtain the Series assets. 

Relatively New Markets 

Some foreign exchanges on which the Series trade
may be in developmental stages so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price patterns. 

15 

Exchange-Rate Exposure 

The Series are valued in U.S. dollars. Contracts
on foreign exchanges are usually traded in the local currency. The Series assets held in connection with contracts priced and settled
in a foreign currency may be held in a foreign depository in accounts denominated in a foreign currency. Changes in the value of the local
currency relative to the U.S. dollar could cause losses to the Series even if the contract traded is profitable. 

Assets held in accounts
at U.S. banks may not be fully insured. 

The assets of each Trading Company or Galaxy Plus
entity that are deposited with commodity brokers or their affiliates may be placed in deposit accounts at U.S. banks. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation FDIC generally insures all deposit accounts of any one accountholder held at any one insured U.S.
bank for up to 250,000 in the aggregate. If the funds in an account can be traced back to multiple individual co-owners, then each co-owner
may be separately entitled to up to 250,000 in coverage. This 250,000 maximum amount of deposit insurance coverage was made permanent
by the Dodd-Frank Act. Uninsured depositors also may receive funds in the event of a receivership of the bank holding the deposit
accounts, but uninsured depositors have a lower priority in respect of payment than insured depositors or certain other creditors, and
frequently there are insufficient funds in a receivership estate to pay off uninsured depositors fully or at all. If the FDIC were to
become receiver of an insured U.S. bank holding deposit accounts that were established by a commodity broker or one of its affiliates,
then it is uncertain whether the commodity broker, the affiliate involved, the Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity, the Series involved,
or the investor would be able to reclaim cash in the deposit accounts in the full amount. 

Exchanges of futures for physicals
may adversely affect performance. 

Certain Trading Advisors may engage in exchanges
of futures for physicals for client accounts. An exchange of futures for physicals is a transaction permitted under the rules of many
futures exchanges in which two parties holding futures positions may close out their positions without making an open, competitive trade
on the exchange. Generally, the holder of a short futures position buys the physical commodity, while the holder of a long futures position
sells the physical commodity. The prices at which such transactions are executed are negotiated between the parties. If a Trading Advisor
engaging in exchanges of futures for physicals were prevented from such trading as a result of regulatory changes, the performance of
client accounts of such Trading Advisor could be adversely affected. 

Cash flow needs may cause positions
to be closed which may cause substantial losses. 

Certain Trading Advisors may trade options on
futures. Futures contract gains and losses are marked-to-market daily for purposes of determining margin requirements. Option positions
generally are not marked-to-market daily, although short option positions will require additional margin if the market moves against the
position. Due to these differences in margin treatment between futures and options, there may be periods in which positions on both sides
must be closed down prematurely due to short term cash flow needs. If this occurs during an adverse move in a spread or straddle relationship,
then a substantial loss could occur. 

Your investment could be illiquid. 

A Trading Advisor may not always be able to liquidate
its commodity interest positions at the desired time or price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a
relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as a foreign government taking political actions
that disrupt the market in its currency or in a major export, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. Alternatively, limits
imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as speculative position limits and daily price fluctuation limits,
may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests. There is no secondary market for the Units, and none is
expected to develop. 

The Trading Advisors trading
is subject to execution risks. 

Although each Series generally will purchase and
sell actively traded contracts, orders may not be executed at or near the desired price, particularly in thinly traded markets, in markets
that lack trading liquidity, or because of applicable daily price fluctuation limits, speculative position limits 
or market disruptions. If market illiquidity or disruptions occur, major losses could result. 

16 

An investment in Units may not diversify
an overall portfolio. 

Historically, managed futures have performed in
a manner largely independent from the general equity and debt markets. If, however, a Series does not perform in a non-correlated manner
with respect to the general financial markets or does not perform successfully, you will obtain little or no diversification benefits
by investing in the Units. An investment in any Series of the Trust could increase, rather than reduce your overall portfolio losses during
periods when the Trust and the equity and debt markets decline in value. There is no way of predicting whether the Trust will lose more
or less than stocks and bonds in declining markets. You should therefore not consider the Units to be a hedge against losses in your core
stock and bond portfolios. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

Markets or positions may be correlated
and may expose a Series to significant risk of loss. 

Different markets traded or individual positions
held by a Series of Units may be highly correlated to one another at times. Accordingly, a significant change in one such market or position
may affect other such markets or positions. The Trading Advisors cannot always predict correlation. Correlation may expose such Series
of Units both to significant risk of loss and significant potential for profit. 

The Trading Advisors positions
may be concentrated from time to time, which may render each Series susceptible to larger losses than if the positions were more diversified. 

One or more of the Trading Advisors may from time
to time cause a Series to hold a few, relatively large positions in relation to its assets. Consequently, a loss in any such position
could result in a proportionately greater loss to such Series than if the Series assets had been spread among a wider number of
instruments. 

Turnover in each Series portfolio
may be high which could result in higher brokerage commissions and transaction fees and expenses. 

Each Trading Advisor will make certain trading
decisions on the basis of short-term market considerations. The portfolio turnover rate may be substantial at times, either due to such
decisions or to market conditions, and this could result in one or more Series incurring substantial brokerage commissions and other transaction
fees and expenses. 

There are certain risks associated
with the Trust s investment in U.S. government debt securities. 

With respect to the portion of the Trust s
assets apportioned for cash management, the Trust may invest in U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed
as to principal or interest by the United States, or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the
government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by Congress of the United States or any certificate of deposit for any of
the foregoing, including U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government (such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie
Mae, or Freddie Mac). U.S. government securities are subject to market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Securities, such as those
issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae or the U.S. Treasury, that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States are guaranteed
only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity and the market prices for such securities will fluctuate.
Notwithstanding that these securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, circumstances could arise that would
prevent the payment of interest or principal. This would result in losses to the Trust. Securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-related
organizations, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and no assurance
can be given that the U.S. government would provide financial support. Therefore, U.S. government-related organizations may not have the
funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. 

The Trust s investment in
U.S. government debt securities will be subject to interest rate risk. 

The Trust s cash management pool includes
investments in U.S. government debt securities that change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates increase, the value of
these investments generally declines. On the other hand, if rates fall, the value of these investments generally increases. U.S. government
securities with greater interest rate sensitivity and longer maturities tend to produce higher yields but are subject to greater fluctuations
in value. Usually, the changes in the value of fixed income securities will not affect cash income generated but may affect the value
of your investment. Given the current low interest rate environment, the risk associated with rising rates is heightened. 

17 

Investments in reference programs
through a swap or other derivative instrument may not always replicate exact exactly the performance of the relevant CTA trading program(s). 

From time to time, certain
Series may invest in reference programs through total return swaps. Such swaps reference an index comprised of shares in segregated investment
portfolios directed by CTAs selected by the Managing Owner. It is possible that the underlying index in respect of any swap owned by a
Series may not fully replicate the performance of the relevant CTA programs in respect of other accounts traded by such CTAs. Further,
the calculation of the underlying index for such swaps may include a deduction for a fee payable to the swap counterparty. Each of these
deductions will mean that the return of such investment will be less than would be the case if no fees were deducted. During the
periods covered by this report, no Series was invested in any derivative instruments including swaps. 

Our
investments and operations are subject to the risk of a potential public health crisis. 

A public health crisis,
pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the recent global outbreak of a disease caused by a novel and highly contagious
form of coronavirus (COVID-19), could have an adverse impact on global, national and local economies, which in turn could negatively
impact the Series. An outbreak such as COVID-19, and the reactions to such an outbreak, are expected to adversely affect the performance
of the U.S. and global economies, including due to market volatility, market and business uncertainty and closures, supply chain and travel
interruptions, the need for employees to work at external locations and extensive medical absences among the workforce. Disruptions to
commercial activity relating to the imposition of quarantines, stay-at-home orders or travel restrictions (or more generally, a failure
of containment efforts) may adversely impact the Series investments. In addition, such restrictions may significantly impair the
ability of the Trading Advisors personnel to travel in connection with potential or existing investments of the Series, which could
negatively impact the ability of such Trading Advisors to effectively identify, monitor, operate and dispose of investments. 

Risks Relating to the Trading Advisors 

There are disadvantages to making
trading decisions based on technical analysis. 

Many of the Trading Advisors, except certain
Trading Advisors trading for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund may base their trading decisions on trading strategies that use mathematical
analyses of technical factors relating to past market performance rather than fundamental analysis. The buy and sell signals generated
by a technical, trend-following trading strategy are derived from a study of actual daily, weekly and monthly price fluctuations, volume
variations and changes in open interest in the markets. The profitability of any technical, trend-following trading strategy depends
upon the occurrence in the future of significant, sustained price moves in some of the markets traded. 

A danger for trend-following traders is whip-saw
markets, that is, markets in which a potential price trend may start to develop but reverses before an actual trend is realized. A pattern
of false starts may generate repeated entry and exit signals in technical systems, resulting in unprofitable transactions. In the past,
there have been prolonged periods without sustained price moves. Presumably these periods will continue to occur. Periods without sustained
price moves may produce substantial losses for trend-following trading strategies. Further, any factor that may lessen the prospect of
these types of moves in the future, such as increased governmental control of, or participation in, the relevant markets, may reduce the
prospect that any trend- following trading strategy will be profitable in the future. 

18 

There are disadvantages to making
trading decisions based on fundamental analysis. 

Certain Trading Advisors will base their decisions
on trading strategies which utilize in whole or in part fundamental analysis of underlying market forces. Fundamental analysis attempts
to examine factors external to the trading market which affect the supply and demand for a particular commodity interest in order to predict
future prices. Such analysis may not result in profitable trading because certain Trading Advisors may not have knowledge of all factors
affecting supply and demand or may incorrectly interpret the information they do have. Furthermore, prices may often be affected by unrelated
or unexpected factors and fundamental analysis may not enable the Trading Advisor to determine whether its previous decisions were incorrect
in sufficient time to avoid substantial losses. In addition, fundamental analysis assumes that commodity markets are inefficient i.e., that
commodity prices do not always reflect all available information which some market analysts dispute. 

Discretionary decision-making may
result in missed opportunities or losses. 

Because each of the Trading Advisors strategies
involves some discretionary aspects in addition to analysis of technical factors, certain Trading Advisors may occasionally use discretion
in investing the assets of a Series. For example, the Trading Advisors often use discretion in selecting contracts and markets to be followed.
In exercising such discretion, such Trading Advisor may take positions opposite to those recommended by the Trading Advisor s trading
system or signals. Discretionary decision making may also result in a Trading Advisor s failing to capitalize on certain price trends
or making unprofitable trades in a situation where another trader relying solely on a systematic approach might not have done so. Furthermore,
such use of discretion may not enable the Series to avoid losses, and in fact, such use of discretion may cause the Series to forego profits
which it may have otherwise earned had such discretion not been used. 

Increased competition from other
systematic traders could reduce the Trading Advisors profitability. 

There has been a dramatic increase over the past
15 to 25 years in the amount of assets managed pursuant to trading systems like those that some of the Trading Advisors may employ. This
means increased trading competition among a larger number of market participants for transactions at favorable prices, which could operate
to the detriment of some or all Series by preventing the Trading Advisors from effecting transactions at the desired prices. It may become
more difficult for the Trading Advisors to implement their trading strategies if other commodity trading advisors using technical systems
are attempting to initiate or liquidate commodity interest positions at the same time as the Trading Advisors. The more competition there
is for the same positions, the more costly and harder they will be to acquire. 

The incentive fees could be an incentive
to the Trading Advisors to make riskier investments. 

The Managing Owner pays each Trading Advisor incentive
fees based on the trading profits earned by it for the applicable Series, including unrealized appreciation on open positions. Accordingly,
it is possible that the Managing Owner will pay an incentive fee on trading profits that do not become realized. Also, because the Trading
Advisors are compensated based on the trading profits earned, each of the Trading Advisors has a financial incentive to make investments
that are riskier than might be made if a Series assets were managed by a Trading Advisor that did not receive performance-based
compensation. 

The risk management approaches of
one or all of the Trading Advisors may not be fully effective, and a Series may incur losses. 

The mechanisms employed by each Trading Advisor
to monitor and manage the risks associated with its trading activities on behalf of the Series for which it trades may not succeed in
mitigating all identified risks. Even if a Trading Advisor s risk management approaches are fully effective, it cannot anticipate
all risks that it may face. If one or more of the Trading Advisors fails to identify and adequately monitor and manage all of the risks
associated with its trading activities, the Series for which it trades may suffer losses. 

Increases in assets under management
of any of the Trading Advisors could lead to diminished returns. 

We believe that none of the Trading Advisors intend
to limit the amount of additional equity that it may manage, and each will continue to seek major new accounts. However, the rates of
returns achieved by a Trading Advisor often diminish as the assets under its management increase. This can occur for many reasons, including
the inability of the Trading Advisor to execute larger position sizes at desired prices and because of the need to adjust the Trading
Advisor s trading program to avoid exceeding speculative position limits. 

19 

These limits are established by the CFTC and the
exchanges on the number of speculative futures and options contracts in a commodity that one trader may own or control. Furthermore, if
the Trading Advisors for a Series, including through a Galaxy Plus entity, cannot manage any additional allocations from the Trust, the
Managing Owner may add additional Trading Advisors for such Series who may have less experience or less favorable performance than the
existing Trading Advisors. 

Each Series relies on its Trading
Advisor(s) for success, and if a Trading Advisor s trading is unsuccessful, the Series may incur losses. 

The Trading Advisor(s) for each Series will make
the commodity trading decisions for that Series. Therefore, the success of each Series depends on the judgment and ability of the Trading
Advisors. A Trading Advisor s trading for any Series may not prove successful under all or any market conditions. If a Trading Advisor s
trading is unsuccessful, the applicable Series may incur losses. Similarly, the success of each Series that invests in swaps largely depends
on the judgment and ability of the Trading Advisors whose trading programs are referenced by swaps in which such Series invests. 

There are disadvantages associated
with terminating or replacing Trading Advisors, Trading Programs, or Reference Trading Programs 

A Trading Advisor generally is required to recoup
previous trading losses in its trading program or a reference trading program, as applicable, before it can earn performance-based compensation.
However, the Managing Owner and/or the commodity pool operator may elect to replace a Trading Advisor, or any trading program or reference
trading program, that has a loss carryforward. In that case, the trust would lose the free ride of any potential
recoupment of the prior losses of such Trading Advisor, trading program or reference trading program. In addition, the new Trading Advisor,
trading program or reference trading program, or an existing Trading Advisor in respect of a new trading program or reference program,
would earn performance-based compensation on the first dollars of investment profits. 

It is also possible that (i) the advisory
agreement with any Trading Advisor, once it expires, will not be renewed on the same terms as the current advisory agreement for that
Trading Advisor, (ii) if assets of any Series allocated to a particular Trading Advisor, trading program or reference trading program
are reallocated to a new or different Trading Advisor, trading program or reference trading program, the new or different Trading Advisor,
with respect to its applicable trading program or reference trading program, will not manage the assets on terms as favorable to the Series
as those previously negotiated, (iii) the addition of a new Trading Advisor, trading program or reference trading program and/or
the removal of one of the current Trading Advisors, trading programs or reference trading programs may cause disruptions in trading as
assets are reallocated, or (iv) the services of a replacement Trading Advisor, in respect of a trading program, reference program
or otherwise, may not be available. There is severe competition for the services of qualified Trading Advisors, and the Managing Owner
may not be able to retain replacement or additional Trading Advisors on acceptable terms. The effect of the replacement of, or the reallocation
of assets away from, a Trading Advisor, trading program or reference trading program therefore could be significant. 

The Managing Owner s allocation
of the Trust s assets among Trading Advisors may result in less than optimal performance by the Trust. 

The Managing Owner may reallocate assets among
the Trading Advisors in a Series upon termination of a Trading Advisor or retention of a new Trading Advisor, including through divestments
out of, or investments into, Galaxy Plus entities, or at the commencement of any month. Consequently, the net assets for such Series may
be allocated among the Trading Advisors in a different manner than the currently anticipated allocations. The Managing Owner s allocation
of assets of any such Series may adversely affect the profitability of the trading of such Series. For example, a Trading Advisor for
a Series may experience a high rate of return but may be managing only a small percentage of the net assets of such Series. In this case,
the Trading Advisor s performance could have a minimal effect on the NAV of such Series. 

20 

Each Trading Advisor advises other
clients and may achieve more favorable results for its other accounts. 

Each of the Trading Advisors currently manages
other trading accounts, and each will remain free to manage additional accounts, including its own accounts, in the future. A Trading
Advisor may vary the trading strategies applicable to the Series for which it trades from those used for its other managed accounts, or
its other managed accounts may impose a different cost structure than that of the Series for which it trades. Consequently, the results
any Trading Advisor achieves for the Series for which it trades may not be similar to those achieved for other accounts managed by the
Trading Advisor or its affiliates at the same time. Moreover, it is possible that those other accounts managed by the Trading Advisor
or its affiliates may compete with the Series for which it trades for the same or similar positions in the commodity interest markets
and that those other accounts may make trades at better prices than the Series for which it trades. 

A Trading Advisor may also have a financial incentive
to favor other accounts because the compensation received from those other accounts exceeds, or may in the future exceed, the compensation
that it receives from managing the account of the Series for which it trades. Because records with respect to other accounts are not accessible
to investors in the Units, investors will not be able to determine if any Trading Advisor is favoring other accounts. 

The Managing Owner places significant
reliance on the Trading Advisors and their key personnel; the loss of such personnel could adversely affect a Series. 

The Managing Owner relies on the Trading Advisors
to achieve trading gains for each Series, entrusting each of them with the responsibility for, and discretion over, the investment of
their allocated portions of the Trust s assets. The Trading Advisors, in turn, are dependent on the services of a limited number
of persons to develop and refine their trading approaches and strategies and execute the trading transactions. The loss of the services
of any Trading Advisor s principals or key employees, or the failure of those principals or key employees to function effectively
as a team, may have an adverse effect on that Trading Advisor s ability to manage its trading activities successfully or may cause
the Trading Advisor to cease operations entirely. This, in turn, could negatively impact one or more Series performance. Each of
the Trading Advisors is wholly- (or majority-) owned and controlled, directly or indirectly, by single individuals who have major roles
in developing, refining and implementing the Trading Advisor s trading strategies and operating its business. The death, incapacity
or other prolonged unavailability of such individuals likely would greatly hinder these Trading Advisors operations, and could
result in their ceasing operations entirely, which could adversely affect the value of your investment. 

The success of each Series depends
on the ability of the personnel of its Trading Advisor(s) to accurately implement their trading systems, and any failure to do so could
subject a Series to losses. 

The Trading Advisors computerized trading
systems rely on the Trading Advisors personnel to accurately process the systems outputs and execute the transactions called
for by the systems. In addition, each Trading Advisor relies on its staff to properly operate and maintain the computer and communications
systems upon which its trading systems rely. Execution and operation of each Trading Advisor s systems is therefore subject to human
errors. Any failure, inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the Trading Advisors systems and executing transactions could impair
the Trading Advisor s ability to identify profit opportunities and benefit from them. It could also result in decisions to undertake
transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information. This could cause substantial losses. 

Stop-loss orders may not prevent
large losses. 

Certain of the Trading Advisors may use stop-loss
orders. Such stop-loss orders may not effectively prevent substantial losses, and depending on market factors at the time, may not be
able to be executed at such stop-loss levels. No risk control technique can assure that large losses will be avoided. 

Risks Relating to the Galaxy Plus Platform 

The success of each Series depends
on the performance of the Galaxy Plus entities in which each Series invests. 

The assets of each Series are
substantially invested in Galaxy Plus entities, and accordingly, each Series performance depends substantially upon the performance
of each such Galaxy Plus entity. Factors that may significantly affect a Galaxy Plus entity s performance include the investment
strategies selected for it by New Hyde Park and/or such Galaxy Plus entity s trading advisor in their sole discretion, the Galaxy
Plus entity s adherence to the selected strategies, the effectiveness of such strategies and the specific trading activities of
the Galaxy Plus entity s trading advisor, including the trading advisor s selection of financial instruments. Each Galaxy
Plus entity is advised by an independent trading advisor. As a result, many of the risks outlined above with respect to the Trading advisors
of each Series will also apply to the trading advisors of each Galaxy Plus entity. 

21 

The Galaxy Plus Platform is recently
established and has a limited operating history and the Galaxy Plus entities have limited or no operating history or track record. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform was formed in April 2015
and has a limited history of operations. The commodity pools offered on the platform are recently established with a limited operating
history or, in some cases, newly established with no operating history. There is a limited performance history, or in some cases, no performance
history, to serve as a factor in evaluating an investment in the commodity pools on the Galaxy Plus Platform. 

A Series may be one of multiple investors in each Galaxy
Plus entity. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform allows multiple investors
to subscribe for interests in its commodity pools. Investors other than a Series could cause a commodity pool to take, or omit to take,
actions that may adversely affect the performance of, or value of a Series investments in, a commodity pool. 

A Series may incur losses related to other investors 
large redemptions from, or investments into, a Galaxy Plus entity. 

A commodity pool may experience relatively large
redemptions or investments related to actions of other investors in the commodity pool. In the event of such redemptions or investments,
a Trading Advisor to the commodity pool could be required to sell futures, options or other investments or to invest cash at a time when
it is not advantageous to do so, harming the performance of a Series. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform operates
independently from each Series, the Trust and the Managing Owner. 

The commodity pools on the Galaxy Plus Platform operate independently
from each Series, the Trust and the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner will have no control over, or involvement in, the operation and
administration of the commodity pools. New Hyde Park, as the sponsor of the commodity pools, may make operational and administrative decisions
that could adversely affect the performance of the commodity pool and the value of a Series investment in the commodity pool. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform and New
Hyde Park may limit the ability of a Series to invest in, or divest from, a Galaxy Plus entity. 

The Galaxy Plus Platform and/or its Sponsor will have the ability to
restrict investments into, or divestments from, any of the commodity pools on the Galaxy Plus Platform. The success of each Series depends
upon the ability to select Trading Advisors in the Galaxy Plus Platform through investments into, or divestments from, one or more commodity
pools. If investments into or out of a commodity pool are limited or restricted by the Galaxy Plus Platform and/or its Sponsor, New Hyde
Park, the performance of a Series may be adversely affected. 

Cessation of, or changes to, the
operation of the Galaxy Plus Platform could adversely impact the performance of a Series. 

Unlike the Trading Companies managed by the Managing Owner, the on-going
business operations of the Galaxy Plus Platform are administered by New Hyde Park. If New Hyde Park ceases operating, or effects administrative
or other changes to, the Galaxy Plus Platform, a Series may no longer be able to access one or more Trading Advisors available through
commodity pools on the Galaxy Plus Platform. The inability to gain exposure to Trading Advisors through the Galaxy Plus Platform may materially
affect the performance of a Series. 

Investment in Galaxy Plus entities
presents operational, administrative risk to each Series. 

Each Series is subject to certain risks related to the operation and
administration of the Galaxy Plus Platform by New Hyde Park as a result of its investment in one or more commodity pools on the Galaxy
Plus Platform. The investment of each Series in a commodity pool may be adversely affected due to possible human error or fraud on the
part of an employee or agent of New Hyde Park, prohibited trading activity by a commodity pool s Trading Advisors due to a lack
of internal controls or failed trading systems, New Hyde Park s noncompliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and external
events such as service provider failure, hardware or software failure or acts of god. 

22 

The reliance on technology by the
Managing Owner, Trading Advisors, Sponsor Clearing brokers, and Swap Counterparties may lead to loss of data and economic losses. 

In addition, as the use of technology increases,
each Series may be more susceptible to operational risks through breaches in cyber security. A breach in cyber security refers to both
intentional and unintentional events that may cause the Series to lose proprietary information or operational capacity or suffer data
corruption. As a result, each Series may incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with
corrective measures, and/or financial loss. In addition, cyber security breaches of the Series third-party service providers or
issuers in which the Series invest may also subject the Series to many of the same risks associated with direct cyber security breaches. 

The use of multiple Trading Advisors
may result in offsetting or opposing trading positions and may also require one Trading Advisor to fund the margin requirements of another
Trading Advisor. 

The use of multiple Trading Advisors for the Frontier
Diversified Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund may result in developments or positions that adversely affect the respective Series NAV. For example, because the
Trading Advisors trading for the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier
Select Fund, and Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund will be acting independently, such Series could buy and sell the same futures contract,
thereby incurring additional expenses but with no net change in its holdings. The Trading Advisors also may compete, from time to time,
for the same trades or other transactions, increasing the cost to such Series of making trades or transactions or causing some of them
to be foregone altogether. Even though the margin requirements resulting from each Trading Advisor s trading for any such Series
ordinarily will be met from that Trading Advisor s allocated net assets of such Series, a Trading Advisor for the Frontier Diversified
Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, or Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund
may incur losses of such magnitude that such Series is unable to meet margin calls from the allocated net assets of that Trading Advisor.
If losses of such magnitude were to occur, the clearing brokers for the Trading Company(ies) or Galaxy Plus entity(ies) in which such
Series invests its assets may require liquidations and contributions from the allocated net assets of another Trading Advisor for such
Series. 

The Trading Advisors trading
programs bear some similarities and, therefore, may lessen the benefits to the Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier
Select Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Diversified Fund Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier Global Fund of having multiple
Trading Advisors. 

Each Trading Advisor has, over time, developed
and modified the program it will use in trading. Nevertheless, the Trading Advisors trading programs have some similarities. These
similarities may, in fact, mitigate the positive effect of having multiple Trading Advisors for the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier
Masters Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Global
Fund. For example, in periods where one Trading Advisor experiences a draw-down, it is possible that these similarities will cause the
other Trading Advisors to also experience a draw-down. 

Operating Risks 

Past performance is not necessarily
indicative of future performance. 

The Managing Owner has selected each Trading Advisor
to manage the assets of each Series because each Trading Advisor performed well through the date of its selection. You must consider,
however, the uncertain significance of past performance, and you should not rely to a substantial degree on the Trading Advisors 
or the Managing Owner s records to date for predictive purposes. You should not assume that any Trading Advisor s future trading
decisions will create profit, avoid substantial losses or result in performance for the Series comparable to that Trading Advisor s
or to the Managing Owner s past performance. In fact, as a significant amount of academic study has shown, futures funds more frequently
than not under-perform the past performance records included in their prospectuses. The Managing Owner believes that the past performance
of the Trading Advisors may be of interest to prospective investors but encourages you to look at such information as an example of the
respective objectives of the Managing Owner and each Trading Advisor rather than as any indication that the investment objectives of any
Series will be achieved. 

Because you and other investors will acquire,
exchange, and redeem Units at different times, you may experience a loss on your Units even though the Series in which you have invested
as a whole is profitable and even though other investors in that Series experience a profit. The past performance of any Series may not
be representative of each investor s investment experience in it. 

23 

Likewise, you and other investors will invest
in different Series managed by different Trading Advisors. Each Series assets are valued and accounted for separately from every
other Series. Consequently, the past performance of one Series has no bearing on the past performance of another Series. You cannot, for
example, consider the Frontier Balanced Fund s past performance in deciding whether to invest in any other Series. 

The Managing Owner may allocate
notional assets in respect of a Series that are in excess of the NAV of such Series. 

At any given time, the notional assets, which
are the total amount of assets of a Series allocated to Trading Advisors and/or reference programs, including (i) actual funds deposited
in accounts directed by the Trading Advisors or deposited as margin in respect of swaps or other derivative instruments referencing a
reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the Trading Advisors and any reference programs, of a Series may exceed the
NAV of such Series depending on the amount of notional equity that is being utilized. The Managing Owner expects that the notional assets
of each Series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the NAV of such Series and such excess may be substantial to the extent
the Managing Owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility. To the extent that notional assets of a Series are in excess
of NAV, investors should understand that the applicable Series will experience greater volatility as measured by NAV than it would if
the notional assets were maintained at a level equal to NAV. In such case, any losses to the Series will be greater as measured by a percentage
of NAV, as compared to the percentage loss incurred in respect of notional assets. Consequently, the allocation of notional assets in
excess of a Series NAV will magnify exposure to the swings in market prices of futures, forwards, options or other assets held
by a Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity or referenced by a swap or other derivative instrument and result in increased volatility,
and potentially greater losses. You may lose all or substantially all of your investment in a Series. 

Differing levels of fees received
may create an incentive for the Managing Owner to favor certain Series over others. 

The Managing Owner charges the various Series
differing levels of fees. This may create an incentive for the Managing Owner to favor certain Series over other Series in, among other
things, the amount of time and effort spent managing any given Series and the selection of Trading Advisors for a given Series. 

The Managing Owner may terminate,
replace and/or add Trading Advisors in its sole discretion which may disrupt trading, adversely affecting the Net Asset Value of a Series. 

The Managing Owner may terminate, substitute or
retain Trading Advisors on behalf of each Series in its sole discretion. The addition of a new Trading Advisor and/or the removal of one
of the current Trading Advisors may cause disruptions in trading as assets are reallocated and new Trading Advisors transition over, which
may have an adverse effect on the NAV of the affected Series. 

Taxation and Benefits Risks 

You are strongly urged to consult your own tax
advisor and counsel about the possible tax consequences to you of an investment in the Trust. Tax consequences may differ for different
investors, and you could be affected by changes in the tax laws. 

You may have tax liability attributable
to your investment in a Series even if you have received no distributions and redeemed no Units, and even if the Series generated an economic
loss. 

If a Series has profit for a taxable year (as
determined for federal income tax purposes), the profit will be includible in your taxable income, whether or not cash or other property
is actually distributed to you by the Series. The Managing Owner does not intend to make any distributions from any Series. Accordingly,
your liability for federal income taxes as well as other taxes on your allocable share of a Series profits will exceed the amount
of distributions to you, if any, for a taxable year. As such, you must be prepared to satisfy any tax liability from redemptions of Units
or other sources. In addition, a Series may have capital losses from trading activities that cannot be deducted against the Series 
interest income, so that you may be subject to pay taxes on interest income even if the Series generates a net economic loss for a taxable
year. 

24 

You may be subject to tax on gains
that the Trust never realizes. 

Because a substantial portion of the Trust s
open positions are marked-to-market at the end of each taxable year, all or a portion of your tax liability for each taxable
year may be based on unrealized gains that the Trust may never actually realize. 

Partnership treatment is not assured,
and if the Trust or any Series is not treated as a Partnership, you could suffer adverse tax consequences. 

It is expected that each of the Trust s
Series will be treated as a separate partnership for federal income tax purposes and, assuming that at least 90 of the gross income of
the Trust and each Series each taxable year has always constituted and will continue to constitute qualifying income within
the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 the Code ), neither the Trust nor any Series will be
a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation. The Managing Owner believes that it is likely, but not certain, that the Trust,
and each Series, will meet this income test. The Trust has not requested, and does not intend to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (the IRS ), concerning its tax treatment or the tax treatment of any Series. 

If the Trust, or any Series, were to be treated
as a corporation for federal income tax purposes: the net income of the Trust, or the Series, would be subject to tax at corporate income
tax rates, thereby substantially reducing its distributable cash; you would not be allowed to deduct losses of the Trust, or a Series;
and distributions to you, other than liquidating distributions, would constitute dividends to the extent of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits of the Trust, or a Series, and would be taxable as such. 

There is the possibility of a tax
audit which could result in additional taxes to you. 

The Trust s tax returns may be audited by
a taxing authority, and such an audit could result in adjustments to the Trust s returns. If an audit results in an adjustment,
you may be compelled to file amended returns and to pay additional taxes plus interest and penalties. 

You will likely recognize short-term
capital gain. 

Profits on futures contracts traded in regulated
U.S. and some foreign exchanges, foreign currency contracts traded in the interbank market, and U.S. and some foreign exchange-traded
options on commodities treated as Section 1256 contracts under the Code are generally treated as short-term capital gain to the extent
of 40 of gains with respect to section 1256 contracts. Special rules apply in the case of mixed straddles (generally, offsetting positions
where some, but not all, of the positions are marked-to-market). These special rules could have the effect of limiting the amount of gain
treated as long-term capital gain. 

The IRS could challenge allocations
of recognized gains to Unitholders who redeem. 

The trust agreement provides that recognized gains
may be specially allocated for tax purposes to redeeming limited owners. If the IRS were to successfully challenge such allocations, each
remaining limited owner s share of recognized gains would be increased. 

The IRS could take the position
that deductions for certain Trust expenses are subject to various limitations. 

Non-corporate taxpayers are subject to certain
limitations for deductions for investment advisory expenses for federal income tax and alternative minimum tax purposes.
The IRS could argue that certain expenses of the Trust are investment advisory expenses. 

25 

The investment of Benefit Plan Investors
may be limited and/or Subject to Mandatory Redemption if any or all of the Series (or Class of any Series) are deemed to hold plan assets
or if the Trading Advisors have fiduciary relationships with certain investing Benefit Plan Investors and Benefit Plan Investors are required
to consider their fiduciary responsibilities in making an investment decision . 

Special considerations apply to investments in
the Trust by individual retirement accounts, pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, Keogh, welfare benefit and other employee benefit plans
whether or not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
each a Plan, a Plan that is subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or an ERISA Plan, and
any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of a Plan s investment in such entity is referred to as a Benefit
Plan Investor. While the assets of the Trust or any Series (and Class of any Series) are intended not to constitute plan assets
with respect to any Benefit Plan Investors, the United States Department of Labor, or the DOL, IRS or a court could disagree. If the DOL,
IRS or a court were to find that the assets of some or all of the Series (or Class of any Series) are the assets of Benefit Plan Investors,
the Managing Owner and the Trading Advisors to such Series (or Class) may be fiduciaries and certain transactions in or by the Trust could
be prohibited. For example, if the Trust were deemed to hold plan assets, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101,
the Trading Advisors may have to refrain from directing certain transactions that are currently contemplated. Furthermore, whether or
not the Trust is deemed to hold plan assets, if a Benefit Plan Investor has certain pre-existing relationships with the Managing Owner,
one or more Trading Advisors, the selling agents or a Clearing Broker, investment in a Series may be limited or prohibited. In the event
that, for any reason, the assets of any Series (or Class of any Series) might be deemed to be plan assets, and if any transactions
would or might constitute prohibited transactions under ERISA or the Code and an exemption for such transaction or transactions is not
available or cannot be obtained (or the Managing Owner determines not to seek such exemption), the Managing Owner reserves the right,
upon notice to, but without the consent of any limited owner, to mandatorily redeem Units held by any limited owner that is a Benefit
Plan Investor. Furthermore, whether or not a Series (or Class of any Series) are plan assets, Benefit Plan Investors should consider their
fiduciary responsibilities before making a decision to invest in a Series (or Class of any Series) and Plan investors who are not subject
to ERISA may be subject to similar responsibilities under state, local, or non-U.S. law. 

Foreign investors may
face exchange rate risk and local tax consequences. 

Foreign investors should note that the Units are
denominated in U.S. dollars and that changes in the rates of exchange between currencies may cause the value of their investment to decrease. 

Regulatory Risks 

Regulation of the commodity interest
markets is extensive and constantly changing; future regulatory developments are impossible to predict, but may significantly and adversely
affect the Trust. 

The futures, options on futures and security
futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. With respect to traditional futures exchanges,
the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the
retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily limits and the suspension
of trading. The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to
ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. In addition, various national governments have expressed concern regarding the
disruptive effects of speculative trading in the currency markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect
of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse. 

26 

The Series, the Trading Companies
or Galaxy Plus entities are subject to speculative position limits. 

The U.S. futures exchanges have established speculative
position limits (referred to as position limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person or group
of persons may hold or control in particular futures and options on futures. Most exchanges also limit the amount of fluctuation in commodity
futures contract prices on a single trading day. Therefore, a Trading Advisor may have to modify its trading instructions or reduce the
size of its positions in one or more futures or options contracts in order to avoid exceeding such position limits, which could adversely
affect the profitability of the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities. The futures exchange may amend or adjust these position limits
or the interpretation of how such limits are applied and adversely affect the profitability of the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities.
In addition, in October 2011, the CFTC adopted rules governing position limits on futures (and options on futures) on a number of agricultural,
energy and metals commodities, as well as on swaps that perform a significant price discovery function with respect to those futures and
options. In September 2012, the CFTC s rules were vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded
to the CFTC for further consideration. The CFTC initially proposed revised position limits rules late in 2013 and re-proposed further
revised position limits rules late in 2016 with respect to speculative positions in 25 core physical commodity futures contracts and their
 economically equivalent futures, options, and swaps. The comment period for the rules closed in February 2017. The date
for the CFTC s final rules is unknown. It is possible that these rules may take effect in some form. If so, these rules could have
an adverse effect on the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities trading. 

CFTC registrations could be terminated
which could adversely affect the Trust or a Series. 

If the CEA registrations or NFA memberships of
the Managing Owner or the registered Trading Advisors were no longer effective, these entities would not be able to act for the Trust,
which could adversely affect the Trust or such Series. 

The foregoing risk factors are not a complete
explanation of all the risks involved in purchasing interests in a fund that invests in the highly speculative, highly leveraged trading
of futures, forwards and options. You should read this entire Form 10-K and the Prospectus before determining to subscribe for Units. 

Item 2. 
 PROPERTIES . 

The Trust does not own or use any physical properties
in the conduct of its business. Its assets currently consist of cash items, Treasury Notes, and, through each Trading Company or Galaxy
entity, U.S. and international futures and forward contracts and other interests in derivative instruments, including options contracts
on futures forwards and swap contracts. The Managing Owner s main office is located at 25568 Genesee Trail Road, Golden, Colorado
80401.

 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES . 

No Units in any Series are publicly traded. The
Units in each Series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on a daily basis, subject to a notice requirement as set forth in the Prospectus.
Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, Units will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100 of the NAV per Unit of the
applicable Series, calculated as of the point described in the Prospectus. The redemption of Units has no impact on the value of
Units that remain outstanding. The Managing Owner may temporarily suspend redemptions under limited circumstances described in the
Prospectus. The right to obtain redemption of Units of a Series is contingent upon such Series having property sufficient to discharge
its liabilities on the date of redemption. 

Further, if a Limited Owner redeems all or a portion
of its Class 1 and 1a Units of any Series on or before the end of twelve full months following the effective date of the purchase of the
Units being redeemed, such Limited Owner is charged a redemption fee of up to 2.0 of the NAV at which the Units are redeemed. The redemption
fee charged will depend on, among other things, the particular Series of Units being redeemed. The Trust Agreement also contains restrictions
on the transfer or assignment of the Units. 

The Managing Owner has the sole discretion in
determining what distributions, if any, the Trust will make to the Limited Owners. The Trust has not affected distributions on the Units
in any Series as of the date hereof and the Managing Owner does not intend to affect any distributions in the foreseeable future. 

The proceeds of offerings are deposited in the
bank and brokerage accounts of the Trust, the Trading Companies and the Galaxy Plus entities for the purpose of engaging in trading activities
in accordance with the Trust s trading policies and its Trading Advisors respective trading strategies.

Item 7. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed
on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation 4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized
to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for
in separate and distinct records separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term
will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). 

The Trust, with respect to each Series of Units,
engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options
contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps). The Trust allocates funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion
of the applicable Trading Company s or Galaxy Plus entity s assets, and make the trading decisions for the assets of
each Series vested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be segregated
from the assets of each other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the value of
the Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the investment
programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust s structure
and business activities, see Item 1 BUSINESS. For a discussion of fees paid by the Trust, see Item 11 EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting policies and make
estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Trust s financial statements. The Trust s most significant accounting
policy, described below, includes the valuation of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap contracts, U.S. Treasury
securities and investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. The majority of these investments are exchange
traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with valuation based on third-party
quoted dealer values on the Interbank market. 

The Trust s other significant accounting
policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements. 

Investment Transactions and Valuation 

The Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and
type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust s financial statements and related disclosures
and has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , and implemented
the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities. 

The Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are
consistent with the market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange
traded) contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in
a consistent manner for each asset or liability. The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Statements of Financial Condition,
with changes in fair value reported as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Statements of Operations. 

Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions
market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or
unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would
use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

In addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit
risk and incorporates any identified risk factors when assigning input levels to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
identical financial assets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented
in Note 3 of the financial statements Fair Value Measurements . 

29 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust will raise additional capital only through
the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature
of the Trust s business, it makes no capital expenditures and has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets. 

The Managing Owner is responsible for the payment
of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and the offering of each Series of Units, except for the
initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100 of each Series 
offering proceeds are initially available for that Series trading activities. 

A portion of each Trading
Company s assets is used as margin to maintain that Trading Company s forward currency contract positions, and another portion
is deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers
in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. At December 31, 2022, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was 320,241 for the
Trust. The clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80 -100 of the interest earned on its average
net assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 4.25 to 4.50 , this amount
is estimated to be 4.25 . In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin assets in
U.S. government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled
by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress or any certificate
of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government,
and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including US. treasury
Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to 2 (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier
Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select
Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier
Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 100 of the interest is retained by the respective Series.
The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding
the 2 paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero. 

Approximately 75 to 95 of the Trust s
assets are expected to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective
broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. treasury bills in
segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the CEA and regulations there under. The remaining approximately 5 to 25 of
the Trust s assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money market funds and time
deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered banks. As of December 31,
2022, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were 46,604 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, 38,703 for the Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, 18,560 for the Frontier Masters Fund, 221,344 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, 33,183 for the Frontier Select
Fund, 26,333 for the Frontier Global Fund, and 45,466 for the Frontier Heritage Fund. 

As a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash
positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures, forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally,
the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund redemptions. As of December 31, 2022, the redemptions payable were 12,788
for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, 35,051 for the Frontier Balanced Fund and 19,922 for the Frontier Masters Fund. During the
year ended December 31, 2022, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions on a timely basis. 

30 

Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

The term off-balance sheet risk 
refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation
or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements
of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly
influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should
move against all of the futures interests positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading
Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets
and the holders of Units of such Series would realize a 100 loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time
monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading
Advisor s margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35 although the actual ratio could be higher or lower
from time to time. 

In addition to market risk, trading futures forward
and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company.
The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange.
In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting
from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse
is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial
institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals markets in which performance is the responsibility
only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing
corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty. 

In the case of forward contracts traded on the
interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution,
rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading
Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued
each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able
to meet its obligations to any Trading Company. 

The Trust has entered into agreements, which provide
for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against
losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements. The Trust s
individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Disclosure of Contractual Obligations 

The business of the Trust is the speculative trading
of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust s futures and forward positions, which may be categorized as purchase
obligations under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That is, they are held for less than one year. Because
the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term
liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust s Statement of Financial Condition, a table of contractual obligations
has not been presented. 

Results of Operations for the Twelve Months
Ended December 31, 2022 

Series Returns and Other Information 

The returns for each Series and Class of Units for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022, and related information, are discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a combined consolidated basis are
explained through the activity of each underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series activities in relation to the Trust
on a combined consolidated basis. 

31 

Each Series had exposure to commodity interest
positions within one or more sectors during fiscal 2022. The performance of each Series was impacted over the course of the year by, among
other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within those sectors, the changing allocations
among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series Trading Advisors in, the relevant sector(s) and commodities, and the timing
of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at the end of the relevant discussion. Each
chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series positions within each of the relevant sectors (determined by the Managing
Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional allocation of the fees and expenses
chargeable to the Series) during the fourth quarter (except as otherwise noted) and for the full calendar year. Charts depicting the performance
of the various Series positions within each of the relevant sectors during the prior three quarters were included in the Trust s
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q previously filed.

Results of Operations for the Twelve Months
Ended December 31, 2020 

The returns for each Series and Class of Units
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,
located within Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Item 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK . 

The Trust is a speculative commodity pool. The
market sensitive instruments, which are held by the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities in which the Series are invested, are acquired
for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Series assets are subject to the risk of trading loss.
Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Series main line of business. 

Market movements result in frequent changes in
the fair market value of each Trading Company s open positions and, consequently, in each Series of the Trust s earnings and
cash flow. The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities and consequently the Series market risk is influenced by
a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value
of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which
trades are made. 

Each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity rapidly
acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict
how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the past performance for any Series is not necessarily indicative
of the future results of such Series. 

Additional risk of trading loss from investment
in an unaffiliated Trading Company may result from the Managing Owner s inability to directly control or stop trading in the event
of exercise of certain withdrawal provisions in the investment agreement. 

The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities,
and consequently the Series primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the Trading Advisors
for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results
of the Trust s and the Managing Owner s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government
interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes
in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material
losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities and consequently the Trust. There can be no assurance that the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities current
market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the
short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in a Series. 

Quantitative Market Risk 

The Series approximate risk exposure in
the various market sectors traded by its Trading Advisors is quantified below in terms of value at risk. Due to the Series mark-to-market
accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Series (through the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities) open positions is
directly reflected in the Series earnings, realized or unrealized gain/loss. 

63 

Exchange maintenance margin requirements have
been used by the Trust as the measure of its value at risk. Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the
maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 to 99 of any one-day interval. The maintenance
margin levels are established by brokers, dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market
volatility and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.
Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit risk
component that is not relevant to value at risk. 

In the case of market sensitive instruments that
are not exchange-traded, including currencies and some energy products and metals, the margin requirements for the equivalent futures
positions have been used as value at risk. In those cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available, dealers margins
have been used. 

In the case of contracts denominated in foreign
currencies, the value at risk figures include foreign currency margin amounts converted into U.S. dollars with an incremental adjustment
to reflect the exchange rate risk inherent to the Series, which is valued in U.S. dollars, in expressing value at risk in a functional
currency other than U.S. dollars. 

In quantifying each Series value at risk,
100 positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements
applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate value at risk. The diversification
effects resulting from the fact that the Series positions held through the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities are rarely,
if ever, 100 positively correlated have not been reflected. 

Value at Risk by Market Sectors 

The following tables present the trading value
at risk associated with each Series exposure to open positions (as held by the Trading Companies) by market sector as of December
31, 2022 and 2021. All open position trading risk exposures of the Series have been included in calculating the figures set forth below.

Material Limitations on Value at Risk as
an Assessment of Market Risk 

The face value of the market sector instruments
held on behalf of the Series is typically many times the applicable maintenance margin requirement, which generally ranges between approximately
1 and 10 of contract face value, as well as many times the capitalization of the Series. The magnitude of each Series open positions
creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of their positions, certain market conditions,
although unusual, but historically recurring from time to time, could cause a Series to incur severe losses over a short period of time.
The value at risk table above, as well as the past performance of the Series, gives no indication of this risk of severe losses. 

Non-Trading Risk 

The Series have non-trading market risk on their
foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances, as well as the market risk they represent, are immaterial. The Series
also have non-trading market risk as a result of investing a portion of their available assets in U.S. government securities which include
any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as
an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress of the U.S. or any certificate of deposit for
any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash
items such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (under three months) and time deposits. The market risk represented by these
investments is also immaterial. 

Qualitative Market Risk 

The following are the primary trading risk exposures
of the Series of the Trust as of December 31, 2022, by market sector. 

Interest Rates 

Interest rate risk is one of the principal market
exposures of each Series. Interest rate movements directly affect the price of interest rate futures positions held and indirectly the
value of a Trading Company s stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest
rate movements between countries materially impact profitability. The primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations
in the U.S. and the other G-7 countries. However, the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities also may take futures positions on the
government debt of smaller nations. The Managing Owner anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary market exposure of
each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entities and accordingly of each Series for the foreseeable future. The changes in interest rates
which are expected to have the most effect on the Series are changes in long-term, as opposed to short-term rates. Most of the speculative
positions to be held by the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities will be in medium- to long-term instruments. Consequently, even
a material change in short term rates is expected to have little effect on the Series if the medium- to long-term rates remain steady.
Aggregate interest income from all sources, including assets held at clearing brokers, of up to 2 (annualized) is paid to the Managing
Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund.
For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 1a, Class 2a, Class 3a only), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier
Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 20 of the total interest allocated to each Series was paid to the Managing Owner from
January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017; thereafter 100 of the interest is retained by the respective Series. 

65 

Currencies 

Exchange rate risk is a significant market exposure
of each Series of the Trust in general. For each Series of the Trust in general, currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily
fluctuations that disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are
influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions. The Trading Advisors on behalf of a Series trade
in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates, which are positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Managing
Owner does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Series currency sector will change significantly in the future. 

Stock Indices 

For each Series, its primary equity exposure is
equity price risk in the G-7 countries as well as other smaller jurisdictions. Each Series of the Trust is primarily exposed to the risk
of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and Japanese indices. 

Metals 

For each Series, its metals market exposure is
fluctuations in the price of both precious metals, including gold and silver, as well as base metals including aluminum, copper, nickel
and zinc. Some metals, such as gold, are used as surrogate stores of value, in place of hard currency, and thus have currency or interest
rate risk associated with them relative to their price in a specific currency. Other metals, such as silver, platinum, copper and steel,
have substantial industrial applications, and may be subject to forces affecting industrial production and demand. 

Agriculturals/Softs 

Each Series may also invest in raw commodities
and may thus have exposure to agricultural price movements, which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions
or by political events in countries that comprise significant sources of commodity supply. 

Energy 

For each Series its primary energy market exposure
is in oil, gas and other energy product price movements, often resulting from political developments and ongoing conflicts in the Middle
East. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in
this market. 

Other Trading Risks 

As a result of leverage, small changes in the
price of a Trading Company s positions may result in substantial losses for a Series. Futures, forwards and options are typically
traded on margin. This means that a small amount of capital can be used to invest in contracts of much greater total value. The resulting
leverage means that a relatively small change in the market price of a contract can produce a substantial loss. Like other leveraged investments,
any purchase or sale of a contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in that contract. The Trading Companies and Galaxy
Plus entities may lose more than their initial margin deposits on a trade. 

The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities 
trading is subject to execution risks. Market conditions may make it impossible for the Trading Advisors to execute a buy or sell order
at the desired price, or to close out an open position. Daily price fluctuation limits are established by the exchanges and approved by
the CFTC. When the market price of a contract reaches its daily price fluctuation limit, no trades can be executed at prices outside the
limit. The holder of a contract may therefore be locked into an adverse price movement for several days or more and lose considerably
more than the initial margin put up to establish the position. Thinly traded or illiquid markets also can make it difficult or impossible
to execute trades. The Trading Advisor s positions are subject to speculative limits. The CFTC and domestic exchanges have established
speculative position limits on the maximum futures position which any person, or group of persons acting in concert, may hold or control
in particular futures contracts or options on futures contracts traded on U.S. commodity exchanges. Under current regulations, other accounts
of the Trading Advisors are combined with the positions held by them on behalf of the applicable Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity
for position limit purposes. This trading could preclude additional trading in these commodities by the Trading Advisors for the accounts
of the Series. 

66 

Systematic strategies do not consider fundamental
types of data and do not have the benefit of discretionary decision making. The assets of the Series are allocated to Trading Advisors
that rely on technical, systematic strategies that do not take into account factors external to the market itself (although certain of
these strategies may have minor discretionary elements incorporated into their systematic strategy). The widespread use of technical trading
systems frequently results in numerous Trading Advisors attempting to execute similar trades at or about the same time, altering trading
patterns and affecting market liquidity. Furthermore, the profit potential of trend-following systems may be diminished by the changing
character of the markets, which may make historical price data (on which technical programs are based) only marginally relevant to future
market patterns. Systematic strategies are developed on the basis of a statistical analysis of market prices. Consequently, any factor
external to the market itself that dominates prices that a discretionary decision maker may take into account may cause major losses for
a systematic strategy. For example, a pending political or economic event may be very likely to cause a major price movement, but a systematic
strategy may continue to maintain positions indicated by its trading method that might incur major losses if the event proved to be adverse. 

However, because certain of the Trading Advisors 
strategies involve some discretionary aspects in addition to their technical factors, certain of the Trading Advisors may occasionally
use discretion in investing the assets of a Trading Company. For example, the Trading Advisors often use discretion in selecting contracts
and markets to be followed. In exercising such discretion, such Trading Advisor may take positions opposite to those recommended by the
Trading Advisor s trading system or signals. Discretionary decision making may also result in a Trading Advisor failing to capitalize
on certain price trends or making unprofitable trades in a situation where another trader relying solely on a systematic approach might
not have done so. Furthermore, such use of discretion may not enable the relevant Series of the Trust to avoid losses, and in fact, such
use of discretion may cause such Series to forego profits which it may have otherwise earned had such discretion not been used. 

Qualitative Disclosures Regarding
Means of Managing Risk Exposure 

The means by which the Managing Owner attempts
to manage the risk of the Trust s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. The Managing Owner applies
risk management policies to trading which generally are designed to limit the total exposure of assets under management. In addition,
the Managing Owner follows diversification guidelines which are often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and
correlated groups. 

Cyber Risks and Security 

The Trust s business requires it to use
and store investor, employee and business partner personally identifiable information PII ). This may include, among other
information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. 

The Trust requires usernames and passwords in
order to access its information technology systems. The Trust also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure
the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Trust data or accounts. These security measures are subject to third-party
security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. To help protect investors and the
Trust, the Trust monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances. 

The Trust devotes significant resources to network
security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute
security. To the extent the Trust was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could
materially damage business partner and investor relationships. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Trust s systems
or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Trust s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the Trust could
be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Trust maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy
terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber
risk.

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), for the Trust and each Series as of December
31, 2022 (the Evaluation Date ). Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable
(not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Based
upon its evaluation, the management of the Managing Owner concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the disclosure controls and procedures
for the Trust and each Series were effective to provide reasonable assurance that they are timely alerted to the material information
relating to the Trust and each Series required to be included in the Trust s periodic SEC filing. 

Report on Management s
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of the
Managing Owner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting by the Trust. 

The Managing Owner s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. 

The internal control
over financial reporting for the Trust and each Series includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the
management of the Managing Owner; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of the Trust or any Series. 

68 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding
controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the Trust and each Series as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 report entitled Internal
Control-Integrated Framework . 

Based on that assessment,
the Trust s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

This annual report does
not include an attestation report of the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit the Trust to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Scope of Exhibit 31 Certifications 

The certifications of
the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and the President and Chief Executive Officer, of the Managing Owner as
of December 31, 2022 and as of April 6, 2023 (the date of this filing) are included as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to
this Form 10-K, and apply not only to the Trust as a whole but also to each Series individually.

Section 16(a) Beneficial
Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires an
issuer s directors and certain executive officers and certain other beneficial owners of the issuer s equity securities to
periodically file notices of changes in their beneficial ownership with the SEC. The Trust does not have any directors or officers. However,
the officers of the Managing Owner, as well as the Managing Owner itself, file such notices regarding their beneficial ownership in the
Trust, if any. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert

The Trust does not have a board of directors but
instead is operated and managed by the Managing Owner. The Executive Committee of the Managing Owner has created an audit committee of
the Trust consisting of all of the Executive Committee s members. The Executive Committee of the Managing Owner, in its capacity
as the audit committee for the Trust, has determined that Patrick J. Kane, the Chairman of the Managing Owner, qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Mr. Kane is not independent of management. 

Code of Ethics 

The Trust has not adopted a code of ethics because
it does not have any officers or employees. The Managing Owner has adopted a code of ethics for employees and principals of the Managing
Owner. 

In general, the Managing Owner, its principals,
and all other persons associated with the Managing Owner shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles
of trade in the conduct of their commodity futures business. All employees including anyone not on the regular payroll but filling in
on a temporary basis shall be held to the highest standards of honesty and integrity. This conduct will be valid for all duties involved
with the daily management and responsibilities as Managing Owner of the Trust. 

Employees will conduct their daily duties in a
responsible manner to ensure that all customers are treated fairly and equally. The reputation of the Managing Owner is crucial to its
business and understanding that the Managing Owner will make every effort to ensure the reputation of the Managing Owner is not tarnished
in any way. Employees are urged to seek the advice of their supervisor for any questions applicable to this code relative to their individual
circumstances. 

72 

Item 11. 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION . 

The Trust has no directors or officers. Its affairs
are managed solely by the Managing Owner, which receives compensation for its services from the Trust, as follows: 

Management Fees 

Each Series of Units pays to the Managing Owner a monthly management
fee equal to a percentage of the notional assets of such Series allocated to Trading Companies, calculated on a daily basis. The percentage
basis of the fees varies and are in line with the amounts being disclosed below. In addition, the Managing Owner receives a monthly management
equal to a certain percentage of the assets in the Galaxy Plus entities attributable to such Series (including notional assets),
calculated on a monthly basis. The management fees attributable to Galaxy Plus entities are included in unrealized gain/(loss) on private
investment companies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total amount of assets of a Series allocated to Trading Advisors
and/or reference programs, including (i) actual funds deposited in accounts directed by the Trading Advisors or deposited as margin
in respect of swaps or other derivative instruments referencing a reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the
Trading Advisors and any reference programs, is referred to herein as the notional assets of the Series. The annual rate
of the management fee is: 0.5 for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1 and Class 2, 0.5 for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP,
Class 2a and Class 3a, 2.0 for the Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund Class 1a, Class 2a and Class
3a and Frontier Masters Fund, 0.75 for Frontier Diversified Fund, 2.5 for the Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund, and 3.5 
for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund Class 2 and Class 3. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such management
fees to the Trading Advisor(s) and/or waive (up to the percentage specified) any such management fee to the extent any related management
fee is paid by a trading company or estimated management fee is embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument. Any management fee
embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument may be greater or less than the management fee that would otherwise be charged to the
Series by the Managing Owner. During the periods covered by this report, no Series was invested in a swap. 

The management fee as a percentage of the applicable
Series notional assets will be greater than the percentage of the applicable Series net asset value to the extent that the
notional assets of the Series exceeds its net asset value. The Managing Owner expects that the notional assets of each Series will generally
be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such Series and such excess may be substantial to the extent the Managing
Owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility. 

Trading Fees 

In connection with each Series trading
activities the Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund pays to the Managing Owner
an FCM Fee of up to 2.25 per annum of notional assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity pools
available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and any reference programs of the applicable Series. The Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters Fund pays to the Managing Owner an FCM Fee of up to 2.25 of notional assets allocated to the trading
advisors, including through investments in commodity pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and a custodial/due diligence fee of
0.12 of such Series NAV, calculated daily. 

73 

Incentive Fees 

Some Series pay to the Managing Owner an incentive fee of a certain
percentage of new net trading profits generated in the Trading Companies by such Series, monthly or quarterly. In addition, the Managing
Owner receives a quarterly incentive fee of a certain percentage of new net trading profits generated in the Galaxy Plus entities that
have been allocated to the Series. The incentive fees attributable to Galaxy Plus entities are included in unrealized gain/(loss) on private
investment companies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because the Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier
Masters Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund may each employ multiple Trading Advisors,
these Series will pay the Managing Owner a monthly incentive fee calculated on a Trading Advisor by Trading Advisor basis. It is therefore
possible that in any given period the Series may pay incentive fees to the Managing Owner for one or more Trading Advisors while each
of these Series as a whole experiences losses. The incentive fee is 25 for the Frontier Balanced Fund and the Frontier Diversified Fund
and 20 for the Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters
Fund. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such incentive fees to the Trading Advisor(s) for such Series. 

Interest Income 

Aggregate interest income from all sources, including
U.S. Treasury Securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to the first 2 (annualized) of average net assets
less any fair market value related to swaps is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2), Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier
Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 1a, Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund
(Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), thereafter 100 of the interest is retained by the respective Series. 

Other Fees 

In addition, with respect to Class 1 and Class
1a Units of each Series of the Trust, as applicable, the Series pays monthly or quarterly to the Managing Owner a service fee of up to
3 and 2 annually, for the closed Series and open Series, respectively, which the Managing Owner pays to selling agents of the Trust.

Item 13.

relationships with the Managing Owner and its affiliates. However, there have been no direct financial transactions between the Trust

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Unitholders and the Executive Committee
of Frontier Funds 

Opinions on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition of Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier Balanced
Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global Fund, and Frontier Heritage Fund (collectively the Series as of December 31,
2022 and 2021, including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in owners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2020, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Series as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Series management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Series financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Series in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Series is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Series 
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits of the financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ 

We have served as auditor of the Frontier Funds
Trust since 2019.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Executive Committee of Frontier Funds 

Opinions on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying combined consolidated
statement of financial condition, including the combined consolidated condensed schedule of investments, of the Frontier Funds (the
 Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related combined consolidated statements of operations, changes in
owners capital and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and the related notes to the combined consolidated
financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust s financial statements based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit of the financial statements included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

the aggregate capital, profits and losses of the Trust so long as it is acting as the Managing Owner of the Trust. Such contribution was

regulatory bodies to maintain a interest specifically in the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP Units and Frontier Balanced Fund Class
2a Units, aggregated, and each of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Diversified Fund, and Frontier Masters Fund. The 
interest in these specific Series of the Trust is included in computing the Minimum Purchase Commitment in aggregate capital. In addition

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT 

To the Executive Committee of Frontier Funds 

Opinion 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements
of Frontier Trading Company I, LLC and Frontier Trading Company XXXVIII, LLC 
(collectively, the Trading Companies ), which comprise the statements of financial condition, including the condensed schedules
of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in members equity and cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trading Companies as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described
in the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent
of the Trading Companies and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating
to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial
Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management
is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Trading
Companiesw ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available
to be issued. 

Auditors Responsibilities for the
Audit of the Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material
if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user
based on the financial statements. 

F- 77 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS,
we: 

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trading Companies 
internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the Trading Companies ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged
with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control related matters that we identified during the audit.

A futures contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity of a commodity at a specified time and place. Exposure to futures contracts is done directly by the trading companies or indirectly through an investment in a private investment company that trades futures. 

A forward contract is an individually negotiated contract between principals, not traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date at a specified price. 

An option on a futures contract, forward contract or a commodity gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures contract, forward contract or a commodity, as applicable, at a specified price on or before a specified date. Options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange, while options on forward contracts and commodities, referred to collectively as over-the-counter options, generally are individually negotiated, principal-to-principal contracts not traded on an exchange. 

A swap contract generally involves an exchange of a stream of payments between the contracting parties. Swap contracts generally are not uniform and not exchange-traded. 

The Trust has entered into agreements, which provide
for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against
losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

2. Significant
Accounting Policies 

The following are the significant accounting
policies of the Trading Companies. 

Basis of Presentation The
Trading Companies follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (the FASB ), to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition, condensed schedules of investments, results of
operations, changes in capital and cash flows. The Trading Companies are investment companies and follow ASC 946. 

Receivable from Futures Commission
Merchants The Trading Companies deposit assets with an FCM subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements.
Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of cash with such FCM. The Trading Companies earn interest income on its assets deposited
with the FCM. A portion of the receivable is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the clearing
broker as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 included restricted cash for margin requirements of 320,241 and 818,362 for the
Frontier Trading Company I LLC. 

Use of Estimates The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP may require the management of the Trading Companies to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The valuation of swap contracts requires significant
estimates as well as the valuation of certain other investments. Please refer to Note 3 for discussion of valuation methodology. Actual
results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material. 

Investment Transactions Futures,
options on futures, and forward contracts are recorded on a trade date basis and realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts
are settled. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) are reported
in the Statement of Operations as a Net change in open trade equity, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in
accordance with ASC 210. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Operations.
Fair value of exchange-traded contracts is based upon exchange settlement prices. Fair value of non- exchange-traded contracts is based
on third party quoted dealer values on the interbank market. 

Foreign Currency Transactions 
The Trading Company s functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, they transact business in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. The Series do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments
from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized or unrealized
gain or loss from investments. 

Purchase and Sales of Private
Investment Companies Trading Companies are able to subscribe into and redeem from the Galaxy Plus entities on a weekly basis.
The value of the private investment companies is determined by the Sponsor and reported on a daily basis. The change in value is calculated
as the difference between the total purchase proceeds and the fair value calculated by the Sponsor and is recorded as net unrealized gain/(loss)
on private investment companies on the statements of operations. 

Investments and Swaps The
Trading Companies record investment transactions on a trade date basis and all investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in
fair value reported as a component of realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on investments in the statements of operations. Investments
in private investment companies are valued utilizing the net asset values as a practical expedient. The Trading Companies strategically
invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected at the discretion of management. Swaps are privately negotiated
contracts designed to provide investment returns linked to those produced by one or more underlying investment products or indices. In
a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular
predetermined investment or instrument. The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are calculated
with respect to a notional amount (i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest
rate, return, or other amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a basket of securities. The valuation of
swap contracts requires significant estimates. Swap contracts are reported utilizing Level 3 Inputs. The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Trust s swap contracts are asset liquidity, debt valuation, credit risk, volatility, market
risk, distributions, dividends, risk premiums, and other risk management tools. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs
in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Swap Contracts are reported at fair value based upon
a weekly indicative value that is calculated by management using bid/ask prices from the counterparty. All valuation processes are monitored
by the valuation committee. 

F- 86 

Income Taxes The Trading
Companies apply the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes ASC 740 ), which provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions
should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trading Companies financial statements to determine whether the tax
positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax
at the Trading Company level not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. Management has concluded there is no tax expense, interest or penalties to be recorded by the Trading Companies.
The 2019 through 2022 tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. 

Fees and Expenses The Trading
Companies incur no expenses other than trading commissions resulting from normal trading activity. All operating expenses such as legal,
accounting, etc. are paid for, without reimbursement, by Frontier Fund Management LLC, the Managing Owner of the Trust. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 

In August 2018, FASB issued ASU
2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ASU 2018-13 ). The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair
value measurements. The changes affect all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the
amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may
delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. 

Management is currently evaluating the
impacts ASU 2018-13 will have on the financial statements 

Subsequent Events The Trading
Companies follow the provisions of FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure
of events that occur after the balance sheet date and up through the date the financial statements are issued. Refer to Note 9. 

3. Fair Value Measurements 

In connection with the valuation
of investments, the Trading Companies apply ASC 820. ASC 820 provides clarification that when a quoted price in an active market for the
identical asset or liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using certain techniques. ASC 820
also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, a reporting entity is not required to include a separate
input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of an asset or liability. ASC
820 also clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset or liability at the measurement date and the quoted
price for the identical asset or liability when traded as an asset or liability in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted
price of the asset are required are Level 1 fair value measurements. 

Level
1 Inputs 

Unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical financial assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level
2 Inputs 

Inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted
prices for similar financial assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar financial assets in markets that are not
active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the financial assets or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated
by market data by correlation or other means. 

Level
3 Inputs 

Unobservable inputs for determining
the fair value of financial assets that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would
use in pricing the financial asset. 

F- 87 

The Trading Companies
uses the following methodologies to value instruments within its financial asset portfolio at fair value: 

Trading Securities. These instruments
include open trade equity positions (futures contracts) that are actively traded on public markets with quoted pricing for corroboration.
Futures contracts are reported at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Trading securities instruments further include open trade equity positions
(trading options and currency forwards) that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are not traded on active markets.
Trading options and currencies are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs. 

Swap Contracts. Certain Series
of the Trust strategically invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected at the direction of the Managing Owner.
Swaps are privately negotiated contracts designed to provide investment returns linked to those produced by one or more investment products
or indices. In a typical swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one
or more particular predetermined investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between parties
are calculated with respect to a notional amount (i.e., the amount of value of the underlying asset used in computing the
particular interest rate, return, or other amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a basket of securities. 

Swap contracts are reported
at fair value upon daily reports from the counterparty. In addition, a third party takes the inputs from the counterparty, makes certain
adjustments, and runs it through their pricing model to come up with their daily price. The fair value measurements of the swap contracts
are valued using unadjusted inputs that were not internally developed. The Managing Owner reviews and compares approved current day pricing
of the CTA positions, as received from the counterparty which includes intra-day volatility and volume and daily index performance, as
well as from the third party. Differences in prices exceeding 5 are investigated. Unexplainable differences are escalated to the Managing
Owner s Valuation Committee for evaluation and resolution. The Swap Contracts are reported at fair value using Level 3 inputs. 

Investments in Private Investment
Companies. Investments in private investment companies are valued utilizing the net asset values provided by the underlying private investment
companies as a practical expedient. Each Series applies the practical expedient to its investments in private investment companies on
an investment-by-investment basis, and consistently with the Series entire position in a particular investment, unless it is probable
that the Series will sell a portion of an investment at an amount different from the net asset value of the investment. The Private Investment
Companies are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The Frontier Select Fund (through its investment in an unconsolidated trading
company) and Frontier Heritage Fund Brevan Howard swap investments were liquidated on May 30, 2020 and Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Diversified Fund TRS swap investment were liquidated on December 21, 2020. 

The
following table summarizes the instruments that comprise the Trading Companies financial asset portfolio measured at fair value on a recurring
basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, segregated by the level of valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure

The
Trading Companies assess the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual
date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Trading Company s accounting policy
regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, the Trading Companies did not transfer any assets between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.

4. Swap
Contracts 

In addition to authorizing Trading
Advisors to manage pre-determined investment levels of futures and forward contracts, certain Trading Companies of the Trust will strategically
invest a portion or all of their assets in total return swaps, selected at the direction of management. Swaps are privately negotiated
contracts designed to provide investment returns linked to those produced by one or more investment products or indices. In a typical
swap, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on one or more particular predetermined
investments or instruments. The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are calculated with respect
to a notional amount (i.e., the amount or value of the underlying asset used in computing the particular interest rate,
return, or other amount to be exchanged) in a particular investment, or in a basket of securities. 

Each Trading Company s investment
in swaps will likely differ substantially over time due to cash flows, portfolio management decisions and market movements. The swaps
serve to diversify the investment holdings of each Trading Company and to provide access to programs and advisors that would not be otherwise
available to the Trading Company and are not used for hedging purposes. 

Management follows a procedure
in selecting well-established financial institutions which management, in its sole discretion, considers to be reputable, reliable, financially
responsible and well established, to act as swap counterparties. The procedure includes due diligence review of documentation on all new
and existing financial institution counterparties prior to initiation of relationship, and quarterly ongoing review during the relationship,
to ensure that counterparties meet the managements minimum credit requirements, the counterparty average rating being no less than
an investment grade rating as defined by the rating agencies. 

The Trading Companies strategically
invest assets in one or more swaps linked to certain underlying investments or indices, at the direction of management. The Trading Companies
will not own any of the investments or indices referenced by any swap. In addition, the swap counterparty to the Trading Company is not
a Trading Advisor to these Trading Companies. 

To help to reduce counterparty risk
on the Trading Companies, the Managing Owner has the right to reduce the Trading Companies exposure and remove cash from the Trading
Companies total return swaps with Deutsche Bank AG. The Series are charged interest on this cash holding and any amount removed
will be offset against the final settlement value of the swap. The Frontier Trading Company XXXIX, LLC ceased trading operations on May
30, 2020. The Frontier Trading Company XXXIV LLC, Frontier Trading Company XXXV LLC and Frontier Trading Company XXXVII LLC ceased trading
operations on December 21, 2020. Embedded in the swap fair value is management and incentive fees being paid to Trading Advisors.

companies represent cash and open trade equity invested in the private investment companies as well as the cumulative trading profits
or losses allocated to the Trust by the private investment companies. Private investment companies allocate trading profits or losses
on the basis of the proportion of the Trading Company s capital allocated for trading to the private investment company, which bears
no relationship to the amount of cash invested by the Trading Company in the private investment companies. Investments in private investment
companies are valued using the NAV provided by the underlying private investment.

Certain financial instruments
and derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the statements of financial condition under GAAP. The Series open trade equity/(deficit),
options written, and receivables from futures commissions merchants (each, an FCM are subject to master netting arrangements
and collateral arrangements and meet the U.S. GAAP guidance to qualify for offset. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates
a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. The
Series policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a net basis on the statements of financial condition. 

F- 93

and net information about the Series assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements as disclosed on the statements

8. Trading Activities and Related
Risks 

The purchase and sale of futures
and options on futures contracts require margin deposits with futures commission merchants (each, an FCM ). Additional deposits
may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The CEA requires an FCM to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM s
proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with an FCM are considered
commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM s segregation requirements. In the event of an FCM s insolvency,
recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than
the total of cash and other property deposited. 

The term off-balance sheet
risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the Statement of Financial Condition,
may result in future obligation or loss in excess of the amount paid by the trading Companies for a particular investment. Each Trading
Company expects to trade in futures, options, forward and swap contracts and will therefore be a party to financial instruments with elements
of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts, there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly
influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should
move against all of the futures positions held by a Trading Company at the same time, and if the Trading Advisor(s) of such Trading Company
are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets. Management will seek to minimize
market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio.
It is anticipated that any Trading Advisor s margin-to- equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35 although the actual
ratio could be higher or lower from time to time. 

F- 94 

In addition to market risk, trading
futures, forward and swap contracts entails credit risk in that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company.
The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with
such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial
burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases
where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks
or other financial institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges, are principals markets in which performance
is the responsibility only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction, and not of the
exchange or clearing corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the
counterparty. 

In the case of forward contracts
traded on the interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on exchanges. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial
institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Management expects
the Trading Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company
will be valued each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty
will be able to meet its obligations to any Trading Company. 

Management has established procedures
to actively monitor and minimize market and credit risks. Investors in units of the Frontier Funds bear the risk of loss only to the extent
of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received. 

9. Indemnifications 

The Trading Companies have entered
into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading
advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under
such agreements, except for gross negligence or bad faith. The Trading Companies have had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these
agreements. The Trading Companies individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future
claims that may be made against the Trading Companies that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trading Companies expect
the risk of loss to be remote. 

10. Subsequent Events 

Management evaluated subsequent
events till the date of issuance of this report and noted that there were none that required disclosure.

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund - Quantica
Managed Futures Feeder Fund (507) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - FORT Contrarian Feeder Fund (510) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - Quest Feeder Fund
(517) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - LRR Feeder Fund (522) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - QIM Feeder Fund (526) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - Aspect Feeder
Fund (532) LLC, Galaxy Plus Fund - Welton GDP Feeder Fund (538) LLC and Galaxy Plus Fund - Volt Diversified Alpha Feeder Fund (550) LLC
(collectively, the Funds), which comprise the statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations
and changes in members equity for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively, the financial
statements). 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Funds as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and changes
in members equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Funds and
to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial
Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Funds ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the
Audits of the Financial Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures
include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control. Accordingly,
no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about
the Funds ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audits.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note 1. Organization and Structure 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC (the Onshore Platform was formed in Delaware as a series limited liability company on April 14, 2014. The Onshore Platform is part of the Galaxy Plus Managed
Account Platform (the Platform ). Both are sponsored by New Hyde Park Alternatives Funds, LLC (the Sponsor 
or NHPAF as a means of making available to qualified high net-worth individuals and institutional investors (including
fund of hedge funds) Investors a variety of third-party professional managed futures and foreign exchange advisors Advisors in an investment environment which facilitates access to multiple Advisors without having to negotiate individually with any Advisor,
meet their account minimums, or establish futures and forward dealing accounts. 

Each of the Onshore Platform s respective
series (each a Fund , collectively the Funds invest in a separately formed Delaware limited liability company
(each a Master Fund , collectively the Master Funds ). Unless specified otherwise, each Master Fund is managed
by a different Advisor. Collectively, the Advisors implement a wide range of trading strategies, trade entirely independently from each
other and are not affiliated with the Sponsor. 

The structure of the Platform permits the Funds
to offer Investors a choice of trading leverage levels as well as the ability to adjust such levels in response to changes in Advisor
performance, general market conditions and the Investor s own portfolio objectives. Each Investor s selected trading leverage
is managed by the Sponsor by allocating the Investor s subscription proceeds between the Funds bank accounts and the corresponding
Master Funds. 

Galaxy Plus Fund SPC (the Offshore Platform is part of the Platform and is sponsored by NHPAF primarily for non-U.S. Investors. The Offshore Platform operates in substantially the
same manner as the Onshore Platform and also invests in the same Master Funds. 

NHPAF was formed in October 2013 and its principal
office is located in Wheaton, Illinois. NHPAF is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool
operator and commodity trading advisor, and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA). 

The Platform has appointed the Sponsor, under
the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the LLC Agreement as the managing member of the Onshore Platform.
In such capacity, the Sponsor has the authority, to manage, with wide discretionary powers, the business and affairs of the Onshore Platform
including the authority to select the administrator for the Onshore Platform. The LLC Agreement will continue to remain in force until
terminated by either the Sponsor or the Platform upon not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice. In certain circumstances
(for example, the insolvency of either party or in the event all trading for the Platform by the Advisors are suspended), the LLC Agreement
may be immediately terminated by either party. Capitalized terms throughout these notes are defined in the LLC Agreement. 

In accordance with Delaware law, the assets held
in each Fund shall be applied and held solely for the benefit of the members in such Fund and no member of another Fund shall have any
claim or right to any asset allocated to another Fund. The assets of each Fund shall be applied solely to satisfy only that respective
Fund s liabilities. 

If an asset is not attributable to any particular
Fund, the Sponsor shall have the discretion to determine the basis upon which such asset shall be allocated among the Funds and the Sponsor
shall have the absolute discretion to vary such allocation. If the assets not attributable to any Fund give rise to any net profits, the
Sponsor may, in its absolute discretion, allocate the net profits to any Fund.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Onshore Platform s financial statements. 

Principles of accounting: The accompanying
financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent
reporting of financial condition and results of operations. The Funds are investment companies and follow the accounting and reporting
guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Investments: Each Fund invests its assets
in its respective Master Fund. 

Investment in Master Fund : Each Fund s
investment in its respective Master Fund is carried at fair value and represents the Fund s pro-rata interest in the net assets
of the Master Fund as of the close of business on the relevant valuation date. The assets of each Master Fund are carried at fair value.
At each valuation date, each Master Fund s income, expenses, net realized gain/(loss) and net increase/(decrease) in unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are allocated to the respective Fund, based on the Fund s pro rata interest in the net assets of the
Master Fund, and recorded in the respective Fund s Statement of Operations. The financial statements of the Master Funds are attached
to this report and should be read in conjunction with the Onshore Platform s financial statements. 

Cash: The
Funds maintain deposits with financial institutions in amounts that at times maybe in excess of federally insured limits. The amount of
cash held at the financial institutions is determined by the Investors choice of trading leverage levels respective to the maximum trading
level of the Funds, as determined by the Sponsor. The Funds do not believe they are exposed to any significant credit risk. 

Subscriptions received in advance: Subscriptions
received in advance are subscriptions proceeds received
for the purchase of capital effective subsequent to period end. 

Redemptions payable: Redemptions payable
are redemption proceeds payable for the sale of capital effective prior to period end. 

Receivable/payable from/to Master Fund: 
Generally, receivables and payables from/to Master Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity
at the Master Fund level. 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income
and expense is recognized on an accrual basis and includes the Master Fund s interest income/expense from its broker that is allocated
on a pro rata basis to the respective Fund percentage in the Master Funds on the first day. 

Dividend income/expense: Dividend income
and expense is recognized on an accrual basis and includes the Master Fund s dividend income/expense from its broker that is allocated
on a pro rata basis to the respective the respective Fund based on it s ownership percentage in the respective Master Fund on the first
day of each accounting period.

(A Delaware Series Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: 
Profits and losses for each accounting period are generally allocated, at the discretion of the Sponsor, pro-rata to the members based
on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of the accounting period. 

Income taxes: The Onshore Platform evaluates
tax positions taken or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained
by the applicable tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized
in the financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that had a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. The Funds have determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain
income tax positions taken or expect to be taken with respect to all open tax years. No income tax returns are currently under examination.
The Funds U.S. Federal tax returns remain open for the current and prior three years. 

The Funds are treated as partnerships for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes and, as such, are generally not subject to U.S. Federal, state or local income taxes. The members of the Funds
are liable for their share of all U.S. Federal, state, and local taxes, if any imposed on the net investment income and realized gains
of the Funds. 

Indemnifications and litigations: The Sponsor
and its affiliates are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for the Onshore Platform.
In addition, in the normal course of business, the Onshore Platform enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general
indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be
made against the Onshore Platform. However, the Onshore Platform expects the risk of loss to be remote. From time to time, in the normal
course of business, the Funds may be threatened with, or named as defendants in, lawsuits, arbitrations, and administrative claims. Any
such claims that are decided against the Funds could harm the Funds business. The Funds are also subject to periodic regulatory audits
and inspections which could result in fines or other disciplinary actions. Unfavorable outcomes in such matters may result in a material
impact on the Funds financial position or results from operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Sponsor was not aware of any matters
that would have a material impact on the Funds financial statements. 

Statement of Cash Flows: The Onshore Platform
has elected not to provide Statements of Cash Flows as permitted by U.S. GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year/period, substantially all of the Funds investments were carried at fair value and
classified as Level 1 or Level 2 or were measured using the practical expedient measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Funds had little or no debt during the year/period; 

The Onshore Platform financial statements include Statements of Changes in Members Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions
and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Onshore Platform may accept subscriptions
or redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount,
with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note 3. Classes of Interest and Series 

Four different classes of Interests Interests are currently offered by each Fund: Class A, Class B, Class C and Class EF Interests. Each Class is generally subject to different fees.
Investors are eligible to receive Class A, Class B or Class C Interests depending on their aggregate Trading Level, as discussed in Note
5, on the Platform. 

F- 105 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

(A Delaware Series Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Class A Interests are available to (i) Investors
who make capital contributions with an assigned Trading Level of 25,000,000 or more, as aggregated across all Funds in which capital
contributions are invested, (ii) other collective investment vehicles or commodity pools sponsored by the Sponsor or its affiliates, and
(iii) such other Investors as the Sponsor may determine. Class A Interests are subject to a Sponsor Fee and Sales Commissions and other
fees allocable to Class A Interests as disclosed in the LLC Agreement. 

Class B Interests are available to (i) Investors
who make capital contributions with an assigned Trading Level between 5,000,000 and 24,999,999, as aggregated across all Funds in which
capital contributions are invested, and (ii) such other Investors as the Sponsor may determine. Class B Interests are subject to a Sponsor
Fee and Sales Commissions and other fees allocable to Class B Interests as disclosed in the LLC Agreement. 

Class C Interests are available to Investors who
make capital contributions with an assigned Trading Level of less than 5,000,000, as aggregated across all Funds in which capital contributions
are invested. Class C Interests are subject to a Sponsor Fee and Sales Commissions and other fees allocable to Class C Interests as disclosed
in the LLC Agreement. 

Class
EF Interests are reserved for a strategic investor and not available to other investors without consent from the Sponsor. There is no
stated minimum Trading Level for Class EF Interest. Class EF Interests are subject to a Sponsor Fee and other fees allocable to Class
EF Interests as disclosed in the LLC Agreement. 

Once an Investor becomes eligible for Class B
Interests, any Class C Interests held by such investor will be automatically converted into Class B Interests. Once an Investor becomes
eligible for Class A Interests, any Class B Interests held by such Investor will be automatically converted into Class A Interests. Similarly,
if an investor s aggregate Trading Level falls below the minimum for Class A or Class B, such interests will be converted to Class
B or Class C, as appropriate. All such conversions will occur at the first trading day after such minimum is breached. 

An Investor of Class A, B, or C Interests, which
invests more than once in a Fund, will receive a separate series with respect to each investment. Incentive Fees are calculated separately
with respect to each such series. Series at or above their respective High Water Marks at the end of an Incentive Fee Calculation Period
are subject to consolidation (i.e., roll-up at the discretion of the Sponsor. 

The Sponsor may from time to time offer additional
classes or subclasses of Interest having different rights and privileges (including but not limited to different fees, funding factors,
investment minimums and/or liquidity terms) from those described herein. The issuance of such additional class or sub-class of Interest
will not require Investor s approval; provided, that the terms of any such additional class or sub-class of Interest do not materially
adversely affect the Investors in the applicable Fund as a whole. Such additional class or sub-class of Interest may or may not be generally
available to other Investors.

Transfers into and out of a Fund relating to movement
from one class of Share to another, change in beneficial ownership, and consolidation to an older series may occur from time to time.
Roll-ups are considered transfers for financial reporting purposes. Since the amount of transfers into and out of each Fund offset, such
transfers are not shown in the Funds Statements of Changes in Members Equity. For the year/period ended December 31, 2022,
there were no transfers.

Note 4. Management, Incentive, Sponsor
and Other Fees 

Each Fund class will pay its respective Advisor,
or in the case of Class EF, the managing owner of the member, both asset based (management fee) and performance based (incentive fee)
compensation as outlined in the Supplement. In addition, each Fund class will pay the Sponsor asset based (sponsor fee) compensation and,
if applicable, a selling agent will receive from each Fund class an asset based fee (sales commission). All asset based fees are calculated
on the same uniform fee base which is the beginning of the period Trading Level (as defined in the Supplement and discussed in Note 5)
plus periodic trading profits and losses for the Fund. Investors can be charged different management and incentive fees at the discretion
of the Sponsor. 

Management
Fee : Each Advisor earns a management fee (the Management Fee which is calculated and accrued monthly (prorated for
partial periods) and payable in arrears as of the last business day of each month. The rate at which the Management Fee is calculated
is specific to each Fund and typically ranges from 0 to 3.50 per annum. Each Advisor may enter into fee sharing arrangements with the
Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor will receive a portion of the Management Fee to be paid to such advisor. In addition, the Sponsor
can enter into agreements with Selling Agents in which the Selling Agent will receive a portion of the Management Fee on assets they
introduce to the Funds. The amounts due to the Selling Agents and Sponsor are included in the Management Fee charged to the Funds. During
the year ended December 31, 2022, Management Fees paid to Selling Agents and the Sponsor are as follows:

Incentive Fee: As of the end of each calendar
quarter, each Fund will pay an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to the Advisor equal to the percentage (the Incentive
Fee Rate of the New Net Profit (defined below) attributable to each series of Interest in such Fund. The Incentive Fee Rate is
specific to each Fund and typically ranges from 20 to 30 . 

Any Incentive Fee, if accrued, will also be made
in respect of Interests withdrawn, at the time of such withdrawal, as if the withdrawal date were the end of a calendar quarter. 

New Net Profit means, with respect
to each series of Interest, the amount by which the Net Asset Value of such series of Interest as of the date of determination exceeds
the High Water Mark (defined below) then attributable to such series of Interest. 

Net Asset Value, for purposes of calculating the
Incentive Fee, is calculated prior to reduction for the Incentive Fee being calculated. Net Asset Value is calculated after deduction
for the Management Fee (regardless of whether such Management Fee is paid to an Advisor or to the Sponsor), but prior to deduction for
the Sponsor Fee, Sales Commissions, and/or Operating Expenses. 

High Water Mark means, with respect
to each series of Interest, the greater of: (i) the aggregate Capital Contributions made to such series of Interest; and (ii) the Net
Asset Value of such series of Interest as of the end of the most recent Incentive Fee Calculation Period as of which an Incentive Fee
was made from such series of Interest (after deduction for the Incentive Fee then made). The High Water Mark with respect to a series
of Interest is reduced proportionately when any withdrawal is made from such series of Interest i.e., the High Water Mark immediately
prior to any such withdrawal is multiplied by the fraction of the numerator of which is the Net Asset Value of such series of Interest
immediately after such withdrawal and the denominator of which is such Net Asset Value immediately prior to such withdrawal (Net Asset
Value in each case being calculated prior to reduction for any Incentive Fee). 

As the Incentive Fee is calculated separately
with respect to each investment made by an Investor, an Investor which invests more than once in a Fund is at risk of being subject to
Incentive Fees in respect of capital contributions made at different times even though the overall value of such Investor s investment
in such Fund has declined.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Trading Advisors may enter into side agreements
with various investors changing the management/ incentive fees charged to those investors. Each Advisor may enter into fee sharing agreements
with the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor will receive a portion of the Incentive Fee to be paid to such advisor. The amounts due
to the Sponsor are included in the Incentive Fee charged to the Funds. Pursuant to a fee sharing agreement between the Sponsor and the
Advisor of 550, the Sponsor of 550 earned 3,905 of the Incentive Fees during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The Sponsor, on behalf of the managing owner
of the Class EF members, has entered into separate fee arrangements with the Trading Advisors which results in the managing owner retaining
a portion of both the management and incentive fees charged to the Class EF members. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount
of management fees and incentive fees retained by the managing owner of Class EF members are as follows:

Sponsor
Fee: The Sponsor will receive from each Interest a monthly
sponsor fee (the Sponsor Fee calculated as a percentage (the Sponsor Fee Rate applicable to each Class of
Interests. The Sponsor Fee is calculated and accrued monthly and payable in arrears as of the last business day of each month. The Sponsor
Fee is pro rated for partial periods. The annual Sponsor Fee Rate is 0.25 for Class A Interests, 0.50 for Class B Interests, 0.80 for
Class C Interests, 0.15 for Class EF Interests. 

Sales
Commission : Class A, B and C Interests are
subject to monthly ongoing sales commissions Sales Commissions equal to a percentage (the Sales Commission Rate applicable to each Class of Interest. Sales Commissions are calculated and accrued monthly and payable in arrears as of the last business
day of each month. Sales Commissions are pro-rated for partial periods. Sales Commissions are specific to an Investor and are agreed upon
between the Investor and Selling Agent prior to making a contribution to the Onshore Platform. The Sales Commission Rate generally ranges
between 0 -2 per annum. With the exception of 507 and 550, no sales commissions were charged during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Sales commissions are included in the Sponsor Fee totals on the Statements of Operations. 

F- 109 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC

Notes to Financial Statements 

Professional
Fees and Operating Expenses: The Sponsor will be responsible for paying all ongoing operating costs of each Fund and the Onshore
Platform as the expenses are incurred, including, but not limited to, any administrative, transfer, exchange and withdrawal processing
costs, legal, compliance, regulatory, reporting, filing, escrow, accounting and printing fees and expenses, and any other operating or
administrative expenses related to accounting, research, due diligence or reporting. However, the Master Fund will be responsible for
paying all of its execution and clearing brokerage commissions, Fund set-up and organization expenses (which can be capped at the discretion
of the Sponsor); bank wire fees; fees related to the audit and tax preparation; and extraordinary expenses such as litigation and indemnification. 

The allocation of the audit and tax fees is based
on the number of trading managers that trade on behalf of each respective Fund. The audit and tax preparation fees are recorded as a component
of professional fees in the Statements of Operations, and are recorded in the year when the related services are performed. 

Note 5. Notional Funding 

The ability to customize notional funding in the
various Funds is a special feature of the Onshore Platform. The Sponsor determines each Fund s Maximum Funding Factor (i.e., the
maximum ratio of Trading Level to actual capital invested in such Fund) and may increase or reduce such Maximum Funding Factor at any
time. In establishing a Fund s Maximum Funding Factor, the Sponsor generally considers the Advisor s maximum 5 day drawdown
and its typical margin-to-equity ratio and sets the Maximum Funding Factor to protect against any failure to meet margin calls. 

The leverage used by a Master Fund (i.e., the
ratio of the Trading Level of such Master Fund to the notional amount of the futures, options, and forward contracts held by such Master
Fund) will fluctuate on an ongoing basis. The Advisors will adjust such leverage in response to market conditions and will not maintain
any set relationship between the Trading Level of a Master Fund and the notional amount of the futures, options, and forward positions
held for such Master Fund. The notional amount of the futures, options, and forward contracts held by a Master Fund is likely to exceed
the Trading Level of such Master Fund by a factor of 10 or more. 

Investors customize their notional funding of
their investment in a Fund by choosing an Effective Funding Factor (which must be no greater than the Maximum Funding Factor). The Effective
Funding Factor so chosen is implemented by the applicable Fund by keeping a portion of the capital at the Fund s bank account or,
as the Fund matures, by keeping a certain percentage of an Investor s investment in the Fund s bank account rather than allocating
such capital to the corresponding Master Fund. All capital allocated by a Fund to its corresponding Master Fund is traded at the Maximum
Funding Factor for such Fund. 

Due to market appreciation/depreciation and other
factors, an Investor s Trading Level to actual capital contributed by such Investor will diverge potentially materially
 from such Investor s selected Effective Funding Factor. As a result, the Sponsor will from time to time rebalance allocations
between the corresponding Master Fund and the Fund s bank account in an attempt to reflect the desired Effective Funding Factor.
Such rebalancing is not done pursuant to any predefined parameters but is done at the Sponsor s discretion. 

Note 6. Financial Instruments with off-balance
sheet risk and concentration of credit risk 

At
December 31, 2022, none of the Funds have direct commitments to buy or sell financial instruments, including derivative instruments. Each
Fund does have indirect buy and sell commitments that arise through the positions held by the Master Fund in which each respective Fund
invests. However, as an investor in a Master Fund, each Fund s risk at December 31, 2022, is limited to the fair value of its investment
in the Master Fund.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Managing Member 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund 
Quantica Managed Futures Master Fund (507) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement of financial condition, including the condensed
schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations and changes in members equity for the year
then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
members equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund and the Sponsor have entered into
a tri-party contract (the Trading Agreement with the Trading Advisor pursuant to which the Master Fund s trading
accounts are managed, subject to rights of termination, by the Trading Advisor in accordance with the Program. The Trading Advisor may
alter its Program (including its trading systems and methods and including the addition and/or deletion of any financial interests or
contracts traded in the Master Fund s trading accounts), provided that the Trading Advisor provide prior notice to the Master Fund
and the Sponsor of any material change to the Trading Advisor s Program. From time to time, the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates)
may manage additional accounts, and these accounts will increase the level of competition for the same trades desired for the Master Fund,
including the priorities of order entry. There is no specific limit as to the number of accounts the Trading Advisors (or their affiliates)
may manage. In addition, the positions of all of the accounts owned or controlled by the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) are aggregated
for the purposes of applying speculative position limits. The management, incentive and sponsor fees are paid directly by the Feeder Funds,
and for this reason are not recorded as expenses of the Master Fund. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial statements. 

Principles of accounting: The accompanying
financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition
and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB Account
Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash and restricted cash: Cash held in
the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody of the broker, a portion of which
is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades. The Master Fund may also hold
cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at the clearing broker, of which
 1,755,945 is held in USD and a balance of 466,778 in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash and restricted
cash margin balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily basis relative
to the USD. A portion of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the clearing broker
as of December 31, 2022 included restricted cash for margin requirements of 1,239,304. This cash becomes unrestricted when the underlying
positions to which it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included amounts due to the
broker for unsettled trades of 0. 

Offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts: 
When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with
the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5).

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation and Revenue Recognition: Depending
on the Program and investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue recognition policies. All investments
are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures and options on futures contracts: 
The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Master Fund agrees
to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option contract provides
the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a predetermined exercise
price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference between the original
contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open
contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or received
on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts.
The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized gain or loss is
determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign currency transactions: 
The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts, non-U.S. futures contracts,
and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities and transactions denominated
in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business on the last business day
of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with the unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from the sales of foreign currencies
and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange gain and loss arises from changes
in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading costs: Trading costs generally
consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees. Fees vary by
type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward contracts. Commissions
are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures and options on futures transactions
and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income
and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: 
Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are
allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year. 

Income taxes: The Master Fund will not
be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions taken
or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken
with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022,
remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications: The Sponsor and its affiliates
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for the Master Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Master
Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Master
Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of Cash Flows: The Master Fund
has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and
classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Members Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions
and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or
redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount,
with the approval of the Sponsor.

Note 3 Fair Value Measurements 

The Master Fund s investments are stated
at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is
a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted
prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 Values for
investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market. Since valuations
are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does not entail a significant
degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Values for
investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets for which
all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related to restrictions
on the investments. 

Level 3 Values for
investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the
fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A description of the valuation methodologies applied
to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that
are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors.
These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022.
The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected by various factors such as type of investment and the
volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the marketplace. 

Exchange-traded derivative contracts that are
actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts can include
futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values are based on an underlying such as
interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities. Such derivative contracts are valued
using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying obtained from the applicable exchange
or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and are categorized as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy. 

The Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments
at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that
caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels
of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments
are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative financial instruments speculatively
traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and forward currency contracts (collectively,
derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates, and generally represent future commitments
to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future dates. A derivative contract may be traded
on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and options on futures contracts. OTC derivative
contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts and certain options. Derivatives are subject
to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risks. 

Market risk is the potential for changes in the
value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity and security
prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.
The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according to each respective Program. The Master Fund
is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such
contracts sold short.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may
occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk due to exchange traded derivative
financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual exchanges on which the instruments are
traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized gain for each counterparty for which
a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties. The credit risk exposure
for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing
interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or financial
market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform
due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters,
pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions. The occurrence of global events similar
to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, social and political discord or debt crises and
downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.
It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events
may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of
the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive responses taken by many governments, including
closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as
well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and
in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant
events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires
margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act
requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s
cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds
subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro
rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund has a substantial portion of its
assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency, recovery of the Master Fund s assets on
deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The notional value represents amounts related
to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies upon which the fair value of the futures
contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair value of, and are not necessarily indicative
of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying price changes in relation to variables specified
by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments. Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is
equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund
had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

Note 5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The Master Fund is required to disclose the impact
of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognized assets and liabilities. These
recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable master
netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria: each of the two parties owes the other determinable
amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to
set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The Master Fund is subject to enforceable master
netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain transactions, and reduce the counterparty
risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral posting arrangements at prearranged exposure
levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes traded out of different legal entities of a particular
counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the
need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements may not be specific to each different asset type; in
such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of
default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed under a single agreement with the counterparty.

Note 6. Related Parties 

As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had 103,681
receivable from the Offshore Feeder Fund and 75,672 receivable from the Onshore Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial
Condition. Generally, receivables and payables from/to Feeder Funds are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital
activity at the Feeder Fund level. 

Note 7. Financial Highlights 

Financial highlights of the Master Fund for the
year ended December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived from information presented in the financial
statements. 

Total return (A) 
 47.76 

Ratios to average members equity (B): 

Net investment income (C) 
 0.52 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.01 

(A) Total return is based on the change in average members equity
during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) The total expense and net investment income ratios are computed
based upon weighted-average members equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) The net investment income ratio excludes net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial highlights are calculated for each member
class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions. The total
return and the net investment income ratio would have been lower, and total expense ratio would have been higher if the management, incentive
fees, and sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Funds. 

Note 8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events,
the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through
March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events
that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy
Plus Fund FORT Contrarian Master Fund (510) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement of financial condition, including the
condensed schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations and changes in member s equity
for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In
performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. 

Obtain
an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed. 

Evaluate
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude
whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged
with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control related matters that we identified during the audit.

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial
statements. 

Principles
of accounting: The accompanying financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent
reporting of financial condition and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting
guidance in FASB Account Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash and restricted cash: Cash held in
the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody of the broker, a portion of which
is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades. The Master Fund may also hold
cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at the clearing broker, of which
 507,856 is held in USD and a balance payable of (20,979) in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash and
restricted cash margin balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily
basis relative to the USD. A portion of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the
clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included restricted cash for margin requirements of 232,475. This cash becomes unrestricted
when the underlying positions to which it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included
amounts due to the broker for unsettled trades of 0. 

Offsetting
of amounts related to certain contracts: When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts
recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (See Note 5).

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation and Revenue Recognition: Depending on the
Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue recognition policies. All investments are
recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures and options on futures contracts: 
The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Master Fund agrees
to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option contract provides
the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a predetermined exercise
price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference between the original
contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open
contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or received
on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts.
The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized gain or loss is
determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign currency transactions: 
The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts, non-U.S. futures contracts,
and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities and transactions denominated
in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business on the last business day
of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with the unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from the sales of foreign currencies
and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange gain and loss arises from changes
in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading costs: Trading costs generally
consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees. Fees vary by
type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward contracts. Commissions
are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures and options on futures transactions
and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income and expense is recognized
on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: Profits and
losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are allocated pro-rata
to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Income taxes: The Master Fund will not
be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions taken
or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken
with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022
remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties. 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications: The Sponsor and its affiliates are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The Master Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Master
Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Master
Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of Cash Flows: The Master Fund
has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and
classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement
of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions and redemptions
can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business day, the first business
day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or redemptions more frequently
than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount, with the approval of the
Sponsor.

Note 3. Fair Value
Measurements 

The Master Fund s investments are stated at fair value
in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in
active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 Values for investments
classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market. Since valuations are based
on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does not entail a significant degree
of judgment. 

Level 2 Values for investments
classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets for which all significant
inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related to restrictions on the investments. 

Level 3 Values for investments
categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value and
unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A description of the valuation methodologies applied to the
Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that are used
in determining fair value of an investment may include price information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. These
inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022. The availability
of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected by various factors such as type of investment and the volume and level
of activity for that investment or similar investments in the marketplace. 

Exchange-traded derivative contracts that are actively traded
are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts can include futures contracts,
option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values are based on an underlying such as interest rates, foreign
currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities. Such derivative contracts are valued using observable market
data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying obtained from the applicable exchange or market. OTC derivative
contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

The Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments at each
measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the
transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair
value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are
not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative financial instruments speculatively traded by the
Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and forward currency contracts (collectively, derivatives)
whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates, and generally represent future commitments to exchange cash
flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future dates. A derivative contract may be traded on an exchange
or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and options on futures contracts. OTC derivative contracts are
negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts and certain options. Derivatives are subject to various
risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risks. 

Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of derivatives
due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity and security prices. Market
risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The market
risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according to each respective Program. The Master Fund is exposed
to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts
sold short. 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to
the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk due to exchange traded derivative financial
instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual exchanges on which the instruments are traded. At
any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized gain for each counterparty for which a netting
agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties. The credit risk exposure for
the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing interconnectivity
between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or financial market may
adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform due to inflation
(or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics,
terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions. The occurrence of global events similar to those in recent
years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, social and political discord or debt crises and downgrades, among
others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets. It is difficult
to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the
duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Master Fund.
The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive responses taken by many governments, including closing borders,
restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as well as the forced
or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and in many cases severe
negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant events described
above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits
with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker
to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s cash and other property
(for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker s
segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds
available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on
deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency, recovery of the Master Fund s assets on deposit
may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The notional value represents amounts related to the Master
Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies upon which the fair value of the futures contracts held
by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair value of, and are not necessarily indicative of the future
cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying price changes in relation to variables specified by the notional
values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments. Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is equal to the notional
value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold short. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had open futures contracts
with the following notional values by sector:

Note 5. Balance Sheet
Offsetting 

The Master Fund is required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets
and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or
potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognized assets and liabilities. These recognized assets and
liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement
or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria: each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts, the
Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to set off, and
the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The Master Fund is subject to enforceable master netting agreements
with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain transactions, and reduce the counterparty risk associated with
relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral posting arrangements at prearranged exposure levels. Since different
types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes traded out of different legal entities of a particular counterparty organization,
each type of transaction may be covered by a different master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the need for multiple agreements
with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements may not be specific to each different asset type; in such instances, they would
allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of default or early termination
with respect to any and all the transactions governed under a single agreement with the counterparty.

Note 6. Related
Parties 

As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had 76,418
receivable from the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition. Generally, receivables and payables from/to Feeder
Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity at the Feeder Fund level. 

Note 7. Financial
Highlights 

Financial highlights of the Master Fund for the year ended
December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived from information presented in the financial statements. 

Total return (A) 
 (80.84 
 
 Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment loss (C) 
 (0.45 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.79 

(A) Total return is based on the change in average member s equity
during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) The total expense and net investment loss ratios are computed
based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) The net investment loss ratio excludes net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial highlights are calculated for each member class
taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions. The negative total
return would have been lower and the net investment loss and total expense ratios would have been higher if the management, incentive
fees, and sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund. 

Note 8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events,
the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through
March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events
that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Opinion 

We
have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund Quest Master Fund (517) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement
of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations
and changes in member s equity for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In
our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of
December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section
of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities
of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management
is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

Our
objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate,
they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In
performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. 

Obtain
an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed. 

Evaluate
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude
whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We
are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit,
significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note
1. Organization and Structure 

Galaxy
Plus Fund Quest Master Fund (517) LLC (the Master Fund was formed in Delaware as a limited liability company on
January 12, 2016 and commenced operation on June 29, 2016. The Master Fund was created to serve as the trading entity managed by Quest
Partner, L.L.C. (the Trading Advisor pursuant to its Quest Tracker Index QTI (the Program ).
The Program is a systematic program that seeks to replicate the performance generated by the broad class of managed futures trading strategies
of trend following. 

The
Master Fund and other separately formed Delaware limited liability companies Other Master Funds ), are investment vehicles
available under the Galaxy Plus Managed Account Platform (the Platform ). The Master Fund and the Platform are sponsored
by New Hyde Park Alternative Funds, LLC (the Sponsor or NHPAF as a means of making available, to qualified
high net-worth individuals and institutional investors (including fund of hedge funds) Investors ), a variety of third-party
professional managed futures and foreign exchange advisors Advisors ). The Trading Advisor is not affiliated with the Sponsor. 

NHPAF
was formed in October 2013 and its principal office is located in Wheaton, Illinois. NHPAF is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, and is a member of the National Futures Association
(NFA). 

Galaxy
Plus Fund LLC, a Delaware Series Limited Liability Company (the Onshore Platform ), and Galaxy Plus Fund SPC, a Cayman Islands
Segregated Portfolio Company (the Offshore Platform serve as the feeder funds for the Platform and invest substantially
all of the assets of the respective segregated portfolios (each a Fund in the Master Fund or other Master Funds. Galaxy
Plus Fund Quest Feeder Fund (517) LLC517 ), a separated series of the Onshore Platform and Galaxy Plus Fund 
Quest Offshore Feeder Fund (517) Segregated Portfolio SPC517 ), a segregated portfolio of the Offshore Platform, can each
invest in the Master Fund. As of December 31, 2022, SPC517 had not yet commenced operations and LLC517 is the sole member. 

LLC517
and SPC517 are collectively hereafter referred to as the Feeder Funds . 

Subscriptions
and redemptions into the Feeder Funds and the corresponding transactions with the Master Fund are governed by the Onshore Platform s
and the Offshore Platform s respective Confidential Offering Memorandums. 

The
Platform has appointed the Sponsor, under the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the LLC Agreement as the
managing member of the Master Fund. In such capacity, the Sponsor has the authority, to manage, with wide discretionary powers, the business
and affairs of the Master Fund including the authority to select the administrator for the Master Fund. The LLC Agreement will continue
to remain in force until terminated by either the Sponsor or the Platform upon not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice.
In certain circumstances (for example, the insolvency of either party or in the event all trading for the Platform by the Advisors are
suspended), the LLC Agreement may be immediately terminated by either party. 

The
Master Fund and the Sponsor have entered into a tri-party contract (the Trading Agreement with the Trading Advisor pursuant
to which the Master Fund s trading accounts are managed, subject to rights of termination, by the Trading Advisor in accordance
with the Program. The Trading Advisor may alter its Program (including its trading systems and methods and including the addition and/or
deletion of any financial interests or contracts traded in the Master Fund s trading accounts), provided that the Trading Advisor
provide prior notice to the Master Fund and the Sponsor of any material change to the Trading Advisor s Program. From time to time,
the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) may manage additional accounts, and these accounts will increase the level of competition for
the same trades desired for the Master Fund, including the priorities of order entry. There is no specific limit as to the number of
accounts the Trading Advisors (or their affiliates) may manage. In addition, the positions of all of the accounts owned or controlled
by the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) are aggregated for the purposes of applying speculative position limits. The management, incentive,
and sponsor fees are paid directly by the Feeder Funds, and for this reason are not recorded as expenses of the Master Fund.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial
statements. 

Principles
of accounting: The accompanying financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent
reporting of financial condition and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting
guidance in FASB Account Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash
and restricted cash: Cash held in the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody
of the broker, a portion of which is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades.
The Master Fund may also hold cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at
the clearing broker, of which 2,203,167 is held in USD and a payable balance of (3,409) in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022,
and are recorded in cash and restricted cash margin balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies
fluctuate in value on a daily basis relative to the USD. A portion of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin
requirements. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included restricted cash for margin requirements of 1,206,540. This
cash becomes unrestricted when the underlying positions to which it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of
December 31, 2022 included amounts due to the broker for unsettled trades of 0. 

Offsetting
of amounts related to certain contracts: When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized
for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5). 

Valuation
and Revenue Recognition: Depending on the Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue
recognition policies. All investments are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures
and options on futures contracts: The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Master Fund agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price,
while an option contract provides the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial
instrument at a predetermined exercise price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade
date. The difference between the original contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference
between the premiums paid or received on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)
on open contracts. The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized
gain or loss is determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign
currency transactions: The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts,
non-U.S. futures contracts, and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities
and transactions denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business
on the last business day of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with
the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from
the sales of foreign currencies and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange
gain and loss arises from changes in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading
costs: Trading costs generally consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction
and NFA fees. Fees vary by type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures,
and forward contracts. Commissions are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses
for futures and options on futures transactions and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement
of Operations. 

Interest
income/expense: Interest income and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation
of income and gains and losses: Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions
and/or redemptions, are allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each
period throughout the year.

Galaxy Plus Fund Quest Master Fund (517) LLC 

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Income
taxes: The Master Fund will not be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master
Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained
by the applicable tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial
statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with the relevant taxing authority. The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax
positions taken or expected to be taken with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the
years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022, remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties. 

Use
of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications:
 The Sponsor and its affiliates are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The
Master Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide
for general indemnifications. The Master Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future
claims that may be made against the Master Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement
of Cash Flows: The Master Fund has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following
conditions have been met: 

During
the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements
in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The
Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The
Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions
and redemptions: Subscriptions and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week;
(or, if such day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master
Fund may accept subscriptions or redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested
subscription or redemption amount, with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note
3. Fair Value Measurements 

The
Master Fund s investments are stated at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC
820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value
hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by
level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 
Values for investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market.
Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does
not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 
Values for investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets
for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related
to restrictions on the investments. 

Level 3 
Values for investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant
to the fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

F- 159 

Galaxy Plus Fund Quest Master Fund (517) LLC 

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

A
description of the valuation methodologies applied to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price
information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of
the inputs for the Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022. The availability of observable inputs can vary between
investments and is affected by various factors such as type of investment and the volume and level of activity for that investment
or similar investments in the marketplace. 

Exchange-traded
derivative contracts that are actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative contracts can include futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values
are based on an underlying such as interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities.
Such derivative contracts are valued using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying
obtained from the applicable exchange or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and
are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual
date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding
the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the
year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative
financial instruments speculatively traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and
forward currency contracts (collectively, derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates,
and generally represent future commitments to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future
dates. A derivative contract may be traded on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and
options on futures contracts. OTC derivative contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts
and certain options. Derivatives are subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including
market and credit risks. 

Market
risk is the potential for changes in the value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements
and fluctuations in commodity and security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in
which the related underlying assets are traded. The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according
to each respective Program. The Master Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts
purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

Credit
risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit
risk due to exchange traded derivative financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual
exchanges on which the instruments are traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized
gain for each counterparty for which a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed
to counterparties. The credit risk exposure for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market
and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood
that events or conditions in one region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial
market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand
for particular products or resources, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental
actions. The occurrence of global events similar to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters,
social and political discord or debt crises and downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects
on both the U.S. and global financial markets. It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial
markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant
adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive
responses taken by many governments, including closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of
prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail
and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how
long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged
period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase
and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract
value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary
activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled
with all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery
may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash
and other property deposited.

Galaxy Plus Fund Quest Master Fund (517) LLC 

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

The
Master Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency,
recovery of the Master Fund s assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The
notional value represents amounts related to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies
upon which the fair value of the futures contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair
value of, and are not necessarily indicative of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying
price changes in relation to variables specified by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments.
Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold
short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The
Master Fund is required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition
to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position
for recognized assets and liabilities. These recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments
that are either subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria:
each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts
owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable at law. 

The
Master Fund is subject to enforceable master netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain
transactions, and reduce the counterparty risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral
posting arrangements at prearranged exposure levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes
traded out of different legal entities of a particular counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different
master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements
may not be specific to each different asset type; in such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total
exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed
under a single agreement with the counterparty.

6. Related Parties 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had 32,025 receivable from the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition.
Generally, receivables and payables from/to Feeder Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity
at the Feeder Fund level.

7. Financial Highlights 

Financial
highlights of the Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived
from information presented in the financial statements. 

Total return (A) 
 105.56 

Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment income (C) 
 0.73 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.16 

(A) Total return is based on the change in average member s equity
during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) The total expense and net investment income ratios are computed
based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) The net investment income ratio excludes net realized and
unrealized gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial
highlights are calculated for each member class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the
timing of capital transactions. The total return and the net investment income ratio would have been lower and total expense ratio would
have been higher if the management and incentive fees, as well as the sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the
Feeder Fund. 

Note
8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events,
the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through
March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events
that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Managing Member 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund 
LRR Master Fund (522) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments,
as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended, and the related
notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial statements. 

Principles of accounting: The accompanying
financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition
and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB Account
Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash and restricted cash: Cash held in
the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody of the broker, a portion of which
is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades. The Master Fund may also hold
cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at the clearing broker, of which
 488,560 is held in USD and 0 in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash and restricted cash margin
balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily basis relative to the USD. A portion
of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022
included restricted cash for margin requirements of 104,115. This cash becomes unrestricted when the underlying positions to which it
is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included amounts due to the broker for unsettled trades
of 0. 

Offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts: 
When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with
the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5).

Galaxy Plus Fund - LRR Master Fund (522) LLC 
 (A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation and Revenue Recognition: Depending
on the Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue recognition policies. All investments
are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures and options on futures contracts: 
The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Master Fund agrees
to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option contract provides
the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a predetermined exercise
price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference between the original
contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open
contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or received
on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts.
The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized gain or loss is
determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Trading costs: Trading costs generally
consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees. Fees vary by
type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward contracts. Commissions
are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures and options on futures transactions
and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income
and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: 
Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are
allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year. 

Income taxes : The Master Fund will not
be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions taken
or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken
with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022,
remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties. 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Indemnifications: The Sponsor and its affiliates
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The Master Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Master
Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Master
Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of Cash Flows: The Master Fund
has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and
classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions
and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or
redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount,
with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note 3. Fair Value Measurements 

The Master Fund s investments are stated
at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is
a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted
prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 Values for
investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market. Since valuations
are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does not entail a significant
degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Values for
investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets for which
all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related to restrictions
on the investments. 

Level 3 Values for
investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the
fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A description of the valuation methodologies applied
to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that
are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors.
These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022.
The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected by various factors such as type of investment and the
volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the marketplace.

 (A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Exchange-traded derivative contracts that are
actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts can include
futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values are based on an underlying such as
interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities. Such derivative contracts are valued
using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying obtained from the applicable exchange
or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and are categorized as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy. 

The Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments
at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that
caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels
of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments
are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments. 

The following tables present the classification

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative financial instruments speculatively
traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and forward currency contracts (collectively,
derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates, and generally represent future commitments
to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future dates. A derivative contract may be traded
on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and options on futures contracts. OTC derivative
contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts and certain options. Derivatives are subject
to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risks. 

Market risk is the potential for changes in the
value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity and security
prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.
The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according to each respective Program. The Master Fund
is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such
contracts sold short. 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may
occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk due to exchange traded derivative
financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual exchanges on which the instruments are
traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized gain for each counterparty for which
a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties. The credit risk exposure
for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing
interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or financial
market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform
due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters,
pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions. The occurrence of global events similar
to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, social and political discord or debt crises and
downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.
It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events
may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of
the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive responses taken by many governments, including
closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as
well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and
in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant
events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase and sale of futures contracts
requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The U.S. Commodity
Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A
customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with
all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency,
recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less
than total cash and other property deposited.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund has a substantial portion of its
assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency, recovery of the Master Fund s assets on
deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The notional value represents amounts related
to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies upon which the fair value of the futures
contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair value of, and are not necessarily indicative
of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures and options contracts. Further, the underlying price changes in relation to variables
specified by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments. Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure
is equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master
Fund had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

Note 5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The Master Fund is required to disclose the impact
of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognized assets and liabilities. These
recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable master
netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria: each of the two parties owes the other determinable
amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to
set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The Master Fund is subject to enforceable master
netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain transactions, and reduce the counterparty
risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral posting arrangements at prearranged exposure
levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes traded out of different legal entities of a particular
counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the
need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements may not be specific to each different asset type; in
such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of
default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed under a single agreement with the counterparty.

Note 6. Related Parties 

As of December 31, 2022 the Master Fund had 39,631
receivable from the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition. Generally, receivables and payables from/to Feeder
Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity at the Feeder Fund level. 

Note 7. Financial Highlights 

Financial highlights of the Master Fund for the
year ended December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived from information presented in the financial
statements. 

Total return (A) 
 71.43 

Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment loss (C) 
 (0.18 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.39 

(A) Total
return is based on the change in average member s equity during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master
Fund. 

(B) The
total expense and net investment loss ratios are computed based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December
31, 2022. 

(C) The
net investment loss ratio excludes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial highlights are calculated for each member
class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions. The total
return would have been lower and the net investment loss and total expense ratios would have been higher if the management, incentive
fees, and sponsor fee had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund. 

Note 8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events,
the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through
March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events
that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Managing Member 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

Opinion 

We
have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund QIM Master Fund (526) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement
of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations
and changes in member s equity for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. 

Obtain
an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed. 

Evaluate
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude
whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial
statements. 

Principles of accounting: The

Account Standards Codification Topic 946.

and Revenue Recognition: Depending on the Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the
following valuation and revenue recognition policies. All investments are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note
3. 

Futures
and options on futures contracts: The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures
contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Master Fund agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument
or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option contract provides the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a predetermined exercise price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures
contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference between the original contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts
purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected
in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or received on open options on futures contracts and fair value
of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts. The fair value of futures and options on futures
contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized gain or loss is determined on the settlement of intraday trades
first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign
currency transactions: The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However,
foreign currency forward contracts, non-U.S. futures contracts, and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies
other than USD. Assets and liabilities and transactions denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates
in effect either at the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively.
Such fluctuations are included with the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign
exchange gain or loss arises from the sales of foreign currencies and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement
dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange gain and loss arises from changes in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities
resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading costs: Trading
costs generally consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees.
Fees vary by type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward
contracts. Commissions are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures
and options on futures transactions and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest
income and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses:
 Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if
there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership
percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year. 

Income taxes:
 The Master Fund will not be subject to United States federal income
taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken to determine whether
the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not
threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. The Master Fund has determined that there is
no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken with respect to all open tax years. The
Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022, remain open. The Master Fund recognizes
interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the
year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties.

Notes to
Financial Statements 

Use of estimates: The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications: The
Sponsor and its affiliates are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The Master
Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general
indemnifications. The Master Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that
may be made against the Master Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of cash flows: The
Master Fund has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During
the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements
in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The
Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The
Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions
and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or
redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount,
with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note 3. Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Master Fund s investments are stated at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC
820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value
hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by
level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 
Values for investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market.
Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does
not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 
Values for investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets
for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related
to restrictions on the investments. 

Level 3 
Values for investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant
to the fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A
description of the valuation methodologies applied to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information,
credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the
Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022. The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected
by various factors such as type of investment and the volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the
marketplace.

Exchange-traded
derivative contracts that are actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative contracts can include futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values
are based on an underlying such as interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities.
Such derivative contracts are valued using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying
obtained from the applicable exchange or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and
are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual
date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding
the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the
year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative
financial instruments speculatively traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and
forward currency contracts (collectively, derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates,
and generally represent future commitments to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future
dates. A derivative contract may be traded on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and
options on futures contracts. OTC derivative contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts
and certain options. Derivatives are subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including
market and credit risks. 

Market
risk is the potential for changes in the value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements
and fluctuations in commodity and security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in
which the related underlying assets are traded. The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according
to each respective Program. The Master Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts
purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

Credit
risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit
risk due to exchange traded derivative financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual
exchanges on which the instruments are traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized
gain for each counterparty for which a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed
to counterparties. The credit risk exposure for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market
and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood
that events or conditions in one region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial
market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand
for particular products or resources, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental
actions. The occurrence of global events similar to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters,
social and political discord or debt crises and downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects
on both the U.S. and global financial markets. It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial
markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant
adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive
responses taken by many governments, including closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of
prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail
and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how
long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged
period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase
and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract
value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary
activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled
with all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery
may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash
and other property deposited.

The
Master Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency,
recovery of the Master Fund s assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The
notional value represents amounts related to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies
upon which the fair value of the futures contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair
value of, and are not necessarily indicative of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying
price changes in relation to variables specified by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments.
Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold
short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The
Master Fund is required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition
to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position
for recognized assets and liabilities. These recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments
that are either subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria:
each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts
owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The
Master Fund is subject to enforceable master netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain
transactions, and reduce the counterparty risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral
posting arrangements at prearranged exposure levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes
traded out of different legal entities of a particular counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different
master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements
may not be specific to each different asset type; in such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total
exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed
under a single agreement with the counterparty.

(A) 
 Total return is based on
the change in average member s equity during the period of theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) 
 The total expense and net
 investment income ratios are computed based on weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31,
 2022. 

(C) 
 The net investment income
ratio excludes realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial
highlights are calculated for each member class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the
timing of capital transactions. The total return and net investment income ratio would have been lower and total expense ratio would
have been higher if the management, incentive fees, and sponsor fee, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund.

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund 
Aspect Master Fund (532) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments,
as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended, and the related
notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. 

Obtain
an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed. 

Evaluate
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude
whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Aspect Offshore Feeder Fund (532) Segregated Portfolio SPC532 ), a segregated portfolio of the Offshore Platform, can each
invest in the Master Fund. As of December 31, 2022, SPC532 had not commenced operations and LLC532 is the sole member. 

LLC532

Notes to Financial Statements 

The
Master Fund and the Sponsor have entered into a tri-party contract (the Trading Agreement with the Trading Advisor pursuant
to which the Master Fund s trading accounts are managed, subject to rights of termination, by the Trading Advisor in accordance
with the Program. The Trading Advisor may alter its Program (including its trading systems and methods and including the addition and/or
deletion of any financial interests or contracts traded in the Master Fund s trading accounts), provided that the Trading Advisor
provide prior notice to the Master Fund and the Sponsor of any material change to the Trading Advisor s Program. From time to time,
the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) may manage additional accounts, and these accounts will increase the level of competition for
the same trades desired for the Master Fund, including the priorities of order entry. There is no specific limit as to the number of
accounts the Trading Advisors (or their affiliates) may manage. In addition, the positions of all of the accounts owned or controlled
by the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) are aggregated for the purposes of applying speculative position limits. The management, incentive,
and sponsor fees are paid directly by the Feeder Funds, and for this reason are not recorded as expenses of the Master Fund. 

Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial
statements. 

Principles
of accounting: The accompanying financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent
reporting of financial condition and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting
guidance in FASB Account Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash and restricted cash: Cash held in the commodity trading
accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody of the broker, a portion of which is required margin for
open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades. The Master Fund may also hold cash in a non-interest
bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at the clearing broker, of which 7,914,546 is held in
USD and a balance of 10,526 in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash and restricted cash margin
balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily basis relative to the USD. A portion
of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022
included restricted cash for margin requirements of 2,942,466. This cash becomes unrestricted when the underlying positions to which
it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included amounts due to the broker for unsettled
trades of 0. 

Offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts: 
When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with
the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5).

Galaxy Plus Fund Aspect Master Fund (532) LLC 

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation
and Revenue Recognition: Depending on the Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue
recognition policies. All investments are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures and options on futures
contracts: The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Master
Fund agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option
contract provides the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a
predetermined exercise price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference
between the original contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)
on open contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or
received on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on
open contracts. The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized
gain or loss is determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign currency transactions:
 The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts, non-U.S. futures contracts,
and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities and transactions denominated
in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business on the last business day
of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with the unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from the sales of foreign currencies
and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange gain and loss arises from changes
in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading costs: Trading costs generally consist
of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees. Fees vary by type of
contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward contracts. Commissions
are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures and options on futures transactions,
and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income and expense
is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: Profits
and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are allocated
pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year. 

Income taxes: The Master Fund
will not be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions
taken or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced
by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant
taxing authority. The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December
31, 2019, through 2022, remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits
as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications: The Sponsor and its affiliates
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for the Master Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Master
Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Master Fund.
However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of cash flows: The Master Fund has
elected not to provide a statement of cash flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year, substantially all of the Master
Fund s investments were carried at fair value and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The
Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions and
redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business day,
the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or redemptions
more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount, with the
approval of the Sponsor. 

Note 3. Fair Value Measurements 

The Master Fund s investments are stated at fair value
in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in
active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 Values for investments
classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market. Since valuations are based
on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does not entail a significant degree
of judgment. 

Level 2 Values for investments
classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets for which all significant
inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related to restrictions on the investments. 

Level 3 Values for investments
categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value and
unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A
description of the valuation methodologies applied to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information, credit data,
volatility statistics, and other factors. These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the Master Fund
were observable as of December 31, 2022. The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected by various
factors such as type of investment and the volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the marketplace. 

Exchange-traded derivative contracts that are actively
traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts can include futures
contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values are based on an underlying such as interest
rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities. Such derivative contracts are valued using
observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying obtained from the applicable exchange
or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and are categorized as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy. 

The Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments
at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that
caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the
fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments
are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative financial instruments speculatively traded
by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts (collectively, derivatives)
whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates, and generally represent future commitments to exchange cash
flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future dates. A derivative contract may be traded on an exchange
or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and options on futures contracts. OTC derivative contracts are
negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts and certain options. Derivatives are subject to various
risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risks. 

Market risk is the potential for changes in the value
of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity and security
prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.
The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according to each respective Program. The Master Fund
is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such
contracts sold short. 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur
due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk due to exchange traded derivative financial
instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual exchanges on which the instruments are traded. At
any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized gain for each counterparty for which a netting
agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties. The credit risk exposure for
the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing
interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or financial
market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform
due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters,
pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions. The occurrence of global events similar
to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, social and political discord or debt crises and
downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.
It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events
may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of
the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive responses taken by many governments, including
closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as
well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and
in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant
events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase and sale of futures contracts
requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange
Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s cash
and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds
subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share
of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited. 

The
Master Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency, recovery
of the Master Fund s assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The notional value represents amounts related to the
Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies upon which the fair value of the futures contracts
held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair value of, and are not necessarily indicative of the
future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying price changes in relation to variables specified by
the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments. Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is equal
to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had
open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The Master Fund is required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets
and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial condition to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or
potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognized assets and liabilities. These recognized assets and
liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement
or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria: each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts, the
Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to set off, and
the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The Master Fund is subject to enforceable
master netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain transactions, and reduce the counterparty
risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral posting arrangements at prearranged exposure
levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes traded out of different legal entities of a particular
counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the
need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements may not be specific to each different asset type; in
such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of
default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed under a single agreement with the counterparty.

arrangements:

Note
6. Related Parties 

As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had 69,749
receivable from the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition. Generally, receivables and payables from/to the
Feeder Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity at the Feeder Fund level. 

Note 7. Financial Highlights 

Financial highlights of the Master Fund for the
year ended December 31, 2022, are presented in the table below. The information has been derived from information presented in the financial
statements. 

Total return (A) 
 139.27 

Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment income (C) 
 1.19 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.23 

(A) 
 Total return is based on the change in average member s equity during the period of theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) 
 The total expense and net investment income ratios are computed based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) 
 The net investment income ratio excludes net realized
and unrealized gain on investments and foreign currency transactions. 

Financial highlights are calculated for each
member class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions. The total
return and net investment income would have been lower, and total expense ratios would have been higher if the management and incentive
fees, as well as the sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund. 

Note 8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Sponsor has
evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through March 30,
2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events that
would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Independent Auditor s Report 

Managing Member 

Galaxy Plus Fund LLC 

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund 
Welton GDP Master Fund (538) LLC (the Fund), which comprise the statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of
investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements of operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended,
and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in
member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to
meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate
whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial
Statements 

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood
that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on
a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered
in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time. 

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related
matters that we identified during the audit.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund and the Sponsor have entered into
a tri-party contract (the Trading Agreement with the Trading Advisor pursuant to which the Master Fund s trading
accounts are managed, subject to rights of termination, by the Trading Advisor in accordance with the Program. The Trading Advisor may
alter its Program (including its trading systems and methods and including the addition and/or deletion of any financial interests or
contracts traded in the Master Fund s trading accounts), provided that the Trading Advisor provide prior notice to the Master Fund
and the Sponsor of any material change to the Trading Advisor s Program. From time to time, the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates)
may manage additional accounts, and these accounts will increase the level of competition for the same trades desired for the Master Fund,
including the priorities of order entry. There is no specific limit as to the number of accounts the Trading Advisors (or their affiliates)
may manage. In addition, the positions of all of the accounts owned or controlled by the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) are aggregated
for the purposes of applying speculative position limits. The management, incentive, and sponsor fees are paid directly by the Feeder
Funds, and for this reason are not recorded as expenses of the Master Fund. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 

The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial statements. 

Principles of accounting: The accompanying
financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent reporting of financial condition
and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting guidance in FASB Account
Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash and restricted cash: Cash held in
the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody of the broker, a portion of which
is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades. The Master Fund may also hold
cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at the clearing broker, of which
 4,399,976 is held in USD and a payable balance of (1,185) in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash and
restricted cash margin balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily
basis relative to the USD. A portion of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the clearing
broker as of December 31, 2022, included restricted cash for margin requirements of 1,583,784. This cash becomes unrestricted when the
underlying positions to which it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included amounts
due to the broker for unsettled trades of 0. 

Offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts: 
When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with
the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5).

Galaxy Plus Fund Welton GDP Master Fund (538) LLC 

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation and Revenue Recognition: Depending
on the Program and Investments traded, The Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue recognition policies. All investments
are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures and options on futures contracts: 
The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures contract, The Master Fund agrees
to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price, while an option contract provides
the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial instrument at a predetermined exercise
price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade date. The difference between the original
contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open
contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference between the premiums paid or received
on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts.
The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized gain or loss is
determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign currency transactions: The
Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts, non-U.S. futures contracts,
and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities and transactions denominated
in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business on the last business day
of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with the unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from the sales of foreign currencies
and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange gain and loss arises from changes
in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading costs: Trading costs generally
consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction and NFA fees. Fees vary by
type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures, and forward contracts. Commissions
are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses for futures and options on futures transactions
and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement of Operations. 

Interest income/expense: Interest income
and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation of income and gains and losses: 
Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions and/or redemptions, are
allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each period throughout the year. 

Income taxes: The Master Fund will not
be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master Fund evaluates tax positions taken
or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.
For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced by the
largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken
with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2022,
remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Use of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications: The Sponsor and its affiliates
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The Master Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Master
Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Master
Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement of cash flows: The Master Fund
has elected not to provide a statement of cash flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following conditions have been met: 

During the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value and
classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s Equity. 

Subscriptions and redemptions: Subscriptions
and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week; (or, if such day is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master Fund may accept subscriptions or
redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested subscription or redemption amount,
with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note 3. Fair Value Measurements 

The Master Fund s investments are stated
at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is
a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted
prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 Values for
investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market. Since valuations
are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does not entail a significant
degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Values for
investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets for which
all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related to restrictions
on the investments. 

Level 3 Values for
investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the
fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values.

Notes to Financial Statements 

A description of the valuation methodologies applied
to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that
are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors.
These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022.
The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected by various factors such as type of investment and the
volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the marketplace. 

Exchange-traded derivative contracts that are
actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the
fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts can include
futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts, and option contracts whose values are based on an underlying such as
interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities. Such derivative contracts are valued
using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying obtained from the applicable exchange
or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and are categorized as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy. 

The Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments
at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that
caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels
of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments
are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative financial instruments speculatively
traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts, and forward currency contracts (collectively,
derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates, and generally represent future commitments
to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future dates. A derivative contract may be traded
on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and options on futures contracts. OTC derivative
contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts and certain options. Derivatives are subject
to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risks. 

Market risk is the potential for changes in the
value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity and security
prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded.
The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according to each respective Program. The Master Fund
is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such
contracts sold short. 

Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may
occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit risk due to exchange traded derivative
financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual exchanges on which the instruments are
traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized gain for each counterparty for which
a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed to counterparties. The credit risk exposure
for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing
interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood that events or conditions in one region or financial
market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform
due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, natural disasters,
pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental actions. The occurrence of global events similar
to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters, social and political discord or debt crises and
downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects on both the U.S. and global financial markets.
It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial markets may occur, the effects that such events
may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant adverse impact on the value and risk profile of
the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive responses taken by many governments, including
closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as
well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and
in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant
events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires
margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act
requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary activities. A customer s
cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds
subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro
rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The Master Fund has a substantial portion of its
assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency, recovery of The Master Fund s assets on
deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The notional value represents amounts related
to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies upon which the fair value of the futures
contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair value of, and are not necessarily indicative
of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures and forward contracts. Further, the underlying price changes in relation to variables
specified by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments. Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure
is equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold short. As of December 31, 2022, the Master
Fund had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

Notes to Financial Statements 

Note 5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The Master Fund is required to disclose the impact
of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition to enable users of the financial statements to
evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position for recognized assets and liabilities. These
recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable master
netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria: each of the two parties owes the other determinable
amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to
set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The Master Fund is subject to enforceable master
netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain transactions, and reduce the counterparty
risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral posting arrangements at prearranged exposure
levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes traded out of different legal entities of a particular
counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the
need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements may not be specific to each different asset type; in
such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of
default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed under a single agreement with the counterparty.

netting arrangements:

Note 6. Related Parties 

As of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had 379,088
receivable from the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition. Generally, receivables and payables from/to Feeder
Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity at the Feeder Fund level. 

Note 7. Financial Highlights 

Financial highlights of the Master Fund for the
year ended December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived from information presented in the financial
statements. 

Total return (A) 
 45.61 

Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment income (C) 
 0.14 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.07 

(A) Total return is based on the change in average member s equity
during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) The total expense and net investment income ratios are computed
based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) The net investment income ratio excludes net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial highlights are calculated for each member
class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of capital transactions. The total
return and net investment income ratio would have been lower and total expense ratio would have been higher if the management, incentive
fees, and sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund. 

Note 8. Subsequent Events 

In accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events,
the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through
March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance. The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events
that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s financial statements through this date.

Opinion 

We
have audited the financial statements of Galaxy Plus Fund Volt Diversified Alpha Master Fund (550) LLC (the Fund), which comprise
the statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2022, the related statements
of operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In
our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of
December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and changes in member s equity for the year then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section
of our report. We are required to be independent of the Fund and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion. 

Responsibilities
of Management for the Financial Statements 

Management
is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued or available to be issued. 

Auditor s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 

Our
objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate,
they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 

In
performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: 

Exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 

Identify
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. 

Obtain
an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed. 

Evaluate
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

Conclude
whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Fund s
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 

We
are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit,
significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The
Master Fund and the Sponsor have entered into a tri-party contract (the Trading Agreement with the Trading Advisor pursuant
to which the Master Fund s trading accounts are managed, subject to rights of termination, by the Trading Advisor in accordance
with the Program. The Trading Advisor may alter its Program (including its trading systems and methods and including the addition and/or
deletion of any financial interests or contracts traded in the Master Fund s trading accounts), provided that the Trading Advisor
provide prior notice to the Master Fund and the Sponsor of any material change to the Trading Advisor s Program. From time to time,
the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) may manage additional accounts, and these accounts will increase the level of competition for
the same trades desired for the Master Fund, including the priorities of order entry. There is no specific limit as to the number of
accounts the Trading Advisors (or their affiliates) may manage. In addition, the positions of all of the accounts owned or controlled
by the Trading Advisor (or its affiliates) are aggregated for the purposes of applying speculative position limits. The management, incentive,
and sponsor fees are paid directly by the Feeder Funds, and for this reason are not recorded as expenses of the Master Fund. 

Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed in the preparation of the Master Fund s financial
statements. 

Principles
of accounting: The accompanying financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (USD) and have been prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), to ensure consistent
reporting of financial condition and results of operations. The Master Fund is an investment company and follows the accounting and reporting
guidance in FASB Account Standards Codification Topic 946. 

Cash
and restricted cash: Cash held in the commodity trading accounts at clearing broker consists of either cash maintained in the custody
of the broker, a portion of which is required margin for open positions, or amounts due to/from the broker for margin or unsettled trades.
The Master Fund may also hold cash in a non-interest bearing USD commercial bank account. The Master Fund holds various currencies at
the clearing broker, of which 349,764 is held in USD and 0 in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded in cash
and restricted cash margin balance on the Statement of Financial Condition. The non-U.S. currencies fluctuate in value on a daily
basis relative to the USD. A portion of this cash is restricted cash required to meet maintenance margin requirements. Cash with the
clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included restricted cash for margin requirements of 92,906. This cash becomes unrestricted when
the underlying positions to which it is applicable are liquidated. Cash with the clearing broker as of December 31, 2022 included amounts
due to the broker for unsettled trades of 0. 

Offsetting
of amounts related to certain contracts: When the requirements are met, the Master Fund offsets certain fair value amounts recognized
for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement (see Note 5).

Notes to Financial Statements 

Valuation
and Revenue Recognition: Depending on the Program and Investments traded, the Master Fund follows the following valuation and revenue
recognition policies. All investments are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 

Futures
and options on futures contracts: The Master Fund may enter into futures and options on futures contracts. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Master Fund agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of an underlying instrument or commodity for an agreed-upon price,
while an option contract provides the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security or financial
instrument at a predetermined exercise price during a defined period. Futures and options on futures contracts are recorded on the trade
date. The difference between the original contract amount and the fair value of futures contracts purchased or sold is reflected as unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) on open contracts. Options on futures contracts are reflected in investments at fair value. The difference
between the premiums paid or received on open options on futures contracts and fair value of such options is recorded as unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)
on open contracts. The fair value of futures and options on futures contracts is based upon daily exchange settlement prices. The realized
gain or loss is determined on the settlement of intraday trades first and then by the FIFO method. 

Foreign
currency transactions: The Master Fund s financial statements are denominated in USD. However, foreign currency forward contracts,
non-U.S. futures contracts, and non-U.S. options on futures contracts are denominated in currencies other than USD. Assets and liabilities
and transactions denominated in currencies other than the USD are translated into USD at the rates in effect either at the close of business
on the last business day of the reporting period or on the date of such transactions, respectively. Such fluctuations are included with
the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open derivative contracts, net. Net realized foreign exchange gain or loss arises from
the sales of foreign currencies and currency gains or losses realized between trade and settlement dates. Net unrealized foreign exchange
gain and loss arises from changes in the fair value of margin collateral assets and liabilities resulting from changes in exchange rates. 

Trading
costs: Trading costs generally consist of brokerage commissions, brokerage fees, clearing fees, exchange and regulatory fees, transaction
and NFA fees. Fees vary by type of contract for each purchase and sale or sale and purchase (round turn) of futures, options on futures,
and forward contracts. Commissions are paid on each individual purchase and sale transaction. These costs are recognized as expenses
for futures and options on futures transactions, and are included in net realized gain/loss from derivative contracts on the Statement
of Operations. 

Interest
income/expense: Interest income and expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 

Allocation
of income and gains and losses: Profits and losses for each monthly accounting period, or shorter period if there are mid-month subscriptions
and/or redemptions, are allocated pro-rata to the Feeder Funds based on their respective ownership percentage on the first day of each
period throughout the year. 

Income
taxes: The Master Fund will not be subject to United States federal income taxation other than certain withholding taxes. The Master
Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained
by the applicable tax authority. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial
statements is reduced by the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with the relevant taxing authority. The Master Fund has determined that there is no tax liability resulting from uncertain income tax
positions taken or expected to be taken with respect to all open tax years. The Master Fund s U.S. Federal tax returns for the
years ended December 31, 2020 through 2022, remain open. The Master Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the year, the Master Fund did not accrue any interest or penalties.

Notes to Financial Statements 

Use
of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Indemnifications:
 The Sponsor and its affiliates are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties for The
Master Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Master Fund enters into contracts with vendors and others that provide
for general indemnifications. The Master Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future
claims that may be made against the Master Fund. However, the Master Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Statement
of Cash Flows: The Master Fund has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by GAAP as all of the following
conditions have been met: 

During
 the year, substantially all of the Master Fund s investments were carried at fair value
 and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820; 

The
 Master Fund had little or no debt during the year; 

The
 Master Fund s financial statements include a Statement of Changes in Member s
 Equity. 

Subscriptions
and redemptions: Subscriptions and redemptions can typically be made on a weekly basis as of the first day (Monday) of each week;
(or, if such day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) (each, a Subscription Date or a Redemption Date). The Master
Fund may accept subscriptions or redemptions more frequently than the first day of each week, depending upon the size of the requested
subscription or redemption amount, with the approval of the Sponsor. 

Note
3. Fair Value Measurements 

The
Master Fund s investments are stated at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC
820). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value
hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active market. Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by
level within that hierarchy, as follows: 

Level 1 
Values for investments classified as Level 1 are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in an active market.
Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily accessible at the measurement date, valuation of these investments does
not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 
Values for investments classified as Level 2 are based on quoted prices for similar investments in an active or non-active markets
for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may also include discounts related
to restrictions on the investments. 

Level 3 
Values for investments categorized as Level 3 are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant
to the fair value and unobservable, including valuations by the Sponsor in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values. 

A
description of the valuation methodologies applied to the Master Fund s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis follows. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an investment may include price information,
credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. These inputs can be either observable or unobservable. All of the inputs for the
Master Fund were observable as of December 31, 2022. The availability of observable inputs can vary between investments and is affected
by various factors such as type of investment and the volume and level of activity for that investment or similar investments in the
marketplace.

(A Delaware Limited Liability Company) 

Notes to Financial Statements 

Exchange-traded
derivative contracts that are actively traded are valued based on daily quoted settlement prices from the respective exchange and are
categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange-traded derivative contracts not actively traded and over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative contracts can include futures contracts, option on futures contracts, forward contracts and option contracts whose values
are based on an underlying such as interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equities or commodities.
Such derivative contracts are valued using observable market data, including currency spot rates or quoted prices of the related underlying
obtained from the applicable exchange or market. OTC derivative contracts are valued using the above described pricing methodology and
are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Master Fund assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual
date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Master Fund s accounting policy regarding
the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers among levels 1, 2, and 3 during the
year ended December 31, 2022. 

The
inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily indicative of the risk associated with investing in those instruments. 

The
following tables present the classification of derivatives, by type, into the fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2022. Presentation
is gross as an asset if in a gain position and a liability if in a loss position.

4. Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivative
financial instruments speculatively traded by the Master Fund can include U.S. and foreign futures, options on futures contracts and
forward currency contracts (collectively, derivatives) whose values are based upon an underlying asset, indices, or reference rates,
and generally represent future commitments to exchange cash flows, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified future
dates. A derivative contract may be traded on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and include futures and
options on futures contracts. OTC derivative contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include forward currency contracts
and certain options. Derivatives are subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including
market and credit risks. 

Market
risk is the potential for changes in the value of derivatives due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements
and fluctuations in commodity and security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in
which the related underlying assets are traded. The market risk of the Master Fund is managed by the underlying Trading Advisors according
to each respective Program. The Master Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of the derivatives contracts
purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 

Credit
risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. Credit
risk due to exchange traded derivative financial instruments is significantly reduced by the regulatory requirements of the individual
exchanges on which the instruments are traded. At any point in time, the credit risk for OTC derivatives is limited to the net unrealized
gain for each counterparty for which a netting agreement exists, if any. In a similar fashion, liabilities represent net amounts owed
to counterparties. The credit risk exposure for the Master Fund s outstanding OTC derivatives was 0 at December 31, 2022. 

Market
and geopolitical risk relate to the increasing interconnectivity between global economies and financial markets increases the likelihood
that events or conditions in one region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region, or financial
market. Securities in the Master Fund may underperform due to inflation (or expectations for inflation), interest rates, global demand
for particular products or resources, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, terrorism, regulatory events and governmental or quasi-governmental
actions. The occurrence of global events similar to those in recent years, such as terrorist attacks around the world, natural disasters,
social and political discord or debt crises and downgrades, among others, may result in market volatility and may have long term effects
on both the U.S. and global financial markets. It is difficult to predict when similar events affecting the U.S. or global financial
markets may occur, the effects that such events may have and the duration of those effects. Any such event(s) could have a significant
adverse impact on the value and risk profile of the Master Fund. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the aggressive
responses taken by many governments, including closing borders, restricting international and domestic travel, and the imposition of
prolonged quarantines or similar restrictions, as well as the forced or voluntary closure of, or operational changes to, many retail
and other businesses, has had negative impacts, and in many cases severe negative impacts, on markets worldwide. It is not known how
long such impacts, or any future impacts of other significant events described above, will or would last, but there could be a prolonged
period of global economic slowdown, which may impact your investment. 

Purchase
and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract
value. The U.S. Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker s proprietary
activities. A customer s cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled
with all other customer funds subject to the broker s segregation requirements. In the event of a broker s insolvency, recovery
may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash
and other property deposited.

Notes to Financial Statements 

The
Master Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with counterparties. In the event of a counterparty s insolvency,
recovery of the Master Fund s assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits. 

The
notional value represents amounts related to the Master Fund s stock exchange indices, commodities, interest rate and foreign currencies
upon which the fair value of the futures contracts held by the Master Fund are based. Notional values do not represent the current fair
value of, and are not necessarily indicative of the future cash flows of the Master Fund s futures contracts. Further, the underlying
price changes in relation to variables specified by the notional values affects the fair value of these derivative financial instruments.
Theoretically, the Master Fund s exposure is equal to the notional value of contracts purchased and unlimited on such contracts sold
short. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Master Fund had open futures contracts with the following notional values by sector:

5. Balance Sheet Offsetting 

The
Master Fund is required to disclose the impact of offsetting assets and liabilities presented in the Statement of Financial Condition
to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on its financial position
for recognized assets and liabilities. These recognized assets and liabilities include financial instruments and derivative instruments
that are either subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement or meet the following right of set-off criteria:
each of the two parties owes the other determinable amounts, the Master Fund has the right to set-off the amounts owed with the amounts
owed by the other party, the Master Fund intends to set off, and the Master Fund s right of set-off is enforceable by law. 

The
Master Fund is subject to enforceable master netting agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements govern the terms of certain
transactions, and reduce the counterparty risk associated with relevant transactions by specifying offsetting mechanisms and collateral
posting arrangements at prearranged exposure levels. Since different types of transactions have different mechanics and are sometimes
traded out of different legal entities of a particular counterparty organization, each type of transaction may be covered by a different
master netting arrangement, possibly resulting in the need for multiple agreements with a single counterparty. Master netting agreements
may not be specific to each different asset type; in such instances, they would allow the Master Fund to close out and net its total
exposure to a specified counterparty in the events of default or early termination with respect to any and all the transactions governed
under a single agreement with the counterparty.

6. Related Parties 

As
of December 31, 2022 the Master Fund had 74,789 payable to the Feeder Fund, as reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition. Generally,
receivables and payables from/to Feeder Fund are a result of timing differences of cash movements related to capital activity at the
Feeder Fund level. 

Note
7. Financial Highlights 

Financial
highlights of the Master Fund for the year ended December 31, 2022 are presented in the table below. The information has been derived
from information presented in the financial statements. 

Total return (A) 
 40.53 

Ratios to average member s equity (B): 

Net investment loss (C) 
 (0.56 
 
 Total expenses 
 0.71 

(A) Total return is based on the change in average member s equity
during the period of a theoretical investment made at the inception of the Master Fund. 

(B) The total expense and net investment loss ratios are computed
based upon weighted-average member s equity as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

(C) The net investment loss ratio excludes net realized and unrealized
gains (losses) on investments. 

Financial
highlights are calculated for each member class taken as a whole. An individual member s return and ratios may vary based on the
timing of capital transactions. The total return would have been lower, and the net investment loss and total expense ratios would have
been higher if the management, incentive fees, and sponsor fees, had been charged to the Master Fund instead of the Feeder Fund. 

Note
8. Subsequent Events 

In
accordance with FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Sponsor has evaluated all subsequent events requiring recognition and disclosure
in the Master Fund s financial statements through March 30, 2023, the date the financial statements were available for issuance.
The Sponsor has determined that there are no material events that would require recognition or disclosure in the Master Fund s
financial statements through this date.
