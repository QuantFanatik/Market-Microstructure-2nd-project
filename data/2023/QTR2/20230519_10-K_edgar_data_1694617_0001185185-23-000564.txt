ROYALE ENERGY, INC. 

PART I 

Item 1 Description of Business 

Royale Energy, Inc. Royale or the Company is an independent oil and natural gas producer incorporated under the laws of Delaware. Royale s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Royale was incorporated in Delaware in 2017 and is the successor by merger (as described below) to Royale Energy Funds, Inc., a California corporation formed in 1983. On December 31, 2022, Royale and its consolidated subsidiaries had 10 full time employees. 

Royale Business 

Royale and its subsidiaries own wells, leases, and proved and non-proved reserves of oil and gas located mainly in Mitchell County, Texas and in the Sacramento Basin and San Joaquin Basin in California, as well as in Utah, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado. Royale also owns an overriding royalty interest in a discovery in Alaska. Royale usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third-party participants and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account. Selling part of the working interest to others allows Royale to reduce its drilling risk by owning a diversified inventory of properties with less of its own funds invested in each drilling prospect, than if Royale owned all the working interest and paid all drilling and development costs of each prospect itself. Royale generally sells working interests in its prospects to accredited investors in exempt securities offerings. The prospects are typically bundled into multi-well investments, which permit the third-party investors to diversify their investments by investing in several wells at once instead of investing in single well prospects. 

During its fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Royale continued to explore and develop oil and natural gas properties with concentration in California and Texas. In 2022, Royale drilled and completed five wells and participated in the drilling of two wells, all of which were commercially productive. Royale s estimated total reserves were approximately 3.4 and 10.8 BCFE (billion cubic feet equivalent) at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. According to the reserve reports furnished by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc., Royale s independent petroleum engineers, the net reserve value of its proved developed and undeveloped reserves was approximately 23.3 million at December 31, 2022, based on the average Henry Hub natural gas price spot price of 6.357 per MCF and for oil volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate price of 94.14 per barrel as applied on a field-by-field basis. Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. supplied reserve value estimates for the Company s California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Utah properties. 

Net reserve value does not represent the fair market value of our reserves on that date, and we cannot be sure what return we will eventually receive on our reserves. Net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves was calculated by subtracting estimated future development costs, future production costs and other operating expenses from estimated net future cash flows from our developed and undeveloped reserves. 

Our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2022, was estimated to be 10,260,983. This figure was calculated by subtracting our estimated future income tax expense from the net reserve value of proved developed and undeveloped reserves, and by further applying a 10 annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows. A detailed calculation of our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow is contained in Note 19 to our Financial Statements, Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flow from Proved Reserve Quantities. 

Royale reported a gain on turnkey drilling in connection with the drilling of wells on a turnkey contract basis in the amount of 1,726,414 for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Royale reported a loss on turnkey drilling in the amount of 64,468. 

In addition to Royale s own staff, Royale hires independent contractors to drill, test, complete and equip the wells that it drills. Approximately 98.8 of Royale s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, came from sales of oil and natural gas from production of its wells in the amount of 2,611,222. In 2021, this amount was 1,686,424, which represented 98.1 of Royale s total revenues for the respective periods presented. See Note 3 to our Financial Statements.

Plan of Business 

Royale acquires interests in oil and natural gas reserves and sponsors private joint ventures. Royale believes that its stockholders are better served by diversification of its investments among individual drilling prospects. Through its sale of joint ventures, Royale can acquire interests and develop oil and natural gas properties with greater diversification of risk and still receive an interest in the revenues and reserves produced from these properties. By selling some of its working interest in most projects, Royale decreases the amount of its investment required in the projects and diversifies its oil and gas property holdings, to reduce the risk of concentrating a large amount of its capital in a few projects that may not be successful. 

After acquiring the leases or lease participation, Royale drills or participates in the drilling of development and exploratory oil and natural gas wells on its property. Royale pays its proportionate share of the actual cost of drilling, testing, and completing the project to the extent that it retains all or any portion of the working interest. 

Royale also may sell fractional working interests in undeveloped wells to finance part of the drilling cost. A drilling contract that calls for a company to drill a well, for a fixed price, to a specified depth or geological formation is called a turnkey contract. When Royale sells fractional working interests in undeveloped property to raise capital to drill oil and natural gas wells, generally it agrees to drill these wells on a turnkey contract basis, so that the holders of the fractional interests prepay a fixed amount for the drilling and completion of a specified number of wells. Under a turnkey contract, Royale may record a gain if total funds received to drill a well were more than the actual cost to drill those wells including costs incurred on behalf of the participants and costs incurred for its own account. 

Although Royale s operating agreements do not usually address whether investors have a right to participate in subsequent wells in the same area of interest as a proposed well, it is the Company s policy to offer to investors in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well. 

Our policy for turnkey drilling agreements is to recognize a gain on turnkey drilling programs after our obligations have been fulfilled, and a gain is only recorded when funds received from participants are in excess of all costs we incur during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account. See Note 1 to our Financial Statements, at page F-14. 

Once commenced, drilling is generally completed within 10-30 days. Royale maintains internal records of the expenditure of each investor s funds for drilling projects. 

Royale generally operates the wells it completes. As operator, we receive fees set by industry standards from the owners of fractional interests in the wells and from expense reimbursements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Royale charged overhead from operation of the wells in the amount of 355,681 for the year, which were an offset to general and administrative expenses. In 2021, the amount was 311,754. At December 31, 2022, Royale operated wells in California and Texas. Royale also has non-operating interests in wells in California, Utah, Texas, and Oklahoma. 

Royale currently sells most of its California natural gas production through Pacific Gas Electric PG E pipelines to independent customers on a monthly contract basis, while some gas is delivered through privately owned pipelines to independent customers. Since many users are willing to make such purchase arrangements, the loss of any one customer would not affect our overall sales operations. 

All oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets in which production naturally decreases over time as the finite amount of existing reserves are produced and sold. It is Royale s business as an oil and natural gas exploration and production company to continually search for new development properties. The Company s success will ultimately depend on its ability to continue locating and developing new oil and natural gas resources. Oil demand is subject to global demand and prices can fluctuate widely. In mid-2022, oil prices increased dramatically due to worldwide speculation caused by Russia s invasion of Ukraine, but by the end of 2022 had returned to pre-invasion levels. The future market is likely to be subject to continued similar price dynamics. Natural gas demand and the prices paid for gas are seasonal. In recent years, natural gas demand and prices in Northern California have fluctuated unpredictably throughout the year.

Competition, Markets and Regulation 

Competition 

The exploration and production of oil and natural gas is an intensely competitive industry. The sale of interests in oil and gas projects, like those Royale sells, is also very competitive. Royale encounters competition from other oil and natural gas producers, as well as from other entities that invest in oil and gas for their own account or for others, and many of these companies are substantially larger than Royale. 

Markets 

Market factors affect the quantities of oil and natural gas production and the price Royale can obtain for the production from its oil and natural gas properties. Such factors include: the extent of domestic production; the level of imports of foreign oil and natural gas; the general level of market demand on a regional, national and worldwide basis; domestic and foreign economic conditions that determine levels of industrial production; political events in foreign oil-producing regions; and variations in governmental regulations including environmental, energy conservation, and tax laws or the imposition of new regulatory requirements upon the oil and natural gas industry. 

Regulation 

Federal and state laws and regulations affect, to some degree, the production, transportation, and sale of oil and natural gas from Royale s operations. States in which Royale operates have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including provisions regarding deliverability. These statutes, along with the regulations interpreting the statutes, generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas, and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and natural gas by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit. On September 16, 2022, the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, signed Senate Bill No. 1137 SB1137 into law. SB1137 prohibits the issuance of well permits and the construction and operation of new production facilities within a health protection zone of 3,200 feet from certain sensitive (receptors such as homes, schools, nursing homes, or hospitals). We and our industry partner, RMX Resources, LLC RMX operate wells, production facilities, and future drilling located within a health protection zone. In December 2022, proponents of a voter referendum initiated to challenge SB1137 (the Referendum collected the requisite signatures to place SB1137 on the November 2024 ballot. On February 3, 2023, the Secretary of State of California certified that the requisite number of signatures had been submitted and validated for the Referendum to become duly qualified for the November 2024 ballot. By law, the effectiveness of a statute challenged in its entirety by a duly validated Referendum is stayed until it has been approved by the voters at the required election. Thus, the implementation of SB1137 s provisions are stayed as of February 3, 2023, until the Referendum challenge has been resolved by a vote of the California electorate on November 5, 2024. If SB 1137 were to be left in effect, it would limit certain undeveloped drilling locations, and significantly deter our participation in future drilling efforts with RMX. Additionally, we cannot predict any future actions the State of California, or other parties, may take that could further limit our ability to drill in certain areas. 

The exploration, development, production and processing of oil and natural gas are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations to protect the environment. Various federal and state agencies are considering, and some have adopted, other laws and regulations regarding environmental controls that could increase the cost of doing business. These laws and regulations may require: the acquisition of permits by operators before drilling commences; the prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas or where pollution arises; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly operations in offshore waters or on submerged lands. The cost of oil and natural gas development and production also may increase because of the cost of compliance with such legislation and regulations, together with any penalties resulting from failing to comply with the legislation and regulations. Ultimately, Royale may bear some of these costs. 

Presently, Royale does not hold any undeveloped federal acreage on which it had plans to drill, and does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or its competitive position in the oil and natural gas industry; however, changes in the laws, rules or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could have a materially adverse effect on Royale s financial condition or results of operation.

Royale also provides access to its SEC reports and other public announcements on its website, http://www.royl.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Royale is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 2 Description of Property 

Since 1993, Royale had concentrated on development of properties in the Sacramento Basin and the San Joaquin Basin of Northern and Central California. In the last few years it has moved its focus to the Los Angeles Basin in Southern California and to Mitchell County, Texas. In 2022, Royale drilled five developmental oil wells in Texas and participated in the drilling of two oil wells in southern California. 

Following industry standards, Royale generally acquires oil and natural gas acreage without warranty of title except as to claims made by, though, or under the transferor. In these cases, Royale attempts to conduct due diligence as to title before the acquisition, but it cannot assure that there will be no losses resulting from title defects or from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights. Title to property most often carries encumbrances, such as royalties, overriding royalties, carried and other similar interests, and contractual obligations, all of which are customary within the oil and natural gas industry. 

Following is a discussion of Royale s significant oil and natural gas properties. Reserves at December 31, 2022, for each property discussed below, have been determined by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc., registered professional petroleum engineers, in accordance with reports submitted to Royale on February 8, 2023. 

California 

Royale owns interests in nine gas fields with locations ranging throughout the Sacramento Basin in California. At December 31, 2022, Royale operated 12 wells and owns interests in 13 non-operated gas wells in Northern California and 8 non-operated oil wells in Southern and Central California. Our California estimated total proven, developed, and undeveloped net reserves are approximately 0.921 BCFE, according to Royale s independently prepared reserve report as of December 31, 2022. 

Texas 

At December 31, 2022, Royale owned and operated interests in 25 oil wells in its Jameson field. Our Texas estimated total proven, developed, and undeveloped net reserves are approximately 334.2 MBOE, according to Royale s independently prepared reserve report as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, Royale owns interests in four non-operated gas wells, two located in Oklahoma, one located in Texas and one located in Utah.

a) An exploratory well is one that is drilled in search of new oil and natural gas reservoirs, or to test the boundary limits of a previously discovered reservoir. A developmental well is one drilled on a previously known productive area of an oil and natural gas reservoir with the objective of completing that reservoir. 

b) Gross wells represent the number of actual wells in which Royale owns an interest. Royale s interest in these wells may range from 1 to 100 . 

c) A producing well is one that produces oil and/or natural gas that is being purchased on the market. 

d) A dry well is a well that is not deemed capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities. 

e) One net well is deemed to exist when the sum of fractional ownership working interests in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells expressed as a whole number or a fraction. 

Production 

The following table summarizes, for the years indicated, Royale s net share of oil and natural gas production, average sales price per barrel (BBL), per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of natural gas, and the MCF equivalent (MCFE) for the barrels of oil based on a 6 to 1 ratio of the price per barrel of oil to the price per MCF of natural gas. Net production is production that Royale owns either directly or indirectly through partnership or joint venture interests produced to its interest after deducting royalty, limited partner or other similar interests. Royale generally sells its oil and natural gas at prices then prevailing on the spot market and does not have any material long term contracts for the sale of natural gas at a fixed price.

Reserve Estimates 

Management has established, and is responsible for, internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of Proved Reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as established industry practices used by independent engineering firms and our peers. These internal controls include documented process workflows and qualified professional engineering and geological personnel with specific reservoir experience. Our internal processes and controls surrounding this process are routinely tested. We also retain outside independent engineering firms to prepare estimates of our Proved Reserves. Management reviews and approves our reserve estimates, whether prepared internally or by third parties. Our Chief Executive Officer oversaw our outside independent engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. ("NSAI"), in connection with the preparation of their estimates of our Proved Reserves as of December 31, 2022. We also regularly communicate with NSAI throughout the year regarding technical and operational matters critical to our reserve estimations. Our Chief Executive Officer, with input from other members of management, is responsible for the selection of our third-party engineering firms and review of the reports generated. Our Chief Executive Officer has over 38 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry and is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma with a degree in Chemical Engineering. During his career, he has had various relevant responsibilities in technical and leadership roles including asset management, drilling and completions, production engineering, reservoir engineering and reserves management, economic evaluations and field development in U.S. onshore projects. The third-party engineering reports are also provided to the Audit Committee.

As of December 31, 2022, Royale had proved developed reserves of 942,000 MCF and total proved reserves of 1,133,300 MCF of natural gas. For the same period, Royale also had proved developed oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 182,000 BBL and total proved oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 372,300 BBL. 

As of December 31, 2021, Royale had proved developed reserves of 939,100 MCF and total proved reserves of 1,354,300 MCF of natural gas. For the same period, Royale also had proved developed oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 193,600 BBL and total proved oil and natural gas liquid combined reserves of 1,579,100 BBL. 

During 2022, our overall proved developed and undeveloped oil reserves decreased by 76.4 and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.3 million barrels. This downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped oil reserves from drilling locations which the Company had previously estimated. Our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 16.3 and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 86 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. This downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped natural gas reserves from drilling locations which the Company had previously estimated. 

Oil and gas reserve estimates and the discounted present value estimates associated with the reserve estimates are based on numerous engineering, geological and operational assumptions that generally are derived from limited data.

Overview 

Royale is an independent oil and natural gas producer. Royale s principal lines of business are the production and sale of oil and natural gas, acquisition of oil and gas lease interests and proved reserves, drilling of both exploratory and development wells, and sales of fractional working interests in wells to be drilled by Royale. Since 1993, Royale has primarily acquired and developed producing and non-producing natural gas properties in California. In December 2018, Royale became the operator of a newly acquired field in Texas. The most significant factors affecting the results of operations are (i) changes in oil and natural gas prices, production levels and reserves, (ii) turnkey drilling activities, and (iii) the increase in future cost associated with abandonment of wells.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Revenue Recognition 

Royale s primary business is oil and gas production. Natural gas flows from the wells into gathering line systems, which are equipped occasionally with compressor systems, which in turn flow into metered transportation and customer pipelines. Monthly, price data and daily production are used to invoice customers for amounts due to Royale and other working interest owners. Royale operates most of its own wells and receives industry standard operator fees Supervisory Fees ). Supervisory Fees are recognized as a reduction to the Company s General and Administrative Expenses. 

Royale generally sells crude oil and natural gas under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. Revenues are recognized when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which the Royale has an interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of Royale s net working interest. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are not significant. 

The Company s Financial Statements include its pro rata ownership of wells. The Company usually sells a portion of the working interest in each well it drills or participates in to third-party participants and retains a portion of the prospect for its own account. All results, successful or not, are included at its pro rata ownership amounts: revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities as defined in FASB ASC 932-323-25 and 932-360. 

Equity Method Investments 

Investments in entities over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Income from equity method investments represents Royale s proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method. Equity method investments are included as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred and is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income. 

Oil and Gas Property and Equipment 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired. 

The project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. Interest costs, to the extent they are incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase, are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets. 

Royale uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this method, Royale accumulates its proportionate share of costs on a well-by-well basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred, and capitalizes expenditures for productive wells. Royale amortizes the costs of productive wells under the unit-of-production method. 

Royale carries, as an asset, exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and where Royale is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. 

Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves. 

12

Table of Contents 

Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. 

Production costs are expensed as incurred. Production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil and gas. The production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production storage tank. Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain Royale s wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. These costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related to the production activity. Proved oil and gas properties held and used by Royale are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 

Royale estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. Cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually updated evaluation assumptions for crude oil commodity prices. Annual volumes are based on field production profiles, which are also updated annually. Prices for natural gas and other products are based on assumptions developed annually for evaluation purposes. 

Impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves. An asset group would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair value. During 2022 and 2021, impairment losses of 0 and 177,011, respectively, were recorded on various capitalized lease and land costs where the carrying value exceeded the fair value or where the leases were no longer viable. 

Significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that Royale expects to hold the properties. The valuation allowances are reviewed at least annually. 

Upon the sale or retirement of a complete field of a proved property, Royale eliminates the cost from its books, and the resultant gain or loss is recorded to Royale s Statement of Operations. Upon the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property where the property has been assessed for impairment individually, a gain or loss is recognized in Royale s Statement of Operations. If a partial interest in an unproved property is sold, any funds received are accounted for as a recovery of the cost in the interest retained with any excess funds recognized as a gain. Should Royale s turnkey drilling agreements include unproved property, total drilling costs incurred to satisfy its obligations are recovered by the total funds received under the agreements. Any excess funds are recorded as a Gain on Turnkey Drilling Programs, and any costs not recovered are capitalized and accounted for under the successful efforts method. 

The Company sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations, and then reduced as costs to complete its obligations are incurred with any excess booked against its property account to reduce any basis in its own interest. Gains on Turnkey Drilling Programs represent funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs Royale incurs during the drilling programs (e.g., lease acquisition, exploration and development costs), including costs incurred on behalf of participants and costs incurred for its own account; and are recognized only upon making this determination after Royale s obligations have been fulfilled. 

The contracts require the participants to pay Royale the full contract price upon execution of the agreement. Royale completes the drilling activities typically between 10 and 30 days after drilling begins. The participant retains an undivided or proportional beneficial interest in the property, and is also responsible for their proportionate share of operating costs. Royale retains legal title to the lease. The participants purchase a working interest directly in the well bore. 

In these working interest arrangements, the participants are responsible for sharing in the risk of development, but also sharing in a proportional interest in rights to revenues and proportional liability for the cost of operations after drilling is completed. 

Since the participant s interest in the prospect is limited to the well, and not the lease, the participant does not have a legal right to participate in additional wells drilled within the same lease. However, it is the Company s policy to offer to participants in a successful well the right to participate in subsequent wells at the same percentage level as their working interest investment in the prior successful well with similar turnkey drilling agreement terms. 

13

Table of Contents 

A certain portion of the turnkey drilling participant s funds received are non-refundable. The Company records a liability for all funds invested as deferred drilling obligations until each individual well is complete. Occasionally, drilling is delayed for various reasons such as weather, permitting, drilling rig availability and/or contractual obligations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Royale had deferred drilling obligations of 8,129,965 and 7,824,939 respectively. 

If Royale is unable to drill the wells, and a suitable replacement well is not found, Royale would retain the non-refundable portion of the contract and return the remaining funds to the participant. Included in restricted cash are amounts for use in completion of turnkey drilling programs in progress. 

Losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is less than the carrying value. 

Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates pertain to proved oil, plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Deferred Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects, calculated at currently enacted rates, of (a) future deductible/taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns, and (b) operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. All available evidence, both positive and negative, must be considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed. The Company uses information about the Company s financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years. 

The Company must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome. 

Future realization of a tax benefit sometimes will be expected for a portion, but not all, of a deferred tax asset, and the dividing line between the two portions may be unclear. In those circumstances, application of judgment based on a careful assessment of all available evidence is required to determine the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more-likely-than-not a tax benefit will not be realized. 

Going Concern 

At December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 87,646,402, a working capital deficiency of 6,445,318 and a stockholders deficit of 33,136,603. As a result, our financial statements include a going concern qualification reflecting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to our audited financial statements. We do not possess funds necessary to implement our 2023 budget. Royale is continuing its drilling efforts with its direct working interest owners. In addition, we are exploring commitments to provide additional financing, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, needed to fully fund our 2023 drilling budget and to support future operations. 

Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022, as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of 145,594 compared to the net loss of 3,598,418 during the year in 2021. Total revenues from operations in 2022 were 2,642,537, an increase of 923,873 or 53.8 , from the total revenues of 1,718,664 in 2021, due to higher oil and natural gas commodity prices during 2022. Total expenses for operations in 2022 were 5,098,278, a decrease of 222,079 or 4.2 , from total expenses of 5,320,357 in 2021, mainly due to higher lease impairments and bad debt expenses during 2021.

Table of Contents 

During the year ended 2022, revenues from oil and gas production increased 924,798 or 54.8 to 2,611,222 from the 2021 revenues of 1,686,424. This increase was mainly due to higher commodity prices realized for the sale of oil and gas in 2022. The net sales volume of oil and condensate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 18,015 barrels of oil with an average price of 91.86 versus approximately 18,963 barrels with an average price of 65.28 per barrel, for the year in 2021. This represents a decrease in net sales volume of approximately 948 barrels or 5.0 , which was due to lower production volumes on existing wells due to natural declines and to the sale of certain non-operated wells during the period in 2021. The net sales volume of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately 135,136 Mcf with an average price of 7.01 per Mcf, versus 122,151 Mcf with an average price of 3.64 per Mcf for the year in 2021. This represents an increase in net sales volume of approximately 12,985 Mcf or 10.6 . The increase in natural gas production volume was due to certain non-operated wells that had previously been offline were brought back online at the end of 2021. 

Oil and natural gas lease operating expenses increased by 113,878 or 6.3 , to 1,928,521 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,814,643 for the year in 2021. This increase was mainly due to higher trucking and water disposal costs due to increases in manpower and fuel costs from outside vendors. When measuring lease operating costs on a production or lifting cost basis, in 2022, the 1,928,521 equates to a 7.93 per Mcfe lifting cost versus a 7.69 per Mcfe lifting cost in 2021, due to higher lease operating costs in 2022. 

The aggregate of Supervisory Fees and Other Revenue was 31,315 for year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 925 or 2.9 from 32,240 during the year in 2021. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased to 575,909 from 537,273, an increase of 38,636 or 7.2 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year in 2021. The depletion rate is calculated using production by comparing capitalized cost to the recoverable reserves remaining. This increase in depreciation expense was due to a decrease in expected recoverable reserves which increased the depletion rate. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 142,149 or 7.3 from 1,951,083 for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 1,808,197 for the year ended 2022. This decrease was due to lower employee related expenses and other administrative cost reduction measures during 2022. Legal and accounting expense increased to 526,550 for the year in 2022, compared to 419,587 for the year in 2021, a 106,963 or 25.5 increase. This increase was primarily due to higher outside accounting fees mainly related to conversion of our accounting software during 2022. Marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 28,755, or 12.5 , to 259,101, compared to 230,346 for the year in 2021. Marketing expense varies from period to period according to the number of marketing events attended by personnel and their associated costs. 

At December 31, 2022, Royale had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of 8,129,965. During 2022, we removed 7,027,474 of drilling obligations as we completed five oil wells in Texas and participated in completing the drilling of two oil wells in southern California, while incurring expenses of 5,301,060, resulting in a gain of 1,726,414. At December 31, 2021, Royale had a Deferred Drilling Obligation of 7,824,939. During 2021, we disposed of 1,841,061 of drilling obligations upon completing the drilling of two oil wells in Texas, while incurring expenses of 1,905,529, resulting in a loss of 64,468. 

During the year in 2022, we recorded a gain of 422,614 on settlement of accounts payable for a reduced amount. During 2022, we also recorded an Other Gain of 163,571, mainly due to the receipt of Employee Retention Credit (ERC) payroll tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service. During the year in 2021, we recorded a loss of 253,956 on sale of asset upon the sale of certain non-operated California properties which was completed during the third quarter of 2021. We also recorded a gain of 318,834 on the sale of asset upon the sale of certain non-operated Texas properties which was completed during the second quarter of 2021. In both sales, these non-operated properties were originally acquired during the 2018 merger with Matrix and booked as Held for Sale at the end of 2020, which resulted in a net gain on sale of assets of 64,878 in 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded a gain on settlement of 10,061 due to the payment by the Small Business Administration SBA of the remaining balance of our PPP loan obtained in 2020. During 2021, we recorded lease impairments of 177,011 on various lease and land costs in our California natural gas fields where the carrying value exceeded the fair value, no lease impairments were recorded in 2022. 

Bad debt expense for 2022 and 2021 were 0 and 190,414, respectively. Approximately 180,000 of the expenses in 2021 arose from identified uncollectable receivables relating to our oil and natural gas properties either plugged and abandoned or scheduled for plugging and abandonment P A and our year-end oil and natural gas reserve values. We periodically review our accounts receivable from working interest owners to determine whether collection of any of these charges appears doubtful. By contract, the Company may not collect some charges from its Direct Working Interest owners for certain wells that ceased production or had been sold during the year, to the extent that these charges exceed production revenue.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were 2,452 and 9,206, respectively. 

In 2022 and 2021, we did not have an income tax expense due to the use of a percentage depletion carryover valuation allowance created from the current and past operations resulting in an effective tax rate less than the new federal rate of 21 plus the relevant state rates (mostly California, 8.8 ). 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

At December 31, 2022, Royale had current assets totaling 8,814,790 and current liabilities totaling 15,260,108, a 6,445,318 working capital deficit. We had cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 of 1,650,507 and restricted cash of 2,249,627 compared to cash and cash equivalents of 220,304 and restricted cash of 4,002,500 at December 31, 2021. 

Ordinarily, we fund our operations and cash needs from our available credit and cash flows generated from operations. We believe there is some doubt that the Company has the ability to meet liquidity demands through cash-flow from operations. In that event, the Company will seek alternative capital sources through additional sales of equity or debt securities, or the sale of property, which may not be available at all, or on terms we deem reasonable. We have plans to increase oil and gas revenue in our Texas Jameson field through the workover of existing wells and drilling of new wells. During the fourth quarter 2022 and continuing into the first quarter of 2023, we have completed several successful workovers on existing wells in our Texas Jameson field. These workovers will lead to a significant increase in lease operating expenses but should eventually be offset by higher production volumes. We have commitments to continue to drill and workover wells in the Texas Jameson field and we have also made commitments to participate in the drilling and completion of several non-operated wells in the Permian Basin and in the redrill and completion of a Southern California well. 

At December 31, 2022, our other receivables net, which consist of joint interest billing receivables from direct working interest participants and industry partners, totaled 943,633, compared to 413,133 at December 31, 2021, a 530,500 increase. This increase was mainly due higher accounts receivables from direct working interest owners for lease operating expenses due to workovers and stimulation work in our Texas Jameson field during the 4 th quarter of 2022 in order to increase production. At December 31, 2022, revenue receivable was 701,937, an increase of 336,787, compared to 365,150 at December 31, 2021, due to higher commodity prices at year end 2022. At December 31, 2022, our accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled 5,528,829, an increase of 368,345 from the accounts payable at December 31, 2021 of 5,160,484, mainly due to drilling and lease operating costs at year end 2022. 

We have not engaged in hedging activities nor do we use derivative instruments to manage market risks. 

Operating Activities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash used in operating activities totaled 2,809,788 and 1,624,099, respectively. This 1,185,689 increase in cash used was primarily due to the increase in prepaid drilling costs during the period in 2022 due to participating in the drilling of four non-operated Texas oil wells at year end which are scheduled to be completed in 2023. 

Investing Activities . Net cash provided by investing activities totaled 2,608,871 and 3,465,024 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Changes in Reserve Estimates 

During 2022, our overall proved developed and undeveloped oil reserves decreased by 76.4 and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.3 million barrels. This downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped oil reserves from drilling locations which the Company had previously estimated. Our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 16.3 and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 86 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. This downward revision was mainly the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped natural gas reserves from drilling locations which the Company had previously estimated. See Note 19 - Supplemental Information about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited), to our Financial Statements. 

During 2021, our overall proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserves decreased by 49.1 and our previously estimated proved developed and undeveloped natural gas reserve quantities were revised downward by approximately 1.9 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Item 9A Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that information required to be publicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the material weakness that is described below. 

Material Weakness and Remediation 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

17

Table of Contents 

In connection with the audit of our 2019 consolidated financial statements, management identified a material weakness that existed because we did not maintain effective controls over our financial close and reporting process, and concluded that the financial close and reporting process needed additional formal procedures to ensure there are appropriate reviews over all financial reporting analysis. Management has also identified a material weakness that existed due to the lack of segregation of duties and controls, including user access, regarding our financial reporting system. Updated procedures have been implemented through the close process for the year ended December 31, 2022, but the material weakness on our financial close and reporting process was not alleviated. We will continue to monitor these throughout 2023 to be able to fully assess whether the procedures and controls are effective. 

Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than the remedial activities described above, no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Compensation Committee Report 

Our executive compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on its discussion and review, has recommended that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this annual report. 

Members of the Compensation Committee: 

Chris Parada, John Sullivan (Chair), and Jeff Kerns 

All members of the compensation committee are independent members of the Board of Directors. 

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

Our executive compensation policy is designed to motivate, reward and retain the key executive talent necessary to achieve our business objectives and contribute to our long-term success. Our compensation policy for our executive officers focuses primarily on determining appropriate salary levels and performance-based cash bonuses. 

The elements of executive compensation at Royale consist mainly of cash salary and, if appropriate, a cash bonus at yearend. The compensation committee makes recommendations to the board of directors annually on the compensation of the three top executives: Johnny Jordan, Chief Executive Officer, Donald H. Hosmer, Business Development, and Ronald Lipnick, Interim Chief Financial Officer . 

22

Table of Contents 

Royale also does not provide extensive personal benefits to its executives beyond those benefits, such as health insurance, that are provided to all employees. Donald Hosmer receives an annual car allowance. 

Policy 

The compensation committee s primary responsibility is making recommendations to the board of directors relating to compensation of our officers. The committee also makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding employee benefits, our defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and stock-based plans. 

Determination 

To determine executive compensation, the committee, from time-to-time, meets with our officers to review our compensation programs, discuss the performance of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of each of the officers pay levels and business results compared to others similarly situated within the industry. The committee then makes recommendations to the board of directors for any adjustment to the officers compensation levels. The committee does not employ compensation consultants to make recommendations on executive compensation. 

Compensation Elements 

Base. Base salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account competitive market compensation paid by our peers. Base salaries are reviewed annually. The salaries we paid to our most highly paid executive officers and next most highly compensated non-executive officer for the last three years are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table included under Executive Compensation . 

Bonus . The compensation committee meets annually to determine the quantity, if any, of the cash bonuses of executive officers. The amount granted is based, subjectively, upon the Company s stock price performance, earnings, revenue, reserves and production. The committee does not use quantifiable metrics for these criteria; but rather uses each in balance to assess the strength of the Company s performance. The committee believes that formulaic approaches to cash incentives can foster an unhealthy balance between short-term and long-term goals. No cash bonuses were paid to executive officers in 2021 or 2020, other than those listed for Donald Hosmer in the table above. 

Pay Versus Performance 

As required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid CAP and certain financial performance of our company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Royale Energy, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Royale Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and its total liabilities exceed its total assets. This raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters also are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Estimation of Proved Reserves of Oil and Gas Properties 

Critical Accounting Matter Description 

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company accounts for its oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method of accounting which requires management to make estimates of proved reserve volumes and future revenues and expenses to calculate depletion expense and measure its oil and gas properties for potential impairment. To estimate the volume of proved reserves and future revenues, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasting the production decline rate of producing properties and the timing and volume of production associated with the Company's development plan for proved undeveloped properties. In addition, the estimation of proved reserves is also impacted by management's judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with proved reserves to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required in the estimation of depletion expense and potential impairment measurements. We identified the estimation of proved reserves of oil and gas properties, due to its impact on depletion expense and impairment evaluation, as a critical audit matter. 

The principal consideration for our determination that the estimation of proved reserves is a critical audit matter is that changes in certain inputs and assumptions necessary to estimate the volumes and future net revenues of the Company s proved reserves require a high degree of subjectivity and could have a significant impact on the measurement of depletion expense or the impairment assessment. In turn, auditing those inputs and assumptions required subjective and complex auditor judgement. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management's controls related to the estimation of proved reserves by evaluating the level of knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company's reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company, made inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the Company's proved reserve volumes, and read the reserve report prepared by the Company's specialists. 

To the extent key, sensitive inputs and assumptions used to determine proved reserve volumes and other cash flow inputs and assumptions are derived from the Company's accounting records, such as commodity pricing, historical pricing differentials, operating costs, estimated capital costs and working and net revenue interests, we evaluated management's process for determining the assumptions, including examining the underlying support, on a sample basis. These audit procedures, among others included the following: 

Compared the estimated pricing differentials used in the reserve report to realized prices related to revenue transactions recorded in the current year and examined contractual support for the pricing differentials; 

F-3

Table of Contents 

Evaluated the models used to estimate the operating costs at year-end compared to historical operating costs; 

Compared the models used to determine the future capital expenditures and compared estimated future capital expenditures used in the reserve report to amounts expended for recently drilled and completed wells with similar locations; 

Evaluated the working and net revenue interests used in the reserve report by inspecting a sample of ownership interest, historical pricing differentials and operating costs to underlying support from the Company's accounting records; 

Evaluated the Company's evidence supporting the amount of proved undeveloped properties reflected in the reserve report by examining support for the Company's or the operator's ability and intent to develop the proved undeveloped properties; and 

Applied analytical procedures to the reserve report by comparing to historical actual results and to the prior year reserve report. 

Deferred Drilling Obligation Gain or Loss on Turnkey Drilling 

Critical Accounting Matter Description 

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company sponsors turnkey drilling arrangements in proved and unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as deferred drilling obligations. That obligation is reduced as costs to complete are incurred, with any excess costs booked as an increase to the Company's property account. Gain on turnkey drilling represents funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs the Company incurs during the drilling programs and is recognized only upon making the determination that the Company's obligations have been fulfilled in accordance with the turnkey drilling agreement. The Company's deferred drilling obligation was approximately 8.1 million as of December 31, 2022, and the gain on turnkey drilling was 1,726,414 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Company management applies significant estimation in determining the expected cost to drill a well and to develop the well site, and significant judgment in determining when they have fulfilled their obligations under the turnkey drilling agreement triggering the recognition of turnkey gain. Both factors may impact the amount and timing of the recognition of a turnkey gain and involve a high degree of auditor judgement related to the matter. These factors were the principal considerations that led us to determine that the deferred drilling obligation and the related gain on turnkey drilling arrangements is a critical audit matter. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management's controls related to the estimations in determining the expected cost to drill a well, develop the well site, and when obligations under the turnkey drilling agreements have been fulfilled. Other audit procedures involved selecting a sample of wells to test management's estimates as follows: 

Obtained the master worksheet for each selected well, recalculated the worksheet for clerical accuracy and selected a sample of direct working interest ("DWI") investors; 

Obtained the signed field subscription agreement for each selected investor in each well, verified the investment ownership amount per the signed field subscription agreement agreed to the amount invested and the number of units within the master worksheet, vouched the cash received from the DWI investors and agreed the significant terms to the related turnkey drilling agreement; 

Obtained a schedule of costs incurred to drill the selected well, recalculated the schedule for clerical accuracy and obtained support from management to substantiate the costs incurred; and 

Obtained evidence substantiating the timing and amount of the turnkey gain pertaining to a sample of wells drilled and assessed that the recognized turnkey gain was appropriate as defined under the terms of the related turnkey drilling agreement.

Deferred Drilling Obligation Gain/Loss on Turnkey Drilling 

Critical Accounting Matter Description 

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company sponsors turnkey drilling agreement arrangements in proved and unproved properties as a pooling of assets in a joint undertaking, whereby proceeds from participants are reported as Deferred Drilling Obligations. That obligation is reduced as costs to complete are incurred, with any excess cost incurred booked against the Company s property account to reduce any basis in its own interest. Gain on Turnkey Drilling represents funds received from turnkey drilling participants in excess of all costs the Company incurs during the drilling programs and is recognized only upon making the determination that the Company s obligations have been fulfilled. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s Deferred Drilling Obligation was approximately 7.8 million, and the Loss on Turnkey Drilling was 64,468.

Company management applies significant estimation in determining the expected cost to drill a well and to develop the well site, and significant judgment in determining when they have fulfilled their obligations under the Private Placement Memorandums triggering the recognition of turnkey gain. Both factors may impact the amount and timing of the recognition of a turnkey gain and involve a high degree of auditor judgement related to the matter. These factors were the principal considerations that led us to determine that Deferred Drilling Obligation and Gain on Turnkey Drilling is a critical audit matter. 

We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of management s controls related to the estimations in determining the expected cost to drill a well, develop the well site, and when obligations under the Private Placement Memorandums have been fulfilled. Other audit procedures involved selecting a sample of wells to test management s estimates as follows: 

Obtained the master spreadsheet for each selected well, recalculated the worksheet for clerical accuracy, and sampled the direct working interest (DWI) investors; 

Obtained the signed field subscription agreement for each selected investor in each well, verified the investment ownership amount per the signed field subscription agreement agreed to the amount invested and the number of units within the master spreadsheet, vouched the cash received from the DWI investors, and agreed the significant terms to the related Private Placement Memorandum; 

Obtained a schedule of costs incurred to drill the selected well, recalculated the schedule for clerical accuracy, and obtained support from management to substantiate the costs incurred; and 

Obtained evidence substantiating the timing and amount of the turnkey gain recognized for a sample of wells drilled and assessed that the recognized turnkey gain was appropriate as defined under the terms of the Private Placement Memorandums.

Mr. Johnny Jordan 

 Royale Energy, Inc. 

 1530 Hilton Head Road, Suite 205 

 El Cajon, California 92019 

Dear Mr. Jordan: 

In accordance with your request, we have estimated the proved reserves and future revenue, as of December 31, 2022, to the Royale Energy, Inc. (Royale) interest in certain oil and gas properties located in California, Oklahoma, and Texas. We completed our evaluation on or about February 8, 2023. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimated in this report constitute all of the proved reserves owned by Royale. The estimates in this report have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, except that future income taxes are excluded and, as requested, abandonment costs have only been included in our estimates of future net revenue for proved undeveloped properties located in California and Texas. Definitions are presented immediately following this letter. This report has been prepared for Royale's use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 

We estimate the net reserves and future net revenue to the Royale interest in these properties, as of December 31, 2022, to be:

The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBBL); a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. Gas volumes are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. 

Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty; reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. No study was made to determine whether probable or possible reserves might be established for these properties. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. This report does not include any value that could be attributed to interests in undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. 

Gross revenue is Royale's share of the gross (100 percent) revenue from the properties prior to any deductions. Future net revenue is after deductions for Royale's share of production taxes, ad valorem taxes, capital costs, abandonment costs, and operating expenses but before consideration of any income taxes. The future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent to determine its present worth, which is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of money. Future net revenue presented in this report, whether discounted or undiscounted, should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. 

Prices used in this report are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December 2022. For oil volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate spot price of 94.14 per barrel is adjusted by field for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of 6.357 per MMBTU is adjusted by field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 89.29 per barrel of oil and 4.876 per MCF of gas. 

For the Sansinena Field properties, operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of RMX Resources, LLC (RMX), the operator of the properties. For all other properties, operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of Royale and our knowledge of similar operations in the area. Operating costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the district and field levels. Operating costs have been divided into per-well costs and per-unit-of-production costs. Headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of Royale are included to the extent that they are covered under joint operating agreements for the operated properties. Operating costs are not escalated for inflation. 

Capital costs used in this report were provided by Royale and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment. Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review of the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs used in this report for proved undeveloped properties located in North Jameson and Permian Fields are Royale's estimates of the costs to abandon the wells and production facilities, net of any salvage value. As requested, our estimates for all other properties do not include any salvage value for the lease and well equipment or the cost of abandoning the properties. Capital costs and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation. 

For the purposes of this report, we did not perform any field inspection of the properties, nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and facilities. We have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties; therefore, our estimates do not include any costs due to such possible liability. 

We have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the Royale interest. Therefore, our estimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances; our projections are based on Royale receiving its net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production. Additionally, we have made no specific investigation of any firm transportation contracts that may be in place for these properties; our estimates of future revenue include the effects of such contracts only to the extent that the associated fees are accounted for in the historical field- and lease-level accounting statements. 

The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible; probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, our estimates are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Royale, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that our projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing this report. 

For the purposes of this report, we used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using deterministic methods; these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis, and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. A substantial portion of these reserves are for behind-pipe zones and undeveloped locations; such reserves are based on estimates of reservoir volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. 

The data used in our estimates were obtained from Royale, RMX, public data sources, and the nonconfidential files of Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. (NSAI) and were accepted as accurate. Supporting work data are on file in our office. We have not examined the titles to the properties or independently confirmed the actual degree or type of interest owned. The technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. C. Ashley Smith, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2006 and has over 5 years of prior industry experience. Edward C. Roy III, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 2008 and has over 11 years of prior industry experience. We are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; we do not own an interest in these properties nor are we employed on a contingent basis.

The following definitions are set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Section 210.4 10(a). Also included is supplemental information from (1) the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, (2) the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, and (3) the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. 

(1) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. 

(2) Analogous reservoir . Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an "analogous reservoir" refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: 

(i) Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); 

 (ii) Same environment of deposition; 

 (iii) Similar geological structure; and 

 (iv) Same drive mechanism. 

Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) : Reservoir properties must, in the aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest. 

(3) Bitumen . Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. 

(4) Condensate . Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. 

(5) Deterministic estimate . The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 

(6) Developed oil and gas reserves . Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: 

(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and 

 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

Supplemental definitions from the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System: 

Developed Producing Reserves Expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved recovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 

Developed Non-Producing Reserves Shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

(7) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to: 

(i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves. 

 (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. 

 (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems. 

 (iv) Provide improved recovery systems. 

(8) Development project . A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. 

(9) Development well . A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 

(10) Economically producible . The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. 

(11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) . Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date. 

(12) Exploration costs . Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are: 

(i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or "G G" costs. 

 (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records. 

 (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions. 

 (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells. 

 (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. 

(13) Exploratory well . An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. 

(14) Extension well . An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. 

(15) Field . An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms "structural feature" and "stratigraphic condition" are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. 

(16) Oil and gas producing activities . 

(i) Oil and gas producing activities include: 

(A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas ("oil and gas") in their natural states and original locations; 

 (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties; 

 (C) The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as: 

 (1) Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and 

 (2) Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and 

 (D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction. 

Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i) : The oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a "terminal point", which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. If unusual physical or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as: 

a. The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal; and 

 b. In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading, the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas. 

Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): For purposes of this paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered. 

(ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include: 

(A) Transporting, refining, or marketing oil and gas; 

 (B) Processing of produced oil, gas, or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production; 

 (C) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil, gas, or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted; or 

 (D) Production of geothermal steam. 

(17) Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 

(i) When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. 

 (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. 

 (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. 

 (iv) The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects. 

 (v) Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 

 (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations. 

(18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

(i) When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. 

 (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 

 (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. 

 (iv) See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section. 

(19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. 

(20) Production costs . 

(i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are: 

(A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (B) Repairs and maintenance. 

 (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. 

 (E) Severance taxes. 

(ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. 

(21) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. 

(22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: 

(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 

(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 

(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 

 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

(23) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves. 

(24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. 

(25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

(26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

Note to paragraph (a)(26) : Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

Excerpted from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas: 

932-235-50-30 A standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to an entity's interests in both of the following shall be disclosed as of the end of the year: 

a. Proved oil and gas reserves (see paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B) 

 b. Oil and gas subject to purchase under long-term supply, purchase, or similar agreements and contracts in which the entity participates in the operation of the properties on which the oil or gas is located or otherwise serves as the producer of those reserves (see paragraph 932-235-50-7). 

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to those two types of interests in reserves may be combined for reporting purposes. 

932-235-50-31 All of the following information shall be disclosed in the aggregate and for each geographic area for which reserve quantities are disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B: 

a. Future cash inflows. These shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entity's proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. 

 b. Future development and production costs. These costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. If estimated development expenditures are significant, they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs. 

 c. Future income tax expenses. These expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax expenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves. 

d. Future net cash flows. These amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows. 

 e. Discount. This amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. 

 f. Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount. 

(27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

(28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. 

(29) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion. 

(30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as "exploratory type" if not drilled in a known area or "development type" if drilled in a known area. 

(31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 

 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 

From the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (October 26, 2009): 

Although several types of projects such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas, remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods, this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances. No particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period, and any extension beyond five years should be the exception, and not the rule. 

Factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include, but are not limited to, the following: 

The company's level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed (for example, drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities); 

 The company's historical record at completing development of comparable long-term projects; 

 The amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases, or booked the reserves, without significant development activities; 

 The extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan (for example, if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans, recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate); and 

 The extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment (for example, restrictions on development on Federal lands, but not obtaining government permits), rather than by internal factors (for example, shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority). 

(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

(32) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
