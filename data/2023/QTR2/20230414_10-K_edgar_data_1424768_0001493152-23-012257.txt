This
Form 10-K contains some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events.
You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales,
profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategies, (c) anticipated trends in our industries, (d) our future financing plans and
(e) our anticipated needs for working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words may, will, 
 should, anticipate, estimate, plans, potential, projects, 
 continuing, ongoing, expects, management believes, we believe, 
 we intend or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These statements
may be found under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Business, 
as well as in this Form 10-K generally. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product
approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such
as legal proceedings, and financial results. 

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this report may turn out to be inaccurate. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions
we might make or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future
results may vary materially as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under Risk Factors 
and matters described in this Form 10-K generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking
statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 

The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future
events, or otherwise. 

ITEM
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

1.
Organizational History 

The
Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as Vycor Medical LLC .
On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Vycor Medical, Inc. Vycor ).
The Company s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially
all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. NovaVision and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary,
completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited Sight Science ), a previous competitor to NovaVision. 

2.
Overview of Business 

Vycor
is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct
business units within the medical device industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery.
NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage
such as that caused by a stroke. Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. The Company has 61 issued or allowed patents
and a further 11 pending. The Company leverages joint resources across the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner. 

3 

The
Company periodically engages in discussions with potential strategic partners for or purchasers of each or both of our operating divisions.
In April 2020, the board of Vycor took the decision to close the German operations of NovaVision, including the German office and NovaVision
GmbH, and instead migrate to a licensed business model, entering into a license agreement with HelferApp GmbH, a cognitive therapy specialist.
Under the agreement, HelferApp is licensed to provide NovaVision s products and therapies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to
patients and professionals. The NovaVision German office was closed effective June 30, 2020. 

Vycor
Medical 

Vycor
Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical s ViewSite Brain Access System VBAS is a next generation retraction and access system. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2016 and MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) certified,
and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, and regulatory approvals
in a number of other international markets. Vycor Medical has 30 granted and 11 pending patents. 

NovaVision 

NovaVision
provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation therapies targeted at people who have impaired vision as a result of stroke or other
brain injury and has 31 granted patents. 

Strategy 

The
Company is continuing to execute on a plan to achieve revenue growth and a reduction in annual cash operating losses 1 . For
Vycor Medical this plan includes: increasing market penetration in the US; increasing international growth in territories where we are
not represented or under-represented and continued new product development in response to market demands and demonstrating applicability
in a broader range of pathologies. In the US the Company is focused on increasing market penetration through targeting neurosurgeons
systematically, both through its distribution network and also directly by leveraging existing key opinion leader KOL neurosurgeon VBAS supporters to access
new neurosurgeon users. 

The
Company continues to target key international territories including Europe where it intends to drive adoption of its VBAS product through
selected key KOL neurosurgeon VBAS users in each territory to identify both new potential users and also high-quality distribution partners
to bolster our existing network. 

The
Company has for some time been working to better integrate its VBAS with neuronavigation. The first phase of the modification of the
existing VBAS product range was completed in September 2017 and was well received by surgeons. The second phase involves the introduction
of an optional Alignment Clip accessory that snaps onto the VBAS and allows for a neuronavigation pointer to be fully integrated into
the body of the VBAS; this new model range, known as the VBAS AC, was launched in September 2022. The Company will continue to work with
neuronavigation companies to seek ways to further integrate the VBAS with neuronavigation and with other companies with complementary
technologies used in neurosurgery. We will also be exploring with neurosurgeons and focus groups additional selected development work
targeted at increasing the ease and applicability of our products to additional common procedures. 

For
NovaVision, given the company s resources, and the large size and diversity of its end markets, we believe that the most efficient
way to tackle the distribution of its broad range of patient and professional products is by partnering with entities in selected geographies
that have either direct access to the end users or a desire and financial wherewithal to leverage the NovaVision therapy platform, including
into new areas. As a result, the Company closed the NovaVision German office and entered into a license agreement with HelferApp, a cognitive
therapy specialist, for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Management is also open to a broad range of alternatives for
NovaVision as a whole, which could comprise distribution and marketing partnerships, licensing, merger or sale.

are committed to an integrated total quality management system. We believe that we have completed the necessary procedures and Vycor
Medical is certified to the ISO standards expected of medical device manufacturers as follows:

ISO
13485:2016 Medical Devices Quality Management Systems 

The
certification of a quality management system to ISO 1348:2016, specifically for medical devices, is advantageous and often essential
for medical companies to export their products to the global market, as well as maintain and enter into certain agreements and business
growth opportunities within the U.S. For example, Canada requires that medical device manufacturers marketing their products in Canada
must have a quality system certified to ISO 13485:2016 and from January 1, 2019 also be certified to MDSAP. The certification is also
required for placement of branded devices into the European Union.

Medical Device License (MDL) for distribution in Canada as a Class II device. VBAS also has regulatory approvals in a number of other
international markets. NovaVison s VRT, NeuroEyeCoach and Sight Science s NeET have CE mark registrations as Class I devices
in Europe.

The
adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash of 262,528 in the period have no impact on liquidity. The change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 121,804 between
the 2022 and 2021 periods was mainly due to the settlement of expenses during the 2021 period incurred during the final quarter of 2020. 

Additional
inventory of 162,750 was purchased during the year ended December 31, 2022 as part of normal production and for the launch of the VBAS
AC, and the Company anticipates purchasing additional new inventory of approximately 75,000 during the next twelve months for VBAS
and VBAS AC. 

Investing
Activities. Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,780 compared to
 38,375 in 2021, which primarily reflected the expenditure on the VBAS AC during 2021. 

Financing
Activities. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company received funds of 172,500 in respect of loans from Fountainhead.
The Company had received a second loan of 58,600 during 2021 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP under
Division A, Title I of the CARES Act. Both loans received under the Paycheck Protection Program were forgiven in August 2021 and resulted
in an extinguishment of debt for 117,200, during 2021, which is included in the adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash provided by (used in) operating
activities section on the cash flow statement. 

Liquidity
and Plan of Operations, Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
has incurred losses since its inception, including a net loss of 404,917 and 435,662 for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021
respectively and has not generated sufficient cash flows from operations. As at December 31, 2022 the Company had a working capital deficiency
of 551,433 excluding related party liabilities of 2,585,600. As a result these conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

As described earlier in this ITEM 1
 Strategy , the Company is executing on
a plan to achieve a reduction in cash operating losses 2 . Included within the working capital deficiency above is a term
note for 300,000 to EuroAmerican Investment Corp. EuroAmerican ), together with accrued interest of 424,897, which
has a maturity date of December 31, 2023, having been extended on a number of occasions from its initial due date of June 11, 2011. At
this time, it is not known whether any further extension of the note beyond December 31, 2023 will be available. However, the Company
believes it may not have sufficient cash to meet its various cash needs through March 31, 2024 unless the Company is able to obtain
additional cash from the issuance of debt or equity securities. Fountainhead, the Company s largest shareholder, has provided
working capital funding to the Company on an as-needed basis, although there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case.
The Company may consider seeking additional equity or debt funding, although there is no assurance that this would be available on
acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may have to delay or curtail development or
commercialization of products or cease some of its operations.

Seasonality 

Our
operating results are not affected by seasonality. 

Inflation 

Our
business and operating results are not affected in any material way by inflation, although rising raw material and labor costs will result
in an increase in the cost of sales. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Uses
of estimates in the preparation of financial statements 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimated. To the extent management s estimates prove to be incorrect, financial results for future periods
may be adversely affected. Significant estimates and assumptions contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include
management s estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, provision for inventory obsolescence, useful life
of intangible assets, and the fair values of options and warrant included in the determination of debt discounts and stock based compensation. 

Revenue
Recognition 

On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related
amendments (new revenue standard) to all contracts. The adoption of the new accounting standard had no impact on company s consolidated
financial statements. 

Vycor
Medical generates revenue from the sale of its surgical access system to hospitals and other medical professionals. Vycor Medical records
revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the
transfer of control of the goods to customers. Vycor Medical does not provide for product returns or warranty costs. 

Vycor
determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

Identification
 of the contract, or contracts, with a customer 

Identification
 of the performance obligations in the contract 

Determination
 of the transaction price 

Allocation
 of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Recognition
 of revenue when Vycor satisfy a performance obligation 

NovaVision
generates revenues from various programs, therapy services and other sources such as software license sales. Therapy services revenues
represent fees from NovaVision s vision restoration therapy software, eye movement training software, diagnostic software, clinic
set up and training fees, and the professional and support services associated with the therapy. NovaVision provides vision restoration
therapy directly to patients. The typical therapy program consists of NeuroEyeCoach, performed over 2-4 weeks, and six modules of Vision
Restoration Therapy, performed over 6 months. A patient contract comprises set-up fees and monthly therapy fees. Set-up fees are recognized
at the outset of the contract and therapy revenue is recognized ratably over the therapy period. Patient therapy is restricted to being
completed by a patient within a specified time frame. 

Deferred
revenue results from patients paying for the therapy in advance of receiving the therapy. 

10 

Inventory 

Inventories
are stated at the weighted average cost method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price, in the ordinary course of business,
less estimated costs to complete and dispose of the product. If the Company identifies excess, obsolete or unsalable items, its inventories
are written down to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. The provision charge for inventory
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 13,160 and 12,360, respectively. Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory
purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of sales. 

Discontinued
Operations 

In
accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal
of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal
represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when the components
of an entity meets the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as held for sale. When all of the criteria to be classified
as held for sale are met, including management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the entity, the
major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and
liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations (which
we presented as operations to be disposed and operations disposed), less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components
of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45.

ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. 

Set

and the report thereon of Prager Metis CPAs, LLC (PCAOB ID No. 273),

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 

 Vycor
Medical, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vycor Medical, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses since inception, including a net loss of 404,917 and 435,662 for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and has not generated sufficient cash flows from its operations. As of December
31, 2022, the Company had working capital deficiency of 551,433, excluding related party liabilities of 2,585,600. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regards
to these matters are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. We determined that there is no critical audit matters for
the current audit period.

NovaVision
generates revenues from various programs, therapy services and other sources such as software license sales. Therapy services revenues
represent fees from NovaVision s vision restoration therapy software, eye movement training software, diagnostic software, clinic
set up and training fees, and the professional and support services associated with the therapy. NovaVision provides vision restoration
therapy directly to patients. The typical therapy program consists of NeuroEyeCoach, performed over 2-4 weeks, and six modules of Vision

Deferred
revenue results from patients paying for the therapy in advance of receiving the therapy. 

As
part of the adoption of ASC 606, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue. 

. Cash balances may at times exceed the FDIC insured limits. The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Included within cash are deposits paid
by patients, held by the Company until the patient returns the VRT device or chinrest at the end of therapy. At December 31, 2022 and
2021 patient deposits amounted to and , respectively, and are included in Accrued Liabilities.

purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of sales in the Company s consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 

First Draw Loan ), pursuant to the Paycheck Protection
Program (the PPP under Division A, Title I of the CARES Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received
an additional PPP loan of Second Draw Loan ). Under the terms of the PPP, both the First Draw Loan and Second Draw
Loan were forgiven during the year ended 2021 as they were used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act. 

The
Company accounted for the loans as a financial liability in accordance with FASB ASC 470 and accrued interest in accordance with the
interest method under FASB ASC 835-30. For purposes of derecognition of the liability, FASB ASC 470-50-15-4 refers to guidance in FASB
ASC 405-20. Based on this guidance, the proceeds of the loans were recorded as a liability until either (1) the loans are, in part or
wholly, forgiven and the Company has been legally released , or (2) the Company pays off the loans. The Company has accordingly
reduced the liability by the amount forgiven and recorded a gain on the extinguishment.

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net loss per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive
potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of preferred
stock and convertible debt. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce a net loss per share. No
dilution adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common shares in the periods presented because the assumed exercise
of outstanding options and warrants and the conversion of preferred stock and debt would be anti-dilutive.

Deferred
Income Taxes 

The
Company has operations in the US, Germany and the UK and incurred net operating losses since inception. The Company has not reflected
any tax benefit related to such net operating losses in the financial statements. Prior to August 15, 2007 the Company s US operating
entity was a limited liability company and losses were passed through to the individual members, therefore the Company only has potential
tax benefits from the date it became a C corporation. 

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company and its subsidiaries deferred
tax assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows:

Net

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income. 

The
authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets recorded if, based on the weight of the evidence,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Furthermore, in circumstances in
which management has determined that existing conditions or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
the authoritative guidance requires that a valuation allowance should be recorded for all deferred tax assets. Accordingly, management
has determined that a valuation allowance is appropriate at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

The Tax Act requires us to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax
at a rate of to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and on the remaining earnings. Since the Company s
foreign subsidiaries have not generated taxable income and have no accumulated earnings, the Company believes that the Tax Act will not
have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Net
Operating Loss Carry-Forwards 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had U.S. accumulated losses for tax purposes of approximately and 
respectively, which may be carried forward and offset against U.S. taxable income, and expire during the tax years 2029 through 2041. 

Federal
tax laws impose significant restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards and in the event of a change in ownership
of the Company, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company s net operating loss carry-forwards may be subject
to the above limitations. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had German accumulated losses for tax purposes of approximately and 
respectively, which may be carried forward and offset against German taxable income subject to certain restrictions and limitations in
the event of changes in the NovaVision GmbH s ownership. As disclosed in Note 3, the Company is in the process of winding down
the entity, following which these tax losses will no longer be available. 

As
of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had UK accumulated losses for tax purposes of approximately and respectively,
which may be carried forward and offset against UK taxable income subject to certain restrictions and limitations. 

Tax
Rates 

The
applicable US income tax rate for the Company for both of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was . Non-US subsidiaries are
taxed according to the tax laws in their respective country of residence. The German applicable rate for both of the years ended December

If
any earnings were distributed to US in the form of dividends or otherwise, after the repayment of intercompany debt, the Company would
be subject to additional US income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes.

The
Company has recorded no liability for income taxes associated with unrecognized tax benefits at the date of adoption and has not recorded
any liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits during 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, the Company has t recorded any interest

Potential
German tax liability 

In
June 2012 the Company s NovaVision German subsidiary received a preliminary assessment for Magdeburg City trade tax of 
(approximately ), with an additional interest charge of (approximately ). This assessment is for the 2010
fiscal year and relates to the Company s acquisition of the assets of the former NovaVision, Inc. An initial assessment for corporate
tax for the same period was preliminarily reduced to zero. The Company did not accept this trade tax assessment and appealed against
it to the relevant tax authorities with a view to its reduction. The relevant tax authorities agreed to suspend the assessment pending
the outcome of certain court hearings and proposed tax legislation, and the Company agreed to make monthly payments on account totaling
 (approximately which were completed in October 2016 and fully expensed. At that time the Company appealed against
the interest charge of (approximately which the tax authorities did not accept but also agreed to suspend pending
the outcome of the hearings and proposed legislation outlined above. Accordingly, the Company has made no provision for this liability
in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. The Company is in the process of winding down the entity, as disclosed in

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

a)
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer (also our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (also
our principal financial and accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company s management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO (the Company s principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer CFO (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and our CFO have concluded that a material weakness occurred as of April 1, 2021 with the resignation
of the independent members of the Company s Audit Committee as of that date. Effective that date, our disclosure and controls were
no longer effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its CEO and its CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The
matter involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be a material weakness under the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board was a lack of a functioning audit committee with independent members, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. This weakness occurred as of April 1, 2021
due to the resignation of the independent members of the Audit Committee from the Board of Directors effective as of April 1, 2021. 

Management
believes that the material weakness set forth did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the
lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement
in our financial statements in future periods. 

33 

b)
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

We
carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment
and on those criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December
31, 2022 due to the a lack of a functioning audit committee with independent members, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment
and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management s report in this annual report. 

c)
 Changes in Internal Controls 

Effective
April 1, 2021, the independent members of the Audit Committee resigned from the Board of Directors. There have been no other changes
in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

The
Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, do not expect that the Company s internal control over financial
reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

60 days of exercise of debentures, warrants and options, and the issuance of shares granted but not issued under the director s
Deferred Compensation Plan; and (b) the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of that class outstanding on April 14, 2023 (32,628,835
shares of Common Stock and 270,306 shares of Series D Preferred Stock) and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner
may acquire upon exercise of the debentures, warrants and options or that can be issued under the director s Deferred Compensation
