BUSINESS General Overview We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 13, 2013. From inception, it was our intent to import small farming, household gardening and general small tools directly from manufacturers and market to consumers in the Republic of India. Management of our company is currently evaluating our future strategic business plans. On June 24, 2016, Katiuska Moran our former CEO and Director and Surjeet Singh, our former secretary and a substantial shareholder cancelled any and all loans they made to our company. On June 24, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest our company, Katiuska Moran our former CEO and Director and Surjeet Singh (individually and collectively the Seller(s) our company, entered into and closed on certain Share Purchase Agreements (the Agreements with Aureas Capital Co., Ltd., whereby Aureas purchased from the Sellers a total of 6,918,800 shares of our company s common stock (the Shares for an aggregate price of 100,000.00. The Shares acquired represented approximately 70.6 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of our company. Concurrently with the closing of the Agreements, Ming Chun Lung was appointed a director, Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary and Katiuska Moran and Surjeet Singh resigned from all positions held as an officer and director of our company. On June 8, 2017, Ming Chun Lung resigned as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and as a director of our company and Kong Nguan Hong was appointed Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and as a director. Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the Agreement ), effective as of April 4, 2018, by and among Aureas Capital Co Ltd, Chen Yi-Dou, Ming-Chun Lung, NYJJ Investments, Ti-Jung Chen, Yi-Fang Lin and Zhiqing Wu (together, the Sellers and Haiping Hu (the Purchaser ), the Sellers sold an aggregate of 9,797,600 shares of Common Stock of our company, to the Purchaser for cash consideration of 360,000 from personal funds of the Purchaser (the Transaction ). Of the net proceeds, 7,500 have been held back in escrow for the payment of past due taxes. Following consummation of the Transaction on April 4, 2018, the Purchaser holds 99.5 of the voting securities of our company, based on 9,850,000 shares issued and outstanding as at that date. The Transaction resulted in a change in control of our Company. 4 Table of Contens In connection with the Transaction, Kong Nguan Hong, the sole officer and director of the Company, resigned from all of his officer positions with our company, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, effective immediately upon the consummation of the Transaction, and remained a director of our company until April 16, 2018, which date was ten (10) days following the date on which our company filed a Schedule 14F-1 with the SEC and mailed same to the holders of record of our company, in connection with the Transaction. Our address is 986 Dongfang Rd., One Hundred Shanshan Bldg 25th Fl, Pudong, Shanghai, China 200122. Our telephone number is +86 136 1833 3008. We do not have any subsidiaries. We do not have a corporate website. We have not ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. Our Current Business We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements. Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail. Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTCMarkets, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market. We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries. In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our sole officer and director will continue to manage the Company. As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K. We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities. 5 Table of Contens Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions. Research and Development We have incurred Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years. Intellectual Property We do not currently have any intellectual property. Employees Our company has no employees. Our sole director and officer is donating his time to the development of our company, and intends to do whatever work is necessary to bring us to the point of earning revenues. We estimate that our sole officer and director will be able to complete his required work and complete whatever work is necessary by spending 20 hours per week without lending our company additional funds. If this is not the case and additional time and funds will be required, then he is willing to commit additional time and funds although he has no commitment or contractual obligation to do so. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future. We will be engaging independent contractors to design and develop our website and manage our internet marketing efforts. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive is currently located at 986 Dongfang Rd., One Hundred Shanshan Bldg 25 th Fl, Pudong, Shanghai, China 200122. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. To date, our company has never been involved in litigation, as either a party or a witness, nor has our company been involved in any legal proceedings commenced by any regulatory agency against our company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. 6 Table of Contens PART II ITEM 5.

Net loss, all from operating expenses, was 48,115 for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 29,656 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees. Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were 48,115 and 29,656, respectively. Expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees.

During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company s shareholder and sole officer paid 48,653 and 29,756, respectively, on behalf of the Company for operating expenses. Investing Activities The Company did not use any funds for investing activities during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Financing Activities The Company did not have any funds provided by financing activities during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital There is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have generated no revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in developing our website, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services. At present, we do not have enough cash on hand to cover operating costs for the next 12 months. If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either our operations, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue, develop, or expand our operations. We have no plans to undertake any product research and development during the next twelve months. There are also no plans or expectations to acquire or sell any plant or plant equipment in the next year of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2022, we had no cash and our current assets were 750. As of September 30, 2022, our current liabilities were 142,697, and our stockholders deficit was 141,947. We do not have sufficient funds to operate for the next twelve months. We have to issue debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party in order to finance our operations. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Going Concern For the year ended September 30, 2022, our company had a net loss of 48,115 and has earned no revenues. In addition, the Company had a working capital deficiency of 141,947 and an accumulated deficit of 321,327 at September 30, 2022. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 9 Table of Contens The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing, shareholder loans and to commence profitable operations in the future and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations as they become due. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending September 30, 2023. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe there are no material estimates or assumptions with levels of subjectivity and judgement necessary to be considered critical accounting policies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing, shareholder loans and to commence profitable operations in the future and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations as they become due. The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for future periods. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders. Change in valuation allowance Income tax expense The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company s net deferred tax assets are as follows: Valuation allowance Net deferred tax assets F-9 Table of Contens of net operating losses NOL ), generated from April 4, 2018 to September 30, 2022, carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. NOLs generated in tax years prior to September 30, 2018, can be carryforward for twenty years, whereas NOLs generated after September 30, 2018 can be carryforward indefinitely. Due to a change of control, the Company will not be able to carryover of NOL generated before April 4, 2018 to offset future income. A valuation allowance has been established for our deferred tax assets as their use is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable income, which cannot be predicted at this time. As of September 30, 2022, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. No interest and penalties have been recognized by us to date.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2022 due to the material weaknesses discussed below. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related information. Management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present fairly, in material respects, our financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the Exchange Act. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Under the supervision of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and subsequent guidance prepared by the Commission specifically for smaller public companies as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2022 because it identified the following material weakness: Material Weakness - The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements, nor allowed for adequate segregation of duties. 11 Table of Contens A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future which we believe mitigates the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP and establish an audit committee and implement internal controls and procedures, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to SEC rules that permit us to provide only management s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common and preferred stock, except as otherwise indicated.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 14, 2023. As of April 14, 2023, there were 9,850,000 shares of our company s common stock issued and outstanding.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer, shareholder holding at least 5 of shares of our common stock, or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended September 30, 2022, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last three completed fiscal years: During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company s sole officer advanced to the Company an amount of 48,653 and 29,756 respectively by paying for expenses on behalf of the Company. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company was obligated to the officer for a balance of 141,496 and 92,843, respectively, which is unsecured, non-interest-bearing and due on demand. Director Independence We currently act with one director, Haiping Hu.

All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
