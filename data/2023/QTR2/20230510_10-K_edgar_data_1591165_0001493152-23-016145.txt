FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION 

This
Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements relate to future events or the Company s future financial performance.
H-CYTE has attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using terminology including anticipates, believes, 
 expects, can, continue, could, estimates, intends, 
 may, plans, potential, predict, should or will or
the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may
cause the Company s actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future
results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although H-CYTE believes
that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity,
performance, or achievements. The Company s expectations are as of the date this Annual Report is filed, and it does not intend
to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Annual Report is filed to confirm these statements to actual results,
unless required by law. 

This
Annual Report also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by H-CYTE relating to market size and
growth and other industry data. This data involves several assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight
to such estimates. The Company has not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties
and contained in this Annual Report and, accordingly, it cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though it does generally believe
the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions, and estimates of H-CYTE s future performance and the future performance
of the industries in which it operates are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors.
H-CYTE s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including,
but not limited to, the possibility that it may fail to preserve its expertise in medical therapy and product research and development;
that existing and potential partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if its competitors offer more favorable
products or pricing terms; that it may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that it may be unable to attain and maintain
profitability; that it may be unable to attract and retain key personnel; that it may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase,
its relationships with customers; that it may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses; the effect the current COVID-19 pandemic
will have on the Company as further discussed herein. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed
in the estimates made by the independent parties and by H-CYTE.

 BUSINESS 

Overview 

H-CYTE,
Inc the Company has evolved from focusing on treating chronic lung conditions after the closure of its lung
treatment clinics due to COVID-19. The Company is currently focusing on acquiring and developing early-stage companies or
their technologies in the areas of therapeutics, medical devices, and diagnostics. The goal is to develop these companies and
incubate their technologies to meaningful clinical inflection points. 

On
June 3, 2022, the Company closed its clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Company has now closed all of its clinical operations in the
autologous infusion therapy business which delivered treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders. The Company
will continue to pursue Food and Drug Administration FDA approval of the device that was utilized in the treatment provided at the clinics. The Company also
has a continued interest in the commercialization of the DenerveX device through a joint venture. The Company has implemented the transition into a biologics
and therapeutic device incubator company to bring new technologies to market. 

The
consolidated results for H-CYTE include the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: H-CYTE Management, LLC, Medovex Corp, Cognitive Health
Institute, LLC, and Lung Institute Tampa, LLC and the results include Lung Institute Dallas, LLC LI Dallas ), Lung Institute
Nashville, LLC LI Nashville ), Lung Institute Pittsburgh, LLC LI Pittsburgh ), and Lung Institute Scottsdale,
LLC LI Scottsdale ), as Variable Interest Entities VIEs ). Additionally, H-CYTE Management, LLC was the operator
and manager of the various Lung Health Institute (LHI) clinics: LI Dallas, LI Nashville, LI Pittsburgh, and LI Scottsdale. The LI Dallas
and LI Pittsburgh clinics did not reopen in 2020 after the temporary closure of all LI clinics due to COVID-19. These two clinics will
remain permanently closed. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company decided to close the LI Tampa and LI Nashville clinics. During
the second quarter of 2022, the Company closed the LI Scottsdale clinic. All LHI clinics are closed as of December 31, 2022. 

On
June 10, 2022, the Company amended (the Amendment its Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a one-for-one thousand reverse
stock split (the Reverse Split of its common stock. The Reverse Split was approved by FINRA on June 10, 2022 and effectuated
on June 13, 2022. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company also reduced the authorized shares of common stock to 500,000,000. As a result
of the Reverse Split, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has 618,506 shares of common stock outstanding and 438,776,170 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Series A Preferred Stock conversion ratio is now one
thousand shares of Series A Preferred Stock converts into one share of common stock. Accordingly, the 438,776,170 outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock are now convertible into an aggregate of 438,776 shares of common stock. 

On
September 7, 2022, the Company acquired all of the membership interests, with common stock, of Jantibody LLC Jantibody ), a Nevada limited
liability company. Jantibody is focused on the development of novel proprietary immunotherapies targeted towards ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and mesothelioma (see Note 8). 

On December 22, 2022, the Company acquired all the membership interests, with common stock, in Scion Solutions, LLC Scion ). Scion is a life sciences company
that has developed a new technology in regenerative medicine specifically for limb salvage. Their proprietary product SkinDisc (patent
pending) is a combination of stem cells and several other molecular components that stimulate tissue regeneration (see Note 8). 

Impact
of COVID-19 

COVID-19
was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and the Company continues to monitor the impact on
its operations of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The Company believes the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain public
and governmental responses to it have negatively affected its results since the pandemic s inception. 

During
the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the Company experienced material reductions in demand and net revenues at its lung treatment
centers. This reduction in demand led to the Company shifting its focus from treating chronic lung disease to acquiring and developing
early-stage companies or their technologies in the areas of therapeutics, medical devices, and diagnostics. 

4 

Autologous
Infusion Therapy Infusion Division 

The
Company s Infusion Division developed and implemented innovative treatment options in autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to
treat chronic lung disorders. During the first quarter of 2022, the clinics in Tampa and Nashville
closed. During the second quarter of 2022, the clinic in Scottsdale closed. All clinical operations in the autologous infusion
therapy division which delivered treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders have now closed. 

Biotech
Development Biotech Division 

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed a review of the R D status regarding the exclusive product supply and services
agreements with Rion, LLC Rion to develop and distribute (post U.S. Food Drug Administration, the FDA ,
approval) a biologic combining its PRP-PBMC PRP technology with Rion s exosomes EV technology for
the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD ). The Company has determined a single entity biologic from
an alternative commercial source will be a more viable solution. The Company has decided to move away from Rion s PRP technology
and is progressing towards alternate biologics and therapeutic devices to meet the needs of the business. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has closed all of the LHI clinics and has moved away from the Infusion Division as part of its future plans.
The Company has also decided that the Biotech Division will begin to transform into a medical biosciences incubator division focusing
on bringing new biologics and therapeutic device technologies to market for various health conditions. 

Competition 

Developing
and commercializing new FDA approved drugs and therapies is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and
clinical efforts and rapid technological change. The Company faces intense competition worldwide from pharmaceutical, biomedical technology,
medical therapy, and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. The Company may be unable to respond to
technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of the Company s existing and potential competitors
have substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, and technological resources. These competitors
may also be in the process of seeking FDA (or other regulatory approvals) and patent protection for new products. The Company s
biologics and device product lines also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered
part of the standard of care. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets are: 

determining
 and progressing suitable biological therapies for specific disease states and the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 

acceptance
 by physicians and the medical community; 

ease
 of use and reliability; 

technical
 leadership and superiority; 

effective
 marketing and distribution; 

speed
 to market; and 

price
 and qualification for insurance coverage and reimbursement. 

5 

The
Company will also compete in the marketplace to recruit qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring
technologies and licenses which it believes will be complementary to its products or advantageous to its business. 

The
Company is aware that several of its competitors are developing technologies in its current and future products areas. There are numerous
autologous cellular therapy providers who make unsubstantiated claims that they are able to treat chronic lung disease. Most of these
competitors are small clinics with little brand recognition. The landscape is changing as pharma and biologics companies, as well as
academia, begin to develop therapies for multiple diseases using regenerative medicine through the more stringent regulatory pathway
of a Biologics License Application (BLA). 

Customers 

The
Company s infusion division customer base consisted of individuals who were suffering from chronic lung disease that are searching
for alternative or adjunct forms of treatment outside of traditional pharmaceutical care which has not been successful for them in the
past. 

Government
Regulations 

Governmental
authorities in the United States U.S. at the federal, state, and local levels) and abroad extensively regulate, among other things, the research and
development, testing, manufacture, quality control, clinical research, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion,
advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of products such as those we are
developing. 

FDA
Regulation 

In
the U.S., the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review. If the Company does not comply with applicable requirements,
it may be fined, the government may refuse to approve its marketing applications or to allow it to manufacture or market its products,
and the Company may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil
penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating
restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. 

6 

Good
Manufacturing Practices GMP 

United
States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 

In
the U. S., there are Federal and State anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration
intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and
criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers
of products regulated by the FDA as pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, and hospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers
of such products. Other provisions of Federal and State laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented,
to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided
as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report
all gifts and payments of over 50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials. 

Although
the Company intends to structure its future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of its products to comply
with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of the Company s business practices in the future could be subject
to scrutiny and challenged by Federal or State enforcement officials under these laws. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development costs and expenses consist primarily of fees paid to external service providers, laboratory testing, supplies, costs
for facilities and equipment, and other costs for research and development activities. Research and development expenses are recorded
in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 

Employees 

As
of April 30, 2023, the Company had two full-time employees. None of its employees are represented by a union.

Impact
of COVID-19 

COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and the Company continues to monitor the impact
on its operations of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The Company believes the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain public
and governmental responses to it have negatively affected its results since the pandemic s inception. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the Company experienced material reductions in demand and net revenues at its lung treatment
centers. This reduction in demand led to the Company shifting its focus from treating chronic lung disease to acquiring and developing
early-stage companies or their technologies in the areas of therapeutics, medical devices, and diagnostics.

Liquidity, Going Concern, and Sources of Liquidity 

The Company had a negative cash balance of approximately 4,000 as of December 31, 2022, which is included in current liabilities, and cash on hand of approximately 3,000 as of
May 8, 2023. The Company s cash is insufficient to fund its operations over the next year and the Company is currently working
to obtain additional debt or equity financing to help support working capital needs. 

The
Company has historically incurred losses from operations and expects to continue acquisitions and generate negative cash flows as the Company implements its updated strategic business plan. The Company will need to raise cash from
debt and equity offerings to continue its operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in doing
so. 

Going
Concern 

The
Company incurred net losses of approximately 10,300,000 and 4,799,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The Company has historically incurred losses from operations and expects to continue to generate negative cash flows as it implements
its plan around the Biosciences Division. The consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States U.S. GAAP as applicable to a going concern. 

COVID-19
has adversely affected the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the extent to which
its financial condition and results of operations will be affected. 

10 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or that the terms and conditions of any future financing
will be workable or acceptable to the Company or its shareholders. If the Company is unable to fund its acquisitions and operations from
existing cash on hand, operating cash flows, additional borrowings, or raising equity capital, the Company may not continue operations.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern. 

Sources of Liquidity 

With
the Company historically having experienced losses, the primary source of liquidity has been raising capital through debt and equity
offerings, as described below. 

Debt 

Convertible
Notes Payable

investor of the April 2021 Note Purchase Agreement, FWHC Bridge, LLC, advanced 1,500,000 of the total amount to the Company. FWHC
Bridge, LLC is an affiliated entity of FWHC, LLC, which is a principal stockholder and related party of the Company. An additional
affiliate of FWHC, LLC provided an additional 25,000 as part of the April 2021 Note Purchase Agreement. 

On
October 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Closing Bring Down Agreement (the October 2021 Note Purchase
Agreement whereby the five (5) related party investors who had entered into the April 2021 Note Purchase Agreement purchased
new notes in the Company in the aggregate principal amount of 750,000. The Notes are due and payable on June 17, 2022 and bear
interest at an annual rate of 8 . The Notes are convertible into shares of Common Stock at a discount of 20 to the price paid for
such New Securities in the next financing that meets the definition of a Qualified Financing as defined in the Note Purchase
Agreement. The Notes are secured by all of the assets of the Company under a security agreement with the Holders. The lead investor
of the October 2021 Note Purchase Agreement, FWHC Bridge, LLC, advanced 437,000 of the total amount to the Company. FWHC Bridge,
LLC is an affiliated entity of FWHC, LLC, which is a principal stockholder and related party of the Company. An additional affiliate

On
February 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement (the Amendment Agreement which i) provided for
an additional round of convertible debt financing Tranche 2 Notes of up to 500,000 and ii) amended the conversion price
on the convertible notes issued April 1, 2021 and October 8, 2021 (Tranche 1 Notes from 80 of the price paid in a Qualified
Financing (proceeds of at least 15 million), to the lesser of (x) 0.002 and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing (proceeds of
at least 10 million). The Amendment Agreement also provides the following Milestone Payments: 

3) 
 1,000,000
 after filing a premarket notification pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, of its intent to market its
 PRP cellular therapy 

4) 
 Following
 the closing of a Qualified financing, 25 of all proceeds raised in excess of 10 million (not to exceed 1 million) 

11 

The
Milestone Payments are not to exceed 2 million, and the Amendment Agreement also specifies that a Qualified Financing will not occur
prior to the closing of the acquisition of Jantibody, LLC. 

The
Company evaluated the Amendment Agreement under ASC 470-50, Debt - Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded that
probability of having to pay a Milestone payment was minimal and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature was not material.
Since the Amendment did not cause a material change in cash flows, extinguishment accounting was not applicable. 

On
April 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Conversion Agreement (the Note Conversion Agreement with certain holders of its Tranche 1 Notes (i) providing for a conversion price equal to the lesser of (x) 0.002 per share (pre-split)
and (y) the price per share paid by the investors in a Qualified Financing for such New Securities purchased for cash and not through
conversion of Notes (as such terms are defined in the Note Conversion Agreement), in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization, (ii) automatic conversion upon the occurrence
of a Qualified Financing, and (iii) amendment of the maturity date from March 31, 2022 to June 17, 2022 (the New Notes ).
Upon the effectiveness of the Company s 1,000-1 reverse split, the conversion price adjusted to the lesser of (a) the price in
Qualified Financing or (b) 2.00 per share. The New Notes also provided the investors with Royalty Payments equal to 15 of all net sales
generated by the Company with respect to the sale of products or services associated with the 510(k) Notification related to the Company s
autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat chronic lung disorder. The Royalty Payments are in lieu of the Milestone payments but
are perpetual and there is no limit to the aggregate amount of Royalty Payments that may be paid. 

Due
to changes in key provisions of the Tranche 1 Notes, the Company analyzed the before and after cash flows between the (i) fair value
of the New Notes and (ii) reacquisition price of the Tranche 1 Notes prior to the (A) change in the maturity date from March 31, 2022
to June 17, 2022, (B) change in the conversion price to the lesser of (x) 2.00 and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing, and
(C) the fair value of the potential Royalty Payments, to determine whether these changes resulted in a modification or extinguishment
of the Tranche 1 Notes. 

The
Company used a discounted cash flow method with Monte Carlo Simulation to value the Royalty Payments. Future Royalty Payments were estimated
based on management s best estimate of future cash flows under various scenarios which were discounted to present value using a
risk-adjusted rate of 70 . 

Based
on the before and after cash flows of each note, the change was considered significantly different. Consequently, the New Notes were
accounted for as a debt extinguishment of the Tranche 1 Notes and a new debt issuance of the New Notes. The Company recorded approximately
a 2,200,000 loss upon extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was comprised of the following: 

Carrying value of Tranche 1
 Notes 
 3,580,738 
 
 Less: Fair value of New Notes 
 (4,079,838 
 
 Less: Fair value
 of Royalty Payments 
 (1,697,000 
 
 Loss on Extinguishment 
 (2,196,100 

The
Note Conversion Agreement also provided for the consummation of a Tranche 2 Financing (the Tranche 2 Notes subject to
(i) the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness represented by the Tranche 2 Notes being capped at 500,000 and (ii) Tranche 2 Notes 
being an unsecured obligation of the Company and expressly subordinate in all respects to all indebtedness of the Company under the Notes
and including language in which the holders of such Tranche 2 Notes acknowledge, confirm and agree to the foregoing subordination terms.
Pursuant to the terms of the Note Conversion Agreement, the Investors have agreed not to sell any capital stock of the Company for a
period of 12 months following the Qualified Financing. The Company is currently working with the noteholders on the extension of the maturity of the outstanding notes. 

On
June 9, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a total of 272,500 with two accredited investors. The notes
issued are convertible into common stock at a 65 discount to the lowest trading price in the 20-day period prior to conversion. The
notes bear interest at 10 and are due one year from issuance. For the first six months, the Company has the right to prepay the notes
at a premium of between 25 and 35 depending on when it is repaid. 

The
Company also issued a promissory note for 100,000, on June 9, 2022, to another accredited investor. This note bears interest at 15 (no matter when repaid)
and converts at a discount of 25 of the price of a public offering or a 25 discount to the VWAP of the five (5) days prior to conversion. 

12 

The
embedded features in the convertible notes were analyzed under Accounting Standards Codification 815- Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) to determine if they required bifurcation as
derivative instruments. To be a derivative, one of the criteria is that the embedded component must be net-settleable. While the
Company s Common Stock was traded on an exchange at the time of the transaction, the underlying shares are not readily
convertible into cash since there is insufficient daily trading volume for the holders to convert the convertible notes into Common
Stock without significantly affecting the share price. Accordingly, the embedded derivatives, including the embedded conversion
feature, did not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, did not require bifurcation from the host instrument. Certain
default put provisions, including a default put and default interest, were not considered to be clearly and closely related to the
host instrument but the Company concluded that the value of these provisions was de minimus at inception. The Company will
reconsider the value of these provisions each reporting period to determine if the value becomes material to the financial
statements. 

On
August 8, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a total of 65,000 with an accredited investor. The note
issued is convertible into common stock at a 65 discount to the lowest trading price in the 20-day period prior to conversion. The note
bears interest at 10 and is due one year from issuance. For the first six (6) months, the Company has the right to prepay the notes
at a premium of between 25 and 40 depending on when it is repaid. 

On
February 24, 2023, the Company and certain investors entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the
 SPA ), whereby the Company sold and issued to the certain investors an aggregate of three hundred thousand dollars 300,000)

Indemnification 

We
have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or
was serving, at our request, in such capacity, to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. However,
we maintain directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute, up to certain limits, a portion of any future amounts paid
for indemnification of directors and officers. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
insurance coverage is minimal. Historically, we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under
these types of indemnities. 

Additionally,
in the normal course of business, we have made certain guarantees, indemnities, and commitments under which we may be required to make
payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities include intellectual property and other indemnities to our customers
and distribution network partners in connection with the sales of our products and therapies, and indemnities to various lessors in connection
with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease. 

It
is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these guarantees, indemnities, and commitments due to our limited history
of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. 

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
those described in greater detail below. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting policies
are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 

Fair
Value Measurements 

The
Company measures certain non-financial assets, liabilities, and equity issuances at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These non-recurring
valuations include evaluating assets such as long-lived assets and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment; allocating value
to assets in an acquired asset group; and applying accounting for business combinations. 

The
Company classifies its stock warrants as either liability or equity instruments in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), depending on the specific terms of the warrant
agreement. 

The
Company uses the fair value measurement framework to value these assets and report the fair values in the periods in which they are recorded,
adjusted above, or written down. 

The
fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure
fair values in their broad levels. These levels from highest to lowest priority are as follows: 

Level 1: Quoted prices
 (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: Quoted prices
 in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but
 corroborated by market data; and 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs
 or valuation techniques that are used when little or no market data is available. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate
level in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. Although
the Company believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate at December 31, 2022, these fair
values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with U.S. GAAP as outlined in the FASB ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers ,
which requires that five steps be completed to determine when revenue can be recognized: (i) identify the contract with the customer;
(ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price;
and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company records revenue under ASC 606 as services
are performed for the customer. 

15 

The
Company uses a standard pricing model for the types of cellular therapy treatments that is offered to its patients. The transaction price
accounts for medical, surgical, facility, and office services rendered by the Company for consented procedures and is recorded as revenue.
The Company recognizes revenue when the terms of a contract with a patient are satisfied. 

The
Company offers two types of cellular therapy treatments to their patients: 

1) 
 The first type of treatment
 includes medical services rendered typically over a two-day period in which the patient receives cellular therapy. For this treatment
 type, revenue is recognized in full at time of service. 

2) 
 The Company also offers
 a four-day treatment in which medical services are rendered typically over a two-day period and then again, approximately three months
 later, medical services are rendered for an additional two days of treatment. Payment is collected in full for both service periods
 at the time the first treatment is rendered. Revenue is recognized when services are performed based on the estimated standalone
 selling price of each service. 

The
Company s policy is to not offer refunds to patients. However, in limited instances the Company may make exceptions to this policy
for extenuating circumstances. These instances are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may result in a patient refund. Management performed
an analysis of its customer refund history for refunds issued related to prior year s revenue. Management used the results of this
historical refund analysis to record a reserve for anticipated future refunds related to recognized revenue, which is not significant at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has now closed
all of its clinical operations in the autologous infusion therapy business which delivered treatments for patients with chronic respiratory
and pulmonary disorders. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4) during the periods presented, investments
in special-purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally, we are not a party to any derivative contracts or synthetic
leases. 

Recently
Adopted Accounting Standards 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which amends the approaches
and methodologies in accounting for income taxes during interim periods and makes changes to certain income tax classifications. The
new standard allows exceptions to the use of the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, when there is a loss from continuing
operations and income or a gain from other items, and to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, when
a year-to date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The standard also requires franchise or similar taxes partially based
on income to be reported as income tax and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be included in the annual effective
tax rate computation from the date of enactment. Lastly, in any future acquisition, the Company would be required to evaluate when the
step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is part of the business combination and when it should be considered a separate transaction. The
Company adopted ASU 2019-12, as required, on January 1, 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06. Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
 Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics
of liabilities and equity. Specifically, ASU 2020-06 revises the requirements to separately account for conversion features as a derivative
under ASC Topic 815 and it removes the requirement to account for beneficial conversion features on such instruments. The Company chose
early adoption of ASU 2020-06 effective January 1, 2021, related to the April 2021 and October 2021 Note Purchase Agreements. Thus, the
Notes did not require consideration for a beneficial conversion feature under ASC 470-20 and the Notes were accounted for solely as debt
on the balance sheet.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of H-CYTE, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of H-CYTE, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations
and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital, has an accumulated deficit, has a history of significant
operating losses and has a history of negative operating cash flow that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit
matters.

. As a result
of the Reverse Split, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has shares of common stock outstanding and shares of
Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Series A Preferred Stock conversion ratio is now one
thousand shares of Series A Preferred Stock converts into one share of common stock. Accordingly, the outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock are now convertible into an aggregate of shares of common stock. 

On
September 7, 2022, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of Jantibody LLC Jantibody ), a Nevada limited
liability company. Jantibody is focused on the development of novel proprietary immunotherapies targeted towards ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and mesothelioma (see Note 8). 

On December 22, 2022, the Company acquired all of the membership interests in Scion Solutions, LLC Scion ). Scion is a life sciences company
that has developed a new technology in regenerative medicine specifically for limb salvage. Their proprietary product SkinDisc (patent
pending) is a combination of stem cells and several other molecular components that stimulate tissue regeneration. (see Note 8). 

Autologous
Infusion Therapy Infusion Division 

The
Company s Infusion Division develops and implements innovative treatment options in autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat
chronic lung disorders. Committed to an individualized patient-centric approach, this division consistently provides oversight and management
of the highest quality care to the LHI clinics located in Tampa, Nashville, and Scottsdale, while producing positive medical outcomes
following the strictest CDC guidelines. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company decided to close the clinics in Tampa and Nashville.
During the second quarter of 2022, the Company closed its clinic in Scottsdale. The Company has now closed all clinical operations in
the autologous infusion therapy division which delivered treatments for patients with chronic respiratory and pulmonary disorders. 

Biotech
Development Biotech Division 

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed a review of the R D status regarding the exclusive product supply and services
agreements with Rion, LLC Rion to develop and distribute (post U.S. Food Drug Administration, the FDA ,
approval) a biologic combining its PRP-PBMC PRP technology with Rion s exosomes EV technology for
the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD ). The Company has determined a single entity biologic from
an alternative commercial source will be a more viable solution. The Company has decided to move away from Rion s PRP technology
and is progressing towards alternate biologics and therapeutic devices to meet the needs of the business. 

As
of June 30, 2022, the Company has closed all of the LHI clinics and has moved away from the Infusion Division as part of its future plans.
The Company has also decided that the Biotech Division will begin to transform into a medical biosciences incubator division focusing
on bringing new biologics and therapeutic device technologies to market for various health conditions. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its VIEs. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

allowance is necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded bad debt
expense of approximately and , respectively. 

In
February 2021, the Company implemented a patient financing program whereby it utilized third-party financing companies to facilitate
financing to its patients to pay for treatments. The financing structure allows patients to make monthly payments to the financing companies
with an interest rate ranging from based on the patient s credit score with contract terms ranging from to
 months. The Company subsequently receives a payment from the financing company net of the finance company s service fees plus
interest. The Company earns interest income from these arrangements which are reflected in interest income in the Company s financials
and combined with interest expense to reflect the net expense. Accounts receivable for financed treatments are listed as Patient
financing receivable, current portion and Patient financing receivable, net of current portion . 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes .
Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the difference turns around. The Company
accounts for interest and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than
not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances the Company considers projected future
taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. 

From
inception to December 31, 2022, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no current income tax liability. The net deferred
tax asset generated by these losses is fully offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 since it is currently likely
that the benefit will not be realized in future periods. 

There
are no uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has not undergone any tax examinations since inception. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

The
Company evaluates its financial liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level
in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. Although the Company
believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate at December 31, 2022, these fair values may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. 

for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company had a negative cash balance
of approximately as of December 31, 2022, which is included in current liabilities, and has historically incurred losses from operations and expects to continue to generate
negative cash flows as the Company implements its plan to transition the Biotech Division into a medical biosciences incubator division
focusing on bringing new biologics and therapeutic device technologies to market for various health conditions. The consolidated financial
statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP as applicable to
a going concern. 

COVID-19
was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 and the Company continues to monitor the impact on
its operations of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The Company believes the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain public
and certain governmental responses to it have negatively affected each of its last twelve quarter s results. 

During
the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath the Company experienced material reductions in demand and net revenues at its lung treatment
centers. This reduction in demand lead to the Company shifting its focus from treating chronic lung disease to acquiring and developing
early-stage companies or their technologies in the areas of therapeutics, medical devices, and diagnostics. 

The
Company had a negative cash balance of approximately as of December 31, 2022, and approximately , as of April 30, 2023.
The Company s cash is insufficient to fund its operations over the next year and the Company is currently working to obtain additional
debt or equity financing to help support short-term working capital needs. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds or that the terms and conditions of any future financing
will be workable or acceptable to the Company or its shareholders. If the Company is unable to fund its operations from existing cash
on hand, operating cash flows, additional borrowings, or raising equity capital, the Company may not continue operations. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

an additional round of convertible debt financing Tranche 2 Notes of up to and ii) amended the conversion price
on the convertible notes issued April 1, 2021 and October 8, 2021 Tranche 1 Notes from of the price paid in a Qualified
Financing (proceeds of at least million), to the lesser of (x) and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing (proceeds of
at least million). The Amendment Agreement also provides the following Milestone Payments: 

1) 
 
 after filing a premarket notification pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, of its intent to market its
 PRP cellular therapy 

2) 
 Following
 the closing of a Qualified financing, of all proceeds raised in excess of million (not to exceed 1 million) 

The
Milestone Payments are not to exceed 2 million, and the Amendment Agreement also specifies that a Qualified Financing will not occur
prior to the closing of the acquisition of Jantibody, LLC. 

The
Company evaluated the Amendment Agreement under ASC 470-50, Debt - Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded that
probability of having to pay a Milestone payment was minimal and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature was not material.
Since the Amendment did not cause a material change in cash flows, extinguishment accounting was not applicable. 

On
April 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Conversion Agreement (the Note Conversion Agreement with certain holders of its Tranche 1 Notes (i) providing for a conversion price equal to the lesser of (x) 0.002 per share (pre-split)
and (y) the price per share paid by the investors in a Qualified Financing for such New Securities purchased for cash and not through
conversion of Notes (as such terms are defined in the Note Conversion Agreement), in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization, (ii) automatic conversion upon the occurrence

 per share. The New Notes also provided the investors with Royalty Payments equal to of all net
sales generated by the Company with respect to the sale of products or services associated with the 510(k) Notification related to the
Company s autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat chronic lung disorder. The Royalty Payments are in lieu of the Milestone
payments but are perpetual and there is no limit to the aggregate amount of Royalty Payments that may be paid. 

Due
to changes in key provisions of the Tranche 1 Notes, the Company analyzed the before and after cash flows between the (i) fair value
of the New Notes and (ii) reacquisition price of the Tranche 1 Notes prior to the (A) change in the maturity date from March 31, 2022
to June 17, 2022, (B) change in the conversion price to the lesser of (x) and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing, and
(C) the fair value of the potential Royalty Payments, to determine whether these changes resulted in a modification or extinguishment
of the Tranche 1 Notes. 

The
Company used a discounted cash flow method with Monte Carlo Simulation to value the Royalty Payments. Future Royalty Payments were estimated
based on management s best estimate of future cash flows under various scenarios which were discounted to present value using a
risk-adjusted rate of . 

Based
on the before and after cash flows of each note, the change was considered significantly different. Consequently, the New Notes were
accounted for as a debt extinguishment of the Tranche 1 Notes and a new debt issuance of the New Notes. The Company recorded a million
loss upon extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2022, which was comprised of the following: 

Less: Fair value of New Notes 

Less: Fair value of
 Royalty Payments 

Loss on Extinguishment 

The
Note Conversion Agreement also provided for the consummation of a Tranche 2 Financing (the Tranche 2 Notes subject to
(i) the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness represented by the Tranche 2 Notes being capped at 
 and (ii) Tranche 2 Notes being an unsecured
obligation of the Company and expressly subordinate in all respects to all indebtedness of the Company under the Notes and including
language in which the holders of such Tranche 2 Notes acknowledge, confirm and agree to the foregoing subordination terms. Pursuant to
the terms of the Note Conversion Agreement, the Investors have agreed not to sell any capital stock of the Company for a period of 12
months following the Qualified Financing. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 
 of amortization of the debt premium is included

are due one year from issuance. 

The Company also issued a
promissory note for , on June 9, 2022, to another accredited investor. 

The embedded features in the convertible notes were
analyzed under Accounting Standards Codification 815- Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) to determine if they required bifurcation
as derivative instruments. To be a derivative, one of the criteria is that the embedded component must be net-settleable. While the Company s
Common Stock was traded on an exchange at the time of the transaction, the underlying shares are not readily convertible into cash since
there is insufficient daily trading volume for the holders to convert the convertible notes into Common Stock without significantly affecting
the share price. Accordingly, the embedded derivatives, including the embedded conversion feature, did not meet the definition of a derivative,
and therefore, did not require bifurcation from the host instrument. Certain default put provisions, including a default put and default
interest, were not considered to be clearly and closely related to the host instrument but the Company concluded that the value of these
provisions was de minimus at inception. The Company will reconsider the value of these provisions each reporting period to determine if
the value becomes material to the financial statements. 

On August 8, 2022, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement for a total of with an accredited investor. The note issued is convertible into common stock at a discount
to the lowest trading price in the 20-day period prior to conversion. The note bears interest at and is due one year from issuance.

Company chose to early adopt effective January 1, 2021, ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and Derivatives and Hedging - Contract in Entity s Own Equity. Thus, the April 2021 and October 2021 Note Purchase Agreements did
not require consideration of a beneficial conversion feature and were accounted for solely as debt on the balance sheets.

on the convertible notes issued April 1, 2021 and October 8, 2021 Tranche 1 Notes from of the price paid in a Qualified
Financing (proceeds of at least million), to the lesser of (x) and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing (proceeds of
at least million). The Amendment Agreement also provides the following Milestone Payments: 

1) 
 
 after filing a premarket notification pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, of its intent to market its
 PRP cellular therapy 

2) 
 Following
 the closing of a Qualified financing, of all proceeds raised in excess of million (not to exceed 1 million) 

The
Milestone Payments are not to exceed 2 million, and the Amendment Agreement also specifies that a Qualified Financing will not occur
prior to the closing of the acquisition of Jantibody, LLC. 

The
Company evaluated the Amendment Agreement under ASC 470-50, Debt - Modification and Extinguishment , and concluded that
probability of having to pay a Milestone payment was minimal and the change in the fair value of the conversion feature was not material.
Since the Amendment did not cause a material change in cash flows, extinguishment accounting was not applicable. 

On
April 29, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Conversion Agreement (the Note Conversion Agreement with certain holders of its Tranche 1 Notes (i) providing for a conversion price equal to the lesser of (x) per share (pre-split)
and (y) the price per share paid by the investors in a Qualified Financing for such New Securities purchased for cash and not through
conversion of Notes (as such terms are defined in the Note Conversion Agreement), in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the
event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization, (ii) automatic conversion upon the occurrence
of a Qualified Financing, and (iii) amendment of the maturity date from March 31, 2022 to June 17, 2022 (the New Notes ).
 per share. The New Notes also provided the investors with Royalty Payments equal to of all net
sales generated by the Company with respect to the sale of products or services associated with the 510(k) Notification related to the
Company s autologous cellular therapy (PRP-PBMC) to treat chronic lung disorder. The Royalty Payments are in lieu of the Milestone
payments but are perpetual and there is no limit to the aggregate amount of Royalty Payments that may be paid. 

Due
to changes in key provisions of the Tranche 1 Notes, the Company analyzed the before and after cash flows between the (i) fair value
of the New Notes and (ii) reacquisition price of the Tranche 1 Notes prior to the (A) change in the maturity date from March 31, 2022
to June 17, 2022, (B) change in the conversion price to the lesser of (x) and (y) the price paid in a Qualified Financing, and
(C) the fair value of the potential Royalty Payments, to determine whether these changes resulted in a modification or extinguishment
of the Tranche 1 Notes. 

The
Company used a discounted cash flow method with Monte Carlo Simulation to value the Royalty Payments. Future Royalty Payments were estimated
based on management s best estimate of future cash flows under various scenarios which were discounted to present value using a
risk-adjusted rate of . 

Based
on the before and after cash flows of each note, the change was considered significantly different. Consequently, the New Notes were
accounted for as a debt extinguishment of the Tranche 1 Notes and a new debt issuance of the New Notes. The Company recorded a million
loss upon extinguishment of debt in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which was comprised of the following: 

Less: Fair value of New Notes 

Less: Fair value of Royalty Payments 

Loss on Extinguishment 

The
Note Conversion Agreement also provided for the consummation of a Tranche 2 Financing (the Tranche 2 Notes subject to
(i) the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness represented by the Tranche 2 Notes being capped at and (ii) Tranche 2 Notes 
being an unsecured obligation of the Company and expressly subordinate in all respects to all indebtedness of the Company under the Notes
and including language in which the holders of such Tranche 2 Notes acknowledge, confirm and agree to the foregoing subordination terms.
Pursuant to the terms of the Note Conversion Agreement, the Investors have agreed not to sell any capital stock of the Company for a
period of 12 months following the Qualified Financing. 

On
June 9, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a total of with two accredited investors. The notes
issued are convertible into common stock at a discount to the lowest trading price in the 20-day period prior to conversion. The
notes bear interest at and are due one year from issuance. 

The
Company also issued a promissory note for , on June 9, 2022, to another accredited investor. 

The
embedded features in the convertible notes were analyzed under ASC 815 to determine if they required bifurcation as derivative instruments.
To be a derivative, one of the criteria is that the embedded component must be net-settleable. While the Company s Common Stock
was traded on an exchange at the time of the transaction, the underlying shares are not readily convertible into cash since there is
insufficient daily trading volume for the holders to convert the convertible notes into Common Stock without significantly affecting the
share price. Accordingly, the embedded derivatives, including the embedded conversion feature, did not meet the definition of a derivative,
and therefore, did not require bifurcation from the host instrument. Certain default put provisions, including a default put and default
interest, were not considered to be clearly and closely related to the host instrument but the Company concluded that the value of these
provisions was de minimus at inception. The Company will reconsider the value of these provisions each reporting period to determine
if the value becomes material to the financial statements. 

The
Company chose to early adopt effective January 1, 2021, ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)
and Derivatives and Hedging - Contract in Entity s Own Equity. Thus, the April 2021 and October 2021 Note Purchase Agreements did
not require consideration of a beneficial conversion feature and were accounted for solely as debt on the balance sheets. 

On
August 9, 2022, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement for a total of with an accredited investor. The note
issued is convertible into common stock at a discount to the lowest trading price in the 20-day period prior to conversion. The note
bears interest at and is due one year from issuance.

Paycheck
Protection Program

ownership interest in Jantibody. 

Pursuant
to the Jantibody Agreement, the Company issued the equity holders of Jantibody an aggregate of shares of the Company s common
stock which represented 15 of the Company s common stock on a fully diluted basis at the time of the transaction. In addition,
for every share of the Company s common stock issued as a result of the future conversion of the Company s dilutive instruments,
including Series A preferred stock, warrants, stock options, and convertible notes, the Jantibody members will receive 15 of the aggregate
number of shares issued (the Anti-Dilution shares). The Anti-Dilution shares will be issued before the end of each fiscal
quarter. 

The
Company has agreed to issue the Jantibody holders an additional 2.0 of the Company s common stock then outstanding upon the enrollment
of the first patient in a Phase I FDA trial and additional 3.0 of the Company s then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted
basis upon the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase [III] FDA trial. The Company determined the contingent consideration was not
subject to derivative accounting and will be recognized when the contingency is resolved, and the consideration is paid or becomes payable
as outlined in ASC 450, Contingencies . 

The
Company determined this transaction represented an asset acquisition as defined by ASC 805, Business Combinations, as substantially
all of the value was in a single in-process research and development IPR D group, which included the small molecule
drug CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, and/or checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) for anti-cancer immune modulation. As a result, the consideration transferred
was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values
resulting in approximately being assigned to the IPR D asset and approximately to assumed liabilities. The
liabilities assumed were current accounts payable and as such were recorded a book value. 

The
purchase price of approximately represented shares of the Company s common stock, Anti-Dilution shares,
and direct transaction costs of . The purchase price was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the acquired intellectual
property, and the acquired net assets as follows: 

Common stock (anti-dilution shares, to be issued included in other current liabilities) 

Direct transaction costs 

Total costs of the asset acquisition 

Assets acquired 

Cash 

Accounts payable assumed legal and administrative costs 

Intangible assets: IPR D 

Net identifiable assets acquired 

The
IPR D had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use; thus, the purchased IPR D asset and related
costs were expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition within the consolidated statements of operations. 

On
December 22, 2022, the Company acquired a interest in Scion Solutions, LLC Scion ). Scion is a life sciences company
that has developed a new technology in regenerative medicine specifically for limb salvage. Their proprietary product SkinDisc (patent
pending) is a combination of stem cells and several other molecular components that stimulate tissue regeneration. Prior to the acquisition, Tanya Rhodes, CSO, had approximately ownership interest in Scion. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Scion Agreement, the Company issued the equity holders of Scion an aggregate of shares of the Company s
common stock. In addition, for every share of the Company s common stock issued within 18-months of the Effective Date of the transaction,
as a result of the future conversion of the Company s dilutive instruments, including Series A preferred stock, warrants, stock
options, and convertible notes, the Scion members will receive 20 of the aggregate number of shares issued (the Anti-Dilution 
shares). The Anti-Dilution shares will be issued before the end of each fiscal quarter. 

In
addition, the former shareholders of Scion are eligible to receive Performance Payments consisting of the following: 

1-Year Anniversary of Uplifting of H-Cyte 

2-Year Anniversary of Uplifting of H-Cyte 

Initiation of SkinDisc Study 

Receipt of De Novo or any other approval/clearance that would allow SkinDisc to go to market 

Submission for specific and individual reimbursement codes relating to SkinDisc 

Receipt of specific and individual reimbursement codes relating to SkinDisc 

Completion of SkinDisc Study 

Launch of any additional SkinDisc product line extension (e.g., SkinDisc Lite) 

Annual net sales from SkinDisc (including SkinDisc extensions) (2023 and each subsequent calendar year) 

Cumulative net sales from SkinDisc (including SkinDisc extensions) of 

Cumulative net sales from SkinDisc (including SkinDisc extension) of 

Cumulative net sales from SkinDisc (including SkinDisc extension) of 

Net sales from SkinDisc (including SkinDisc extensions) of during any single calendar year 

S ubstantially
all of the value acquired was concentrated in a single in-process research and development IPRD asset, which included
license rights, clinical trial data, clinical trial development plans, research and development materials, formulations and intellectual
property related to SkinDisc. There was no workforce, and no outputs were present. Accordingly, the acquired set of assets and activities
did not meet the definition of a business as defined by ASC 805, Business Combinations and
was considered an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, the consideration transferred is allocated to identifiable tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. In the Scion acquisition, the only asset
or liability acquired was IPR D. As a result, the consideration transferred was recorded fully to the IPR D asset. 

In
an asset acquisition, cash-settled contingent consideration is measured when probable and estimable, unless the contingent consideration
falls under the guidance of ASC 815. The Company determined the contingent consideration was not subject to ASC 815 and thus, the performance
payments which were estimable and probable (i.e., more than 50 likely to occur) were recorded on the acquisition date. The fair value
was estimated based on a probability weighting of the present value of cash flows over the expected time period until payment, using
a credit-risk adjusted interest rate. Each reporting period, the Company will determine if the performance payments are estimable and
probable and will record them as a liability at that time. 

The
purchase price was allocated, as follows: 

Anti-Dilution share liability 

Contingent Performance payment liability 

Direct transaction costs 

Total costs of the asset acquisition 

The
common stock value was recorded as equity. The consideration of was recorded as IPR D, since the
SkinDisc technology was still in the research and development stage and had no alternative future use. The purchased IPR D asset
was expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition within our consolidated statements of operations.

The
Company s financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of losses incurred that
are considered start-up costs for tax purposes, as well as net deferred income tax assets resulting from other temporary differences
related to certain reserves and differences between book and tax depreciation and amortization. 

The
Company assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence, including a history of taxable income and
estimates of future taxable income. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely
than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the history of losses incurred by the Company,
management believes it is not more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets can be realized. Accordingly, the Company established
and recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

The
Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, the
end of our fiscal year. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that
disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired objectives, and the Company necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
disclosure controls and procedures. 

The
Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. 

Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
as discussed below, and as a result, the Company engaged consultants to help mitigate these material weaknesses. 

In
light of the conclusion that our internal disclosure controls are classified as ineffective as of December 31, 2022, we have applied
procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting in regard to this annual report. Accordingly,
the Company believes, based on its knowledge, that: (i) this annual report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report; and (ii) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
annual report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the
periods presented in this annual report. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement
of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision of our CEO and CFO, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 32, 2022, using the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO (2013 Framework). 

18 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on
a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, we determined
that control deficiencies existed that constituted material weaknesses as follows: 

an
 ineffective control environment due to an insufficient number of accounting personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge and
 experience, related to some of the Company s more complex accounting transactions and SEC financial reporting, 

ineffective
 control activities and monitoring controls due to the lack of segregation of duties and insufficient analysis of certain accounts. 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses 

Management
is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In response to the identified material weaknesses, management, with
the oversight of the Audit Committee, has taken actions toward the remediation of the respective material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting as outlined below. 

(i)
appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient
written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting (iii) continued education. 

The
remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing
the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. 

Management
believes continuing to use qualified consultants and experts to help with the Company s more complex transactions will help remediate
the material weaknesses described above. The Audit Committee and management will continue to monitor the implementation of these remediation
measures and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by COSO (2013 Framework). 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
controls over financial reporting because this is not required of the Company pursuant to Regulation SK Item 308(b). 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except
as set forth above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December
31, 2022, that materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Equity
Compensation Plan Information 

In
the Merger, the Company assumed 

The
2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan is intended to secure for H-CYTE and its stockholders the benefits arising from ownership
of its Common Stock by individuals the Company employs or retains who will be responsible for the future growth of the enterprise. The
Plan is also designed to help attract and retain superior personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, including advisory relationships
where appropriate, and to provide individuals with an additional incentive to contribute to the Company s success. 

The
 Administrator of the Plan is the CEO; however, the Administrator may also delegate to one or more officers of the Company
the authority to make most determinations otherwise reserved for decision by the Administrator. Under the Plan, the Administrator has
the flexibility to determine eligible participants and the type and amount of awards to grant to eligible participants. 

The
Administrator may make the following types of grants under the Plan, each of which will be an Award : 

qualified
 incentive stock options QISOs 

nonqualified
 stock options; and 

awards
 of restricted stock and/or restricted stock units. 

The
Company s officers, key employees, directors, consultants, and other independent contractors or agents who are responsible for
or contribute to its management, growth or profitability will be eligible for selection by the Administrator to participate in the Plan,
provided, however, that QISOs may be granted only to the Company s employees. 

H-CYTE
authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan an aggregate of 2,650 shares of its Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company
had outstanding an aggregate of 165 options to purchase common stock at a weighted average price of 3,076 per share. The Company
did not grant stock options under the plan in 2022 or 2021. If any of the awards granted under the Plan expire, terminate, or are forfeited
for any reason before they have been exercised, vested, or issued in full, the unused shares allocable to or subject to those expired,
terminated or forfeited awards will become available for further grants under the Plan. 

On
April 1, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a non-qualified stock option agreement and granted an aggregate of 54,750
stock options to certain directors and officers of the Company having an exercise price of 70.00 per share and an expiration date of

ITEM
 13. 
 CERTAIN
 RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Policies
and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 

H-CYTE s
board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement, or relationship in which
the Company is a participant, the amount involved exceeds 120,000 and one of its executive officers, directors, director nominees or
5 stockholders, or their immediate family members, each of whom is referred to as a related person, has a direct or indirect
material interest. 

25 

If
a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which the Company refers to as a related
person transaction, the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to the CEO. The policy calls for the
proposed related person transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by the audit committee. Whenever practicable,
the reporting, review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. 

If
advance review and approval is not practicable, the committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction.
The policy also permits the chairman of the committee to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions
that arise between committee meetings, subject to ratification by the committee at its next meeting. Any related person transactions
that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually. 

A
related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the committee after
full disclosure of the related person s interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the committee will review
and consider: 

the
 related person s interest in the related person transaction; 

the
 approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related person transaction; 

the
 approximate dollar value of the amount of the related person s interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of
 any profit or loss; 

whether
 the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business; 

whether
 the terms of the transaction are no less favorable than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; and 

the
 purpose of, and the potential benefits of, the transaction. 

The
committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if the committee determines that, under all circumstances, the transaction is in
the Company s best interests. The committee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems appropriate. 

In
addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, our
board of directors has determined that the following transactions do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related
persons and, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy: 

interests
 arising solely from the related person s position as an executive officer of another entity (whether or not the person is also
 a director of such entity) that is a participant in the transaction, where (i) the related person and all other related persons own
 in the aggregate less than a 10 equity interest in such entity, (ii) the related person and his or her immediate family members
 are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction
 and (iii) the amount involved in the transaction is less than the greater of 200,000 or 5 of the annual gross revenues of the company
 receiving payment under the transaction; and 

a
 transaction that is specifically contemplated by provisions of the Company s charter or bylaws. 

The
policy provides that transactions involving compensation of executive officers shall be reviewed and approved by the compensation committee
in the manner specified in its charter. 

26 

Stock
Option Grants to Executive Officers and Directors 

H-CYTE
authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan an aggregate of 2,650 shares of Common Stock. The Company did not grant stock
options under the plan in 2021. If any of the Awards granted under the Plan expire, terminate, or are forfeited for any reason before
they have been exercised, vested or issued in full, the unused shares allocable to or subject to those expired, terminated or forfeited
awards will become available for further grants under the Plan. 

On
