DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Arion Group Corp. was incorporated in the State
of Nevada on November 7, 2016 and established a fiscal year end of January 31. We are currently a start-up company exploring various manufacturing
and distribution business opportunities in the dietary ingredient and nutritional supplement industry. On November 1 and November 4, 2022,
the Company entered into an agreement with EZ Field Inc and Alta Health Supplies Inc respectively. The agreements set forth the exclusive
terms and conditions for the Company to acquire and sell health supplements from and to these parties. By November 18, 2022, we expanded
our list of suppliers by entering into an agreement with Bio Essence Health Science to develop cosmetic products and health supplements. 

On November 21, 2018 (the Closing Date ),
a change in control of the Company occurred, pursuant to which Mr. Mingyong Huang acquired a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock (or approximately 65.53 of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of the date of acquisition) from Ms.
Nataliia Kriukova, the previous principal stockholder of the Company. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated November 21, 2018
(the 2018 SPA and other related agreements, Ms. Kriukova resigned from all management and Board positions. The Company
also paid off stockholder loan owed to Ms. Kriukova in the amount of 2,663 with cash and inventory on hand pursuant to the 2018 SPA on
November 21, 2018. 

On May 5, 2020, Mr. Hui Song, a former member
of the Board of Directors of the Company, resigned as a director. On June 3, 2020, Mr. Mingyong Huang entered into another Stock Purchase
Agreement (the 2020 SPA ), pursuant to which Mr. Huang sold all of his 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock
to Mr. Jay Hamilton, who becomes the Company s majority and controlling stockholder. On June 4, 2020, Ms. Maria Itzel Torres Siegrist
resigned as Secretary of the Company. In connection with the change of control as of June 17, 2020 the Board appointed Mr. Hamilton to
the Company s Board of Directors. Also, as of June 17, 2020, the Board appointed Mr. Hamilton as President/CEO and Ms. Brenda Bin
Wang as CFO and Mr. Huang as Secretary. Mr. Huang remains a director of the Company. 

Prior to November 21, 2018, we distributed an
assortment of cedar phyto barrels in the USA and Europe. Our products were offered at prices marked-up from 80 to 100 of our cost. Our
customers were asked to pay us 100 in advance. We filled placed orders and supplied the products within a period of thirty days (30)
days or less following receipt of any written order. Customers were responsible for the custom duties, taxes, insurance or any other additional
charges that might incur. The business of distribution of cedar phyto barrels was discontinued after November 21, 2018. 

Since the change of control on November 21, 2018,
we have changed our business plan to focus on medical health care industry, including consulting services provided to third parties
for planning, design and compliance of cannabis cultivation in the USA. On November 18, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Bio Essence
Health Science and EZ Field Inc to develop cosmetic products and health supplements. We also established distribution channels through
Alta Health Supplies Inc, Tak Ye International Inc and Xin Shi Dai Express. We have generated 20,818 of sales from distribution services
since the inception of this business plan.

notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ),

There is no established trading market due to limited and

PENNY STOCK CONSIDERATIONS 

The trading of our common stock is deemed to be
 penny stock as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price
of less than 5.00. Our shares thus are subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who
engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock. 

Under the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer
selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination
regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer
is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 100,000 individually
or 300,000 together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer
is required to: 

Deliver, prior to any transaction
involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the
transaction is otherwise exempt; 

Disclose commissions payable
to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities; 

Send monthly statements disclosing
recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer s account, the account s value and information
regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and 

Make a special written determination
that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction,
prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer s account. 

Because of these regulations, broker-dealers may
encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders
or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary
market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock in the market place. In
addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our shares
are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

3 

STOCKHOLDERS 

As of the date of this Report, we had approximately
37 stockholders of record of our common stock. This figure does not include holders of shares registered in street name 
or persons, partnerships, associates, corporations or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories. 

DIVIDENDS 

We have never paid or declared any dividends on
our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY
COMPENSATION PLANS 

We currently do not have any equity compensation
plans. 

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]. 

Not Applicable. 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from
those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not
limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

As of January 31, 2023, we had total assets of
 33,902 and total liabilities of 259,784. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

We discontinued our cedar phyto barrels distribution
business upon the change in control occurred on November 21, 2018 and started to implement a new business plan to pursue business opportunities
in manufacturing and distribution of certain dietary ingredient and nutritional supplement products. On November 18, 2022, we entered
into an agreement with Bio Essence Health Science and EZ Field Inc to develop cosmetic products and health supplements. We also established
distribution channels through Alta Health Supplies Inc, Tak Ye International Inc and Xin Shi Dai Express. We have generated 20,818 of
sales from distribution services since the inception of this business plan. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was
 81,923, as compared to a net loss of 72,630 during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. 

Year ended January 31, 2023 compared to
the year ended January 31, 2022 

Revenue 

During the year ended January 31, 2023, the Company
generated 20,818 of sales from the sale of health supplements distributed through Alta Health Supplies Inc. During the year ended
January 31, 2022, the Company neither sold any product nor generated any revenue. 

4 

Operating Expenses 

During the year ended January 31, 2023, we incurred
total general and administrative expenses of 89,228 which is an increase for 17,398 compared to 71,830 for the year ended January 31,
2022. General and administrative expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services,
such as legal and accounting and various compliance costs. 

Our net loss for the year ended January 31, 2023
was 81,923, compared to net loss of 72,630 for the year ended January 31, 2022. The increase in net loss in the year ended January 31,
2022 in the amount of 9,293 represents a 12.79 increase over the net loss in the previous year. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. While the Company has started a new business plan, the Company has
not generated sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. 

Our independent auditor s report accompanying
our January 31, 2023 and 2022 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, 
which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. This
assumption may, however, not hold true for a variety of reasons, many of which are out of our control. 

As of January 31, 2023 our current assets were
 33,624 compared to 3,863 in current assets at January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, our total assets were 33,902 compared to 4,141
in total assets at January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, our current liabilities were 259,784, or an increase in the amount of 111,684
(or 75.41 compared to 148,100 as of January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2023, we had loan from stockholder in the total amount of 259,784,
or 100 of our total liabilities, as we have not been able to generate a steady cash flow to cover our operating expenses and have to
rely heavily on the financial support from our stockholder. 

Total stockholders deficit was 225,882
as of January 31, 2023, compared to 143,959 as of January 31, 2022, representing an increase in the amount of 81,923. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

For the year ended January 31, 2023, net cash
used by operating activities was 96,816, consisting of net loss of 81,923, an increase in advance to supplier of 4,794, a decrease
in accounts payable of 2,599, an increase of 4,500 in accrued expense and an increase in 3,000 in security deposit. 

For the year ended January 31, 2022, net cash
used by operating activities was 77,031, consisting of net loss of 72,630, and a decrease in accounts payable of 4,401. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Cash flows used in investing activities during
years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were 0 and 0, respectively. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash flows provided by financing activities during
the year ended January 31, 2023 was 114,500. We borrowed a total of 114,500 loan from our major stockholder for general business operations. 

Cash flows provided by financing activities during
the year ended January 31, 2022 was 61,000. We borrowed a total of 61,000 loan from our major stockholder for general business operations. 

5 

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We have no lines of credit or other bank financing
arrangements. Currently we are financed by our major stockholder. Our working capital requirements for the next 12 months are expected
to increase if and when we are able to execute on our current business plan. As of January 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit
in the amount of 226,160. 

We also intend to finance our operating expenses
and business development costs with further issuances of securities and debt issuances. Additional issuances of equity or convertible
debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any material commitments. 

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 

We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment
during the next twelve months. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus entitled
COVID-19 emerged in China and spread to other countries including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
COVID-19 to be a public health pandemic of international concern, which has resulted in travel restrictions and in some cases, prohibitions
of non-essential activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. 

In the United States in which we and our customers,
and partners operate, the health concerns as well as political or governmental developments in response to COVID-19 could result in economic,
social or labor instability or prolonged contractions in certain end markets. These events could have a material adverse effect on the
business and results of operations and financial condition. 

At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent
to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business or operating results, which is highly dependent on uncertain future developments,
including the severity of the pandemic and the actions taken or to be taken by governments and private businesses in relation to its containment.
The Company s plan pf conducting new businesses might be delayed and the effect of the outbreak may not be fully reflected in our
operating results until future periods. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

Arion Group Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Arion Group Corp. (the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes
in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines
internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions; 

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of January 31, 2023. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because
of the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which are described below.

Management s Reports on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on
this evaluation, management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2023.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. 

We had the following material weaknesses at January
31, 2023: 

We have a lack of proper segregation of duties. Management is dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls. 

Our internal control structure lacks multiple levels of review and oversight. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not
subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
