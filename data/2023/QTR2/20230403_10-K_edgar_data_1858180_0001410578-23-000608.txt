Our efforts to identify a potential target has not been limited to a particular industry.

We will not undertake our initial business combination with an entity being based in or having the majority of the company s operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Our ability to locate a potential target is subject to the uncertainties discussed in the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.: 333-262457) (the S-1 ), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

 Background of Business Combination The terms of the Business Combination are the result of arms-length negotiations between us and noco-noco, and the respective representatives. The following is a brief description of the background of these negotiations. Between May 17, 2022 and the date hereof, we reviewed in varying degrees approximately five potential business combination candidates involved in various industries and sectors, including construction and infrastructure, manufacturing, high technology, ad fintech. Our management team held frequent discussions regarding these targets both internally and with a wide range of the potential business combination candidates management teams. For the four potential candidates that we did not proceed with the definitive transaction documents, we signed non-disclosure agreement with two targets, and non-binding term sheet with each of two other targets. Timeline of Business Combination On June 1, 2022, Mr. Weixiong (Jeff) Cheong met with Singapore management team of noco-noco including Mr. Masataka Matsumura. Management of noco-noco shared introduction of noco-noco s business and the industry, and invited Mr. Cheong to visit 3DOM Alliance s facilities in Japan. On June 9, Mr. Cheong travelled to Japan and had an on-site visit with 3DOM Alliance, the controlling shareholder of noco-noco, accompanied by management of noco-noco. During the visit, Mr. Cheong had conversations with noco-noco management team and 3DOM Alliance over topics including noco-noco s business operation, business plan analyses, and potential for business combination. To respond to questions in greater details, noco-noco management proposed a non-binding LOI with us, in which there shall be confidentiality clause. Following Mr. Cheong s visit to Japan, our management agreed to further pursue the opportunity with noco-noco. On June 15, 2022, representatives of noco-noco and our management had meeting to discuss preliminarily on entering into a non-binding letter of intent. On July 1, 2022, we sent a draft non-binding term sheet to noco-noco which was primarily for the demonstration purpose to show the material terms to be included in the term sheet. The draft included, among others, the following terms:(i) the parties shall contemplate a business combination, and the deal structure will be determined based on due diligence findings and other considerations; and (ii) the total transaction consideration will be based on noco-noco s equity value estimated at 2.5 billion, the desired valuation by noco-noco. The parties also agreed to further discuss valuation and other terms. On July 11, 2022, in order to obtain additional information of noco-noco and allow some time for the parties to negotiate substantive terms of a business combination, we and noco-noco reached a non-binding letter of intent (the noco-noco LOI which contemplated the following major terms: (i) the noco-noco LOI is intended to express only a mutual indication of interest in a potential business combination and shall not create legal obligation to the parties, except for certain binding matters; (ii) the parties agree to discuss in good faith and make reasonable good faith efforts to agree in writing, non-binding, material terms of the potential business combination within 45 business days after date of the noco-noco LOI, and such agreement in writing shall be appended to and supplement the noco-noco LOI (the Term Sheet (iii) noco-noco shall not, at any time, have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in any monies in the Trust Account.; (iv) each party shall keep confidential of information disclosed by the other party; and (v) until termination of the noco-noco LOI, noco-noco may not engage in transaction that would prohibit or impair the proposed business combination. Following execution of the noco-noco LOI, noco-noco started sharing diligence materials to us, including but not limited to documents in relation to business planning, and existing collaboration letters of intent or transaction indications. From July 11, 2022 to August 5, 2022, we and noco-noco had extensive discussions and negotiations over the proposed Term Sheet. The negotiation was mainly focused on valuation of noco-noco s business. Pursuant to negotiation, we and noco-noco agreed on valuation range of 1.25 billion to 2.5 billion. On August 5, 2022, the parties executed the Term Sheet.

 Agreements with Advisors On October 25, 2022, we engaged PNCPS and WestPark, the representatives of the underwriters for our IPO, to act as the financial advisors to us in connection with its initial business combination. Pursuant to their engagement letter, PNCPS and WestPark have agreed, if requested by and in consultation with us, among others, to assist us in the transaction structing and negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement with respect to a business combination, hold meetings with us stockholders to discussion business combination and the target s attributes, introduce us to potential investors in connection with a business combination, assist us with relevant financial analysis, presentations, press releases. PNCPS and Westpark will not receive any additional compensation for services rendered under this engagement except the deferred underwriting fee in the amount of 2,257,500 as provided in a certain underwriting agreement dated May 12, 2022 among us, PNCPS and Westpark. We also agrees to reimburse PNCPS and WestPark up to 20,000 for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their services thereunder. On October 25, 2022, we and PNCPS entered into a separate engagement whereby PNCPS would, among others, use its reasonable efforts in identifying and introducing potential targets, valuate potential business combination and assess the proposed structure for business combination and assist in managing the process and other related services. In exchange of its services, we have agreed to pay or cause the surviving entity to pay a service fee equal to 0.5 of the total value of all cash, securities, or other property paid or transferred at the closing by or to us, the target and/or their shareholders with respect to a business combination. On January 31, 2023, we and PNCPS amended the original engagement to set forth PNCPS s compensation thereunder in connection with the Business Combination, which includes 500,000 in cash and 609,756 newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares, payable at the Closing. In addition, we also agree to reimburse PNCPS up to 5,000 for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in rendering their services. Effecting the Business Combination Business Our business strategy is to identify and acquire potential targets in which we believe can materially grow revenue and earnings through the efforts of a combined management team followed by the completion of a Business Combination, but we will not undertake our initial business combination with an entity being based in or having the majority of the company s operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Initial Business Combination Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the assets held in the Trust Account (defined below) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions payable to our underwriters and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial business combination, but we will not undertake our initial business combination with an entity being based in or having the majority of the company s operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. The Trust Funds released to us from the Trust Account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our Public Shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following consummation of this offering. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our founders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination, except that our Sponsor

 A has committed to transfer up to 465,000 Founder Shares (as defined below) to financial advisors, finders or consultants in our Business Combination who are not affiliated with us and our founders. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, following this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we are prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote as a class with our Public Shares (a) on any initial business combination, or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a Business Combination beyond May 17, 2023 (12 months from the closing of the IPO) (or up to November 17, 2023 (18 months from the closing of the IPO) if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) or (y) amend the foregoing provisions, unless (in connection with any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) we offer our public stockholders the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of PNAC s directors results in conflicts of interest on the part of such director(s) between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of PNAC and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the Proposals. In addition, PNAC s officers have interests in the Business Combination that may conflict with your interests as a shareholder. For more information on the foregoing conflicts of interest and the relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our management team, see the section titled Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Conflicts of Interest . Status as a Public Company We believe our structure will make us an attractive Business Combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other Business Combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a Business Combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed Business Combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million

 as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Financial Position With funds in the Trust Account available for a Business Combination initially in the amount of 63,532,500, after payment of 2,257,500 for the deferred underwriting compensation and compensation for PNCPS services as M A advisor, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. Lack of Business Diversification For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete Business Combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
 Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Business Combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. Following a Business Combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our The Business Combination We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Whether Stockholder Approval is Type of Transaction Required Purchase of assets No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company No Merger of the company with a target Yes Under Nasdaq s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: we issue shares of Common Stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Common Stock then outstanding; any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of Common Stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or the issuance or potential issuance of Common Stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
 The decision as to whether we will seek stockholders approval of a proposed Business Combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; (ii) the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; (iii) the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed Business Combination; (iv) other time and budget constraints of the company; and (v) additional legal complexities of a proposed Business Combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. Permitted Purchases of our Securities In the event we seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our founders, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our founders or advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

Table of Contents 
 The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Business Combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Common Stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Our founders or advisors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our founders, advisors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our founders, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against the Business Combination. Our founders, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any purchases by our founders, advisors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our founders, advisors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of Common Stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of the Business Combination We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Common Stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be approximately 10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting compensation. Our founders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Private Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Business Combination. However, if our founders acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). PubCo has filed a draft of a registration statement in Form F-4 which contains proxy materials to our stockholders to seek their approval of the Business Combination, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. We will complete our Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. A quorum for the special meeting for such a vote will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our founders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, Private Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. Our founders collectively own 2,011,392 shares of Common Stock (including 1,612,500 Founder Shares and 398,892 Private Shares). As a result, in addition to our founders Founder Shares and Private Shares, we would need 2,219,305 shares (or 34.41 of the 6,450,000 Public Shares sold in the IPO) in order to have our Business Combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares voted); or 103,957 shares (1.61 of the 6,450,000 Public Shares sold in the IPO) in order to have our Business Combination approved (assuming only the quorum is present and voted). We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our Business Combination.

 These quorums and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our founders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote, do not vote or abstain, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination, and irrespective of whether they were a public stockholder on the record date for the general meeting held to approve the Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Common Stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Common Stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Initial Business Combination Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20 of the shares sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20 of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 20 of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not restrict our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against, or to abstain from voting on, our Business Combination. Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Business Combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.

 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their Business Combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed Business Combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the Business Combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the Business Combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the Business Combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the Business Combination is approved. Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Business Combination. If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a Business Combination with a different target by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only 18 months from the closing of the IPO to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or Up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). Our founders have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares and Private Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). However, if our founders acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). Our founders have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us (filed as an exhibit hereto), that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), or (ii) with respect to any other material provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination

 activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we will only redeem our Public Shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of Public Shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above) we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our Public Shares. We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately 700,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Shares, other than the Trust Funds, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.20. The Trust Funds could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.20. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims We have not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your Public Shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

 In the event that the Trust Funds are reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and the Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against the Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.20 per public share. We will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsors will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. the Sponsors will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately 700,000 from the proceeds of the IPO with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors. Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our Public Shares in the event we do not complete our Business Combination within by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital purposes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18 th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation

 contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, the Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the Trust Funds could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our Public Shares if we do not complete our Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), subject to applicable law, (ii) (a) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our Public Shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Public Shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in the S-1. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. Facilities Our executive offices are located at 1129 Northern Blvd., Suite 404, Manhasset, New York 11030.

 Employees We currently have three executive officers including Mr. Dongfeng Wang, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Weixiong (Jeff) Cheong, the Chief Operating Officer, and Mr. David Friedman, the Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Periodic Reporting and Financial Information We have registered our Units, Class A Common Stock, Warrants and Rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Business Combination. We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Legal Proceedings There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Annual Report are any of the risks described in the prospectus of our IPO (File No. 333-262457) filed with the SEC on May 16, 2022 (the Prospectus and in a proxy statement/prospectus in connection with the Business Combination on the Form F-4 to be filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Annual Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Prospectus, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operations. We maintain our principal executive offices at 1129 Northern Blvd., Suite 404, Manhasset, New York 11030. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding, investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our Units began to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol PNACU on May 13, 2022. The Class A Common Stock, Warrants and Rights comprising the Units began separate trading on Nasdaq on May 13, 2022, under the symbols PNAC , PNACW and PNACR , respectively. Holders of Record At March 13, 2023, there were 11 holders of record of our Class A Common Stock, 1 holder of record of our Units, 1 holder of record of our separately traded Warrants, and 1 holder of record of our separately traded Rights. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends on our shares of Class A Common Stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans None. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the Private Placement of 3,988,920 shares of Private Shares, including 398,892 shares to the Company s Sponsors, including 349,032 shares to Sponsor A and 49,860 shares to Sponsor B, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Share, generating gross proceeds of 3,988,920 (including 3,490,320 from Sponsor A and 498,600 from Sponsor B). The Private Shares are identical to the shares of Class A Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except that the Private Shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to our founders, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.

 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers None. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on February 25, 2021 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of Class A common stock (the Private Placement Shares in a private placement (the Private Placement to the Company s sponsors, potential additional shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. On May 17, 2022, the Company consummated the IPO of 6,450,000 units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock, 0.0001 par value per share, one-half of one redeemable warrant, and one right. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the Private Placement of 398,892 shares of Private Placement Shares. Following the closings of the IPO and the Private Placement on May 17, 2022, a total of 65,790,000 (or 10.20 per share) was placed in a trust account, established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders and the underwriters of the IPO with Wilmington Trust, National Association acting as trustee (the Trust Account ). Recent Developments On December 29, 2022, we, Prime Number Merger Sub Inc. Merger Sub ), a Delaware corporation established for the purpose to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of a newly incorporated exempted Cayman Islands company PubCo prior to the noco-noco Business Combination (as defined below), NOCO-NOCO PTE. LTD. noco-noco and certain shareholders of noco-noco collectively holding a controlling interest (together with other shareholders of noco-noco subsequently joining the transactions, the Sellers entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the Business Combination Agreement ). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the definitions assigned to such terms in the Business Combination Agreement. Prime Number Holding Limited, formed on December 28, 2022 as PubCo, and Prime Number New Sub Pte. Ltd., formed on January 25, 2023 as New SubCo, joined as parties to such Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the DGCL ), Merger Sub will merge with and into PNAC (the Merger ), with PNAC surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo. The Merger will become effective at such time on the date of the closing of the Merger (the Merger Closing as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time specified in the certificates of merger (the Merger Effective Time ). In addition, a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo to be incorporated in Singapore New SubCo shall acquire the issued and outstanding shares of noco-noco from the Sellers; in exchange, PubCo shall issue to the shareholders of noco-noco the shares of PubCo (the Share Exchange , and together with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the noco-noco Business Combination ), with noco-noco becoming a subsidiary of New SubCo. Upon the consummation of the noco-noco Business Combination, PNAC will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PubCo and noco-noco will be a subsidiary of PubCo with PubCo indirectly holding all or controlling equity interest in noco-noco, and the stockholders of PNAC and the Sellers would receive shares, par value 0.0001 per share, of PubCo PubCo Ordinary

 Shares as consideration and become the shareholders of PubCo. Following the Merger Effective Time, PubCo will change its name to noco-noco Inc. PubCo and New SubCo were incorporated shortly after the execution of the Buiness Combination Agreement and have joined as parties to such Business Combination Agreement. We currently have until May 17, 2023 to consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by May 17, 2023, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination for up to two times by an additional three-month period each time and may have until up to November 17, 2023 to consummate our initial business combination. Results of Operations Our entire activity from inception up to date was related to the Company s formation, the IPO and general and administrative activities. Since the IPO, our activity has been limited to the evaluation of Business Combination candidates, and we will not be generating any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments. We are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income of 141,931, which consisted of general and administrative expenses of 588,973, franchise tax of 47,980, income tax of 112,446 and deferred income taxes provision of 37,190, offset by unrealized gain on investments held in Trust Account of 215,965, and interest earned on the investments held in the Trust Account of 712,555. For the period from February 25, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 1,357, all of which consisted of formation and operating costs. Liquidity and Going Concern On May 17, 2022, we consummated the IPO of 6,450,000 Public Units at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 64,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the Private Placement of 398,892 shares (including 349,032 shares to sponsor A, and 49,860 shares to sponsor B) at a price of 10.00 per share generating gross proceeds of 3,988,920. Following the closings of the IPO and the Private Placement on May 17, 2022, a total of 65,790,000 (or 10.20 per share) was placed in the Trust Account. As of December 31, 2022, we had marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 66,718,520 consisting of securities held in money market funds that invests in United States government treasury bills, bonds or notes with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Account to pay our taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a Business Combination, the remaining funds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our Business Combination if the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of 278,295 and a working capital of 313,675 (excluding investments held in Trust Account, deferred underwriting fee payable and taxes payable). The Company s liquidity needs up to the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2022 had been satisfied through proceeds from notes payable and advances from related party and from the issuance of common stock. We have 12 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with working capital.

 The Company s management plans to continue its efforts to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period after the closing of the IPO. If the estimated costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to its Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, management has determined that mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arraignments We have no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2022, we do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. On October 25, 2022, we engaged PNCPS and WestPark, the representatives of the underwriters for our IPO, to act as the financial advisors to us in connection with its initial business combination. Pursuant to their engagement letter, PNCPS and WestPark have agreed, if requested by and in consultation with us, among others, to assist us in the transaction structing and negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement with respect to a business combination, hold meetings with us stockholders to discussion business combination and the target s attributes, introduce us to potential investors in connection with a business combination, assist us with relevant financial analysis, presentations, press releases. PNCPS and Westpark will not receive any additional compensation for services rendered under this engagement except the deferred underwriting fee in the amount of 2,257,500 as provided in a certain underwriting agreement dated May 12, 2022 among us, PNCPS and Westpark. We also agree to reimburse PNCPS and WestPark up to 20,000 for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their services thereunder. On October 25, 2022, we and PNCPS entered into a separate engagement whereby PNCPS would, among others, use its reasonable efforts in identifying and introducing potential targets, valuate potential business combination and assess the proposed structure for business combination and assist in managing the process and other related services. In exchange of its services, we have agreed to pay or cause the surviving entity to pay a service fee equal to 0.5 of the total value of all cash, securities, or other property paid or transferred at the closing by or to us, the target and/or their shareholders with respect to a business combination. On January 31, 2023, we and PNCPS amended the original engagement to set forth PNCPS s compensation thereunder in connection with the Business Combination, which includes 500,000 in cash and 609,756 newly issued PubCo Ordinary Shares, payable at the Closing. In addition, we also agree to reimburse PNCPS up to 5,000 for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in rendering their services. Pursuant to these arrangements, we are obligated to pay the Representatives the deferred underwriting compensation equal to 3.5 of the IPO Proceeds. The deferred underwriting compensation will become payable to the Representatives from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination. In addition, in connection with and upon the closing of the Business Combination, we will pay or cause the surviving entity of the Business Combination to pay PNCPS 500,000 in cash and issue 609,756 in new PubCo Ordinary Shares.

 Critical Accounting Policies Offering Costs The Company complies with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 340-10-S99-1, Other Assets and Deferred Costs SEC Materials ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A, Expenses of Offering . Offering costs consisting principally of underwriting, legal, accounting and other expenses that are directly related to the IPO and charged to shareholders equity upon the completion of the IPO. Warrants We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own Class A Common Stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of our control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. We determined that upon further review of the proposed form of warrant agreement, management concluded that the warrants included in the units issued in the IPO pursuant to the warrant agreement qualify for equity accounting treatment. Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A Common Stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A Common Stock (including Class A Common Stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A Common Stock are classified as stockholders equity. Our Public Shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, shares of Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value of 10.34 per share as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Class A Common Stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of shares of redeemable Class A Common Stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. Net Income (Loss) per Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. In order to determine the net income (loss) attributable to both the redeemable shares and non-redeemable shares, we first considered the undistributed income (loss) allocable to both the redeemable Class A Common Stock and non-redeemable Class A Common Sock and the undistributed income (loss) is calculated using the total net loss less any dividends paid. We then allocated the undistributed income (loss) ratably based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding between the redeemable and non-redeemable Class A Common Stock. Any remeasurement of the accretion to redemption value of the Class A Common Stock subject to possible redemption was considered to be dividends paid to the public stockholders.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020 06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470 20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40) ASU 2020 06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020 06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020 06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020 06 is effective January 1, 2024 for the Company and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020 06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our financial statements and the notes thereto begin on page F-1 of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Table of Contents 
 their collective access to acquisition opportunities and ideas, their contacts, and their transaction expertise should enable them to identify successfully and effect an acquisition transaction, although we cannot assure you that they will, in fact, be able to do so. Director Independence NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent as long as we are not a controlled company. An independent director is defined under the Nasdaq rules generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that each of Ms. Wang, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Dunn is an independent director as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Audit Committee Since our IPO, we have an audit committee of the board of directors. Ms. Wang, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Dunn serve as members of our audit committee. Mr. Sherman serves as chairman of the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee all of whom must be independent. Ms. Wang, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Dunn are independent. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Sherman qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence; setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors; setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent auditors describing (1) the independent auditor s internal quality-control procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within, the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues; reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory, or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

 Compensation Committee Since our IPO, we have a compensation committee of the board of directors. The members of our Compensation Committee are Ms. Wang, Mr. Sherman and Mr. Dunn. Ms. Wang serves as chairwoman of the compensation committee. We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives, and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer s based on such evaluation in executive session at which the Chief Executive Officer is not present; reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers; reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans; implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; approving all special perquisites, special cash payments, and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees; producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and reviewing, evaluating, and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than reimbursement of expenses and the business combination fee that we have agreed to pay to the Representatives, in connection with our business combination, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to complete the consummation of a business combination although we may consider cash or other compensation to officers or advisors we may hire subsequent to the IPO to be paid either prior to or in connection with our initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. The current charter of the Compensation Committee also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain, or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any such adviser. Before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel, or any other adviser, however, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. Director Nominations We do not have a standing nominating committee. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.

Table of Contents 
 We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, our board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Code of Ethics We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. Conflicts of Interest Although we do not believe any conflict currently exists between us and the founders, affiliates of our founders may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If such entities decide to pursue an opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunity. In addition, investment ideas generated within our founders may be suitable for both of us and for an affiliate of founders and may be directed to such entity rather than to us. Neither our founders nor members of our management team who are also employed by or affiliated with our founders will have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential Business Combination of which they become aware, unless presented to such member specifically in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the company. Our founders and/or our management team, in their capacities as employees or affiliates of our founders or in their other endeavors, may be required to present potential Business Combinations to future founders affiliates or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present Business Combination opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, in the future, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers arising in the future would materially undermine our ability to complete our Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. Our officers or directors may become an officer or director of any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, even before we enter into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination). When considering the PNAC Board s recommendation to vote in favor of approving the Proposals, PNAC stockholders should keep in mind that the Sponsors and PNAC s directors and executive officers, have interests in such proposals that are different from, or in addition to (and which may conflict with), those of PNAC stockholders generally. These interests include, among other things, the interests listed below: the fact that the PNAC Initial Stockholders (including the Sponsors, certain PNAC officers and directors) have agreed not to redeem any PNAC Founder Shares and PNAC Private Shares held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the proposed Business Combination; the fact that the PNAC Initial Stockholders paid an aggregate of 25,000 for the 1,612,500 shares of PNAC Founder Shares and such securities are expected to have a significantly higher value after the Business Combination. As of March 31, 2023, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this report, the aggregate market value of these PNAC Founder Shares, if unrestricted and freely tradable, would be 16,721,625, based upon a closing price of 10.37 per public share on Nasdaq (and will have zero value if neither this Business Combination nor any other business combination is completed on or before the Final Redemption Date); 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 the fact that the Sponsors paid 3,988,920 to purchase an aggregate of 398,892 PNAC Private Shares at a price of 10.00 per share. The PNAC Private Shares would become worthless if a Business Combination is not consummated by the Final Redemption Date. As of March 31, 2023, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this report, the aggregate market value of these PNAC Private Shares, if unrestricted and freely tradable, would be 4,136,510, based upon a closing price of 10.37 per public share on Nasdaq (and will have zero value if neither this Business Combination nor any other business combination is completed on or before the Final Redemption Date); the fact that given the very low purchase price (of 25,000 in aggregate) that the PNAC Initial Stockholders paid for the PNAC Founder Shares as compared to the price of the PNAC Common Stock sold in PNAC IPO, the PNAC Initial Stockholders may earn a positive rate of return on their investment even if the PubCo Ordinary Shares trade below the price initially paid for the PNAC Common Stock in the PNAC IPO and the PNAC Public Stockholder may experience a negative rate of return following the completion of the Business Combination; the fact that the PNAC Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any PNAC Founder Shares and PNAC Private Shares held by them if PNAC fails to complete an initial business combination by the Final Redemption Date. As a result of waiving liquidating distributions, if PNAC fails to complete an initial business combination by the Final Redemption Date, the Sponsors would lose 3,988,920 for the purchase of PNAC Private Shares, and the PNAC Initial Stockholders would lose 25,000 for the purchase of the PNAC Founder Shares, and thus they (other than the PNAC Initial Stockholders that acquired the PNAC Founder Shares from Sponsor A for nominal consideration) would incur substantial loss of investment and will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses; the fact that pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the PNAC Initial Stockholders can demand that PubCo register its registrable securities under certain circumstances and will also have piggyback registration rights for these securities in connection with certain registrations of securities that PubCo undertakes; the continued indemnification of PNAC s directors and officers and the continuation of PNAC s directors and officers liability insurance after the Business Combination (i.e. a tail policy the fact that if the Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event PNAC is unable to complete an initial business combination by the Final Redemption Date, the Sponsors have agreed to indemnify PNAC to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below 10.20 per public share, or such lesser per public share amount as is in the Trust Account on the liquidation date, by the claims of prospective target businesses with which PNAC has entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or a business combination agreement or claims of any third party for services rendered or products sold to PNAC, but only if such a vendor or target business has not executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account; and the fact that the PNAC Initial Stockholders, are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business to PNAC. The PNAC Initial Stockholders are not prohibited from sponsoring, or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies prior to completing the Business Combination. Accordingly, if any of PNAC s officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under DGCL. 
 In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our stockholders for a vote, our founders have agreed to vote any Founder Shares and Private Shares held by them and any Public Shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any Public Shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our shares of Common Stock and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons.

Table of Contents 
 Based solely upon a review of such forms furnished to us during the most recent fiscal year, or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that that all such forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely filed by the officers, directors, and security holders required to file the same during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, other than a Form 3 for Mr. Weixiong (Jeff) Cheong, the Chief Operating Officer, was filed late. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Employment Agreements We have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment. Executive Officers and Director Compensation None of our officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us, except that our Sponsor A has transferred an aggregated amount of 138,500 Founder Shares to our officers, directors, secretary and a member of Sponsor A and their designees prior to the closing of the IPO, among which, (i) 45,000 Founder Shares were transferred to Mr. Dongfeng Wang, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, (ii) 30,000 Founder Shares were transferred to Mr. David Friedman, our Chief Financial Officer and a director, (iii) each 15,000 Founder Shares were transferred to Ms. Qinyu Wang, Mr. H. David Sherman, and Mr. Chris Dunn, our independent directors, (iv) 15,000 Founder Shares to Ms. Sarah Gu, our secretary and (v) 3,500 Founder Shares to Mr. Kris Yang, a member of Sponsor A. In addition, our Sponsor A has agreed to reserve up to 465,000 Founder Shares to be transferred to financial advisors, finders or consultants in connection with our Business Combination who are not affiliated with us and our founders. Other than as set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid to our founders or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination although we may consider cash or other compensation to officers or advisors we may hire subsequent to this offering to be paid either prior to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, our officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our founders or their affiliates. After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed Business Combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed Business Combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. Following a Business Combination, to the extent we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of the date of this annual report, by: each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the shares of our outstanding Common Stock; each of our officers and directors; and all of our officers and directors as a group.

Sponsor A also has agreed to reserve up to 465,000 Founder Shares to be transferred to financial advisors, finders or consultants in connection with our Business Combination. 
 The Founder Shares and Private Shares are subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in a letter agreement with us entered into by our founders. Those lock-up provisions provide that such securities are not transferable or salable (i) in the case of the Founder Shares, 50 of Founder Shares may not be transferred, assigned or sold until the earlier to occur of: (a) six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or (b) the date on which the closing price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds 12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business combination and the remaining 50 of the Founder Shares may

 not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, and (ii) in the case of the Private Shares, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except in each case (a) to our founders, any affiliates or family members of any of our founders, direct and indirect equity holders, (b) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of the individual s immediate family, to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the individual s immediate family or an affiliate of such person, or to a charitable organization; (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination at prices no greater than the price at which the securities were originally purchased; (f) in the event of our liquidation prior to the completion of our initial business combination; or (g) by virtue of the laws of Delaware or our founders limited liability company agreement upon dissolution of our founders, provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (e), or (g) these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founders or an affiliate of our founders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no Trust Funds would be used for such repayment. Up to 3,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into Private Shares at 10.00 per share at the option of the lender. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founders or an affiliate of our founders as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in the Trust Account. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE Founder and Private Shares On April 7, 2021, Sponsor A and Sponsor B acquired 1,357,000 shares and 80,500 shares of Class B common stock, respectively. On May 28, 2021, Sponsor A and Sponsor B surrendered 271,400 and 16,100 shares of Class B common stock, respectively, without consideration. On December 22, 2021, the Company effected a 1.5 for 1 stock split of Class B common stock resulting the Sponsors holding 1,725,000 shares of Class B common stock. On December 28, 2021, the Sponsors converted their shares of Class B common stock into 1,725,000 shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (up to 225,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part). As a result, Sponsor A owns 1,628,400 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate consideration of 23,600 and Sponsor B owns 96,600 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate consideration of 1,400 (collectively Founder Shares for an aggregate consideration of 25,000, or approximately 0.01 per share. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option on May 17, 2022, 112,500 Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture. On June 3, 2022, the Sponsors executed cancellation notices to the transfer agent to forfeit the remaining 112,500 shares for no consideration. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2022, our Sponsor A transferred an aggregated amount of 138,500 Founder Shares to our officers, directors, secretary and a member of Sponsor A or their designees immediately prior to the consummation of this offering at the original purchase price among which, 45,000 Founder Shares to Mr. Dongfeng Wang, our CEO and Chairman, 30,000 Founder Shares to Mr. David Friedman, our CFO and director, 15,000 Founder Shares to each of our independent directors and secretary, and 3,500 Founder Shares to Mr. Kris Yang, a member of our Sponsor A. Sponsor A also has agreed to reserve up to 465,000 Founder Shares to be transferred to financial advisors, finders or consultants in connection with our Business Combination. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company sold an aggregate of 398,892 Private Shares, including 349,032 shares to Sponsor A and 49,860 shares to Sponsor B, at a purchase price of 10.00 per Private Share, generating gross proceeds of 3,988,920 (including 3,490,320 from Sponsor A and 498,600 from Sponsor B). The net proceeds from the Private Shares were added to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination by May 17, 2023 (or up to November 17, 2023 if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination), the proceeds from the sale of the Private Shares will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Share will expire worthless.

 The founders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell 50 of its founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination, or (B) the date on which the closing price of the Company s Common Stock equals or exceeds 12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the Company s initial business combination and the remaining 50 of the founder shares may not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of the Company s initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to the Company s initial business combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property. As more fully discussed in the section of this report entitled Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Conflicts of Interest, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, including our founders, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to other entities that may take priority over their duties to us. Other than as set forth elsewhere in this report, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid to our founders, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination although we may consider cash or other compensation to officers or advisors we may hire subsequent to the IPO to be paid either prior to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our founders, advisors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Promissory Note On March 19, 2021, Sponsor A agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate amount of 400,000 to be used, in part, for transaction costs incurred in connection with IPO (the Promissory Note ). The Promissory Note is unsecured, interest-free and due at the earlier of August 31, 2022 or closing of the IPO. The Company repaid the 350,000 outstanding balance upon the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2022. Working Capital Loans In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founders or an affiliate of our founders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no Trust Funds would be used for such repayment. Up to 3,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into Private Shares at 10.00 per share at the option of the lender. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founders or an affiliate of our founders as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no borrowings under the working capital loans. Others After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Private Shares sold in the Private Placement, the Private Shares issuable upon conversion of working capital loans (if any), and the Founder Shares.

 RELATED PARTY POLICY We have adopted a code of ethics requiring us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our board of directors (or the appropriate committee of our board) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our code of ethics, conflict of interest situations will include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the company. In addition, our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions. These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our founders unless we, or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, other than as set forth elsewhere in this report and the S-1, no finder s fees, reimbursements or cash payments will be made to our founders, existing advisors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination although we may consider cash or other compensation to officers or advisors we may hire subsequent to the IPO to be paid either prior to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, the following payments will be made to our founders or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the Trust Funds prior to the completion of our initial business combination: Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination; and Repayment of loans which may be made by our founders or an affiliate of our founders to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to 3,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into working capital shares, at a price of 10.00 per share at the option of the lender. 
 Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our founders or their affiliates. ITEM 14.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Prime Number Acquisition I Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Prime Number Acquisition I Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 25, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period from February 25, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has no revenue, its business plan is dependent on the completion of a financing transaction and the Company s cash and working capital are not sufficient to complete its planned activities one year from the issuance of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation of the events and conditions and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. April 3, 2023

The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, it is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. Activities before May 17, 2022 are related to the formation and IPO, while the activities after May 17, 2022 are mainly focused on searching and identifying the Business Combination target. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the IPO. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The Company s sponsors are Prime Number Acquisition LLC Sponsor A and Glorious Capital LLC Sponsor B (collectively the Sponsors ), both are Delaware limited liability companies. The registration statement for the Company s IPO became effective on May 12, 2022. On May 17, 2022, the Company consummated the initial public offering (the IPO of units (the Public Units which included units issued upon the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of per unit, with each Public Unit consists of share (the Public Shares of the Company s Class A common stock (the Class A common stock ), one half of one warrant, and right, generating gross proceeds of . Simultaneously with the IPO, the Company completed the private sale of shares of the Class A common stock (the Private Shares to the Company s Sponsors, including shares to Sponsor A and shares to Sponsor B, at a purchase price of per Private Share, generating gross proceeds of (including from Sponsor A and from Sponsor B), which is described in Note 4. Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement on May 17, 2022, the proceeds of (or per Public Unit) in the aggregate from the IPO and the private placement were placed in a trust account (the Trust Account as defined in Note 5) with Wilmington Trust, N.A. acting as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. These funds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination or the liquidation due to the Company s failure to complete a Business Combination within the applicable period of time. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s holders of its outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders ). In addition, interest income earned on the funds in the Trust Account may be released to the Company to pay its income or other tax obligations. With these exceptions, expenses incurred by the Company may be paid prior to a Business Combination only from the net proceeds of the IPO and private placement not held in the Trust Account. Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the Company s initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least of the value of the funds in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account), which the Company refers to as the test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial Business Combination, although the Company may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds of the Trust Account balance. If the Company is no longer listed on Nasdaq, it will not be required to satisfy the test. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsors and any of the Company s officers or directors that may hold Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) (the Initial Stockholders have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares, the Private Shares, and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to convert any shares (including the Insider Shares) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve, or sell the shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with, a proposed Business Combination. The Company s Initial Stockholders have agreed (A) to vote their Founder Shares, Private Shares and any Public Shares they own in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, prior to and unrelated to an initial Business Combination, an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s redemption obligation to redeem all public shares if the Company cannot complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), unless the Company provides Public Stockholders an opportunity to redeem their public shares in conjunction with any such amendment, (C) not to redeem any shares, including Founder Shares, Private Shares and any Public Shares they own into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve the Company s proposed initial Business Combination or sell any shares to the Company in any tender offer in connection with its proposed initial Business Combination, and (D) that the Founder Shares and Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the shares sold the IPO. The Initial Stockholders and underwriters have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Insider Shares, Private Shares, and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. The Company will have until May 17, 2023 (or November 17, 2023 if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

 . In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsors have agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the Underwriters of this IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then the Sponsors will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. On December 29, 2022, the Company, Prime Number Merger Sub Inc. Merger Sub ), a Delaware corporation, NOCO-NOCO PTE. LTD noco-noco ), a Singapore private company limited by shares, and certain shareholders of noco-noco Sellers entered into the Business Combination Agreement the Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which, (i) the Company shall merge with and into Merger Sub, with the Company being the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo, a Cayman Islands company to be formed pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and (ii) following the merger, New SubCo, a Singapore private company to be formed pursuant to the Merger Agreement, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Sellers, in exchange for PubCo to issue to the Sellers PubCo Ordinary Shares. Going Concern As of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of and a working capital of (excluding investments held in trust account, deferred underwriting fee payable, deferred income tax liability and taxes payable). The Company s liquidity needs up to the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2022 had been satisfied through proceeds from notes payable and advances from a related party and from the issuance of common stock. The Company has 12 months from the closing of the IPO to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with working capital. The Company s management plans to continue its efforts to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. If the estimated costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to its Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete its Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon consummation of its Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination.

 unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. The Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company may be subject to potential examination by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. Founder Shares as a result of the Underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option on May 17, 2022. On June 3, 2022, the Sponsors executed cancellation notices to the transfer agent to forfeit the remaining shares for no consideration. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share and related weighted average of the shares does not consider the effect of the warrants and rights issued in connection with the (i) IPO, and (ii) the private placement since the exercise of the warrants and rights are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The warrants are exercisable to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate, and the rights are exercisable to convert shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate. At December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented. The net income (loss) per share presented in the statements of operations is based on the following: ) Accretion of common stock to redemption value ) Subsequent measurement of common stock subject to redemption value ) Net loss including accretion of common stock to redemption value ) )

 per share as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of shares of redeemable common stock are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero. Public Units which included units issued upon the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. Each Public Unit consists of share of Class A common stock, par value per share, one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants ), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of per share, and right (the Public Rights ), each Public Right entitling the holder thereof to exchange for one-eighth (1/8) of one Class A Common Stock upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination. Because the Warrants may only be exercised for whole numbers of shares, only an even number of Warrants may be exercised. The Warrants will become exercisable on the later of after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or from the closing of the IPO, and will expire after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Each Right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock at the closing of a Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of Rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL. As a result, the holder of the Rights must hold Rights in multiples of eight (8) in order to receive shares of Class A common stock for all of their rights upon closing of a Business Combination. All of the Public Shares sold as part of the Public Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. The Company s redeemable Class A common stock is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings, or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the U.S. based Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Certain amount of such loans may be convertible into working capital shares at per share at the option of the lender. The working capital shares would be identical to the shares sold in the private placement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

Rights Each holder of a right (the Rights will receive one-eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock upon consummation of a Business Combination, even if the holder of such Right redeemed all shares held by it in connection with a Business Combination. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of the rights. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the unit purchase price paid for by investors in the IPO. If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis and each holder of a Right will be required to affirmatively covert its Rights in order to receive 1/8 share underlying each Right (without paying additional consideration). The shares issuable upon conversion of the Rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the Rights upon consummation of a Business Combination. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Rights. Accordingly, the Rights may expire worthless. Warrants Each redeemable warrant (the Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase share of common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. The Warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion of an initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the IPO. However, no Public Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within 90 days from the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis. The Warrants will expire from the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at 5:00 p.m., New York City time or earlier redemption. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our founders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by founders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination (net of redemption), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s Class A common stock during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Price is below per share, the exercise price of the Warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the Market Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

 If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Except as described above, no warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the common stock have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless.

 As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income. In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. The change in the valuation allowance was for the year ended December 31, 2022. The provisions for U.S. federal and state income taxes were (including deferred income tax provision of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 25, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, respectively.

Exhibit 4.8 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OF THE REGISTRANT Pursuant to the existing certificate of incorporation of Prime Number Acquisition I Corp. PNAC , our Company , the Company , we or us ), our authorized capital stock consists of 50,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 0.0001 par value, 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 0.0001 par value, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 0.0001 par value. Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, we have adopted the amended and restated certificate of incorporation pursuant to which our authorized capital stock consists of 20,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 0.0001 par value, 100,000 shares of Class B common stock, 0.0001 par value, and 400,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 0.0001 par value. The following description summarizes the material terms of our capital stock. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. Units Sold in the IPO Each unit has an offering price of 10.00 and consists of one whole share of Class A common stock, one-half of one redeemable warrant, and one right. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in the Company s Prospectus. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. This means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock at the closing of a business combination. We will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. As a result, you must hold rights in multiples of eight (8) in order to receive whole shares of Class A common stock for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. The Class A common stock, warrants, and rights comprising the units began separate trading on May 13, 2022. Once the shares of Class A common stock, warrants, and rights commence separate trading, holders would have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Class A common stock, warrants, and rights. Private shares Sold in the Private Placement With certain limited exceptions, the private shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to our founders, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The price of the private shares was determined in negotiations between our founders and the underwriter for the initial public offering of the Company (the IPO ), with reference to the prices paid by initial stockholders for such private shares in special purpose acquisition companies, which have recently consummated their initial public offerings. Common Stock Upon the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2022, 7,880,892 shares of our Class A common stock were outstanding, consisting of: 6,450,000 shares of our Class A common stock underlying the units being offered in the IPO; 398,892 shares of our Class A common stock underlying the private shares; and 1,612,500 shares of Class A common stock held by our founders 

 Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of the Class A common stock will vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, except as required by law. Unless specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or as required by applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of common stock that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders. Our board of directors will be divided into three classes, each of which generally serves for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. As the date of this report on Form 10-K, we do not have any shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Because our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our stockholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination. In accordance with NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on NASDAQ. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws, unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially set to be approximately 10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our founders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination. Unlike many blank check companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC s proxy rules. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. However, the participation of our founders or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in the Prospectus), if 

 any, could result in the approval of our business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares of common stock sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. Our stockholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our business combination, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete the business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15 and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. If we seek stockholder approval in connection with our business combination, our founders have agreed to vote their founder shares and private shares as well as any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our founders founder shares and private shares, we would need 2,219,305, or 34.41 , of the 6,450,000 public shares sold in the IPO to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction (subject to the limitation described in the preceding paragraph). Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we are unable to complete our business combination by May 17, 2023 (within 12 months from the closing of the IPO) (or by November 17, 2023, or up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) (the Combination Period ), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital purposes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our founders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares and private shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination within the Combination Period. However, if our founders acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time period. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our stockholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Our stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock, except that we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares 

 for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. Founder Shares and Private Shares The founder shares and private shares are designated as Class A common stock. Except as described below, the founder shares and private shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units being sold in the IPO, and holders of founder shares have the same stockholder rights as public stockholders, except that (i) the founder shares and private shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, (ii) our founders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (A) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares, private shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (B) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (a) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period or (b) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (C) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such time period, and (iii) the founder shares are shares of our Class A common stock converted from shares of our Class B common stock at the discretion of the holders at any time after the issuance or otherwise automatically at the closing of our initial business combination initially on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights as described herein and shares of our Class A common stock upon such conversion and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. If we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our founders have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) pursuant to the letter agreement to vote any founder shares and private shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. With certain limited exceptions, our founders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell 50 of its founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or (B) the date on which the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds 12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our initial business combination and the remaining 50 of the founder shares may not be transferred, assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the private shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with or related to our founders, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Preferred Stock Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preferred stock outstanding at the date 

 hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in the IPO. Warrants Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one whole share of our Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the IPO or 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. This means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants may be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants may trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. We will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A common stock underlying such unit. We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement; provided that if our Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a registration statement covering the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the Fair Market Value (defined below) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Fair Market Value. The Fair Market Value as used in this paragraph shall mean the volume weighted average price of the common stocks for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent. 

 Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A common stock equals or exceeds 16.50. Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of 0.01 per warrant; upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds 16.50 per share (including adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading Warrants Anti-Dilution Adjustments in the Prospetus) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending third business day before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. We will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A common stocks issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. We have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A common stock may fall below the 16.50 redemption trigger price (including adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading Warrants Anti-dilution Adjustments of the Prospectus) as well as the 11.50 (for whole shares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. No fractional Class A common stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down to the nearest whole number of the number of Class A common stock to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the warrants are exercisable for a security other than the Class A common stocks pursuant to the warrant agreement (for instance, if we are not the surviving company in our initial business combination), the warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as the warrants become exercisable for a security other than the Class A common stock, the Company (or surviving company) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act the security issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. Redemption procedures . A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person s affiliates), to the warrant agent s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8 (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. Anti-Dilution Adjustments . If the number of outstanding Class A common stock is increased by a capitalization or share dividend paid in common stocks to all or substantially all holders of Class A common stock, or by a split-up of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such capitalization or share dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding Class A common stock. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of Class A common stock entitling holders to purchase Class A common stock at a price less than the historical fair market value (as defined below) will be deemed a share dividend of a number of Class A common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A common stock) and (ii) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of common stock paid in such rights offering and (y) the historical fair market value. For these purposes, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible 

 into or exercisable for Class A common stock, in determining the price payable for Class A common stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) historical fair market value means the volume weighted average price of the common stock as reported during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights. In addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to all or substantially all of the holders of Class A common stock on account of such Class A common stock (or other securities into which the warrants are then convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid on the Class A common stock during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution, does not exceed 0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any other adjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price or to the number of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than 0.50 per share, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A common stock in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the Combination Period, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each common stock in respect of such event. If the number of outstanding Class A common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share split or reclassification of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in issued and outstanding Class A common stock. Whenever the number of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Class A common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter. In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another entity (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the registered holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of Class A common stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. The warrants were be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between VStock Transfer, LLC, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the 

 provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the Prospectus, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on Class A common stock as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to this report on Form 10-K, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive Class A common stock. After the issuance of Class A common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. No fractional warrants may be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants may trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. We have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. This provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created under the Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Rights Except in cases where we are not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock consummation of our initial business combination, even if the holder of a public right converted all shares of Class A common stocks held by him, her or it in connection with the initial business combination or an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with respect to our pre-initial business combination activities. In the event we will not be the surviving company upon completion of our initial business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive the kind and amount of securities or properties of the surviving entity that each one eighth (1/8) of one share of Class A common stock of the Company is entitled to receive upon consummation of the business combination. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive his, her or its Class A common stock upon consummation of an initial business combination. The Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours). If we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per Class A common stock consideration that the holders of the Class A common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into Class A common stock basis. Rights holders are not eligible to vote on or redeem in our initial business combination. We will not issue fractional shares of Class A common stock in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share. As a result, you must hold rights in multiples of eight (8) in order to receive whole shares of Class A common stock for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Additionally, in no event will we be required to net cash settle the rights. Accordingly, the rights may expire worthless. Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial conditions subsequent to completion of a 

 business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. Our Transfer Agent, Warrant Agent, and Right Agent The transfer agent for our common stock, warrant agent for our warrants, and right agent for our rights is VStock Transfer, LLC. We have agreed to indemnify VStock Transfer, LLC in its roles as transfer agent, warrant agent, and right agent, its agents and each of its stockholders, directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any liability due to any gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the indemnified person or entity. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65 of our common stock. Our founders, who collectively beneficially own approximately 23.77 of our common stock upon the closing of the IPO (assuming they do not purchase any units in the IPO), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100 of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes or for working capital purposes (less up to 50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to: (i) receive funds from the trust account; (ii) vote on any initial business combination; or (iii) vote on matters related to our pre-initial business combination activity; Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our founders, our directors or our officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; If a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act; 

 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of our assets held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and interest income earned on the trust account that is released to us to pay taxes or for working capital purposes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination; If our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares; and We will not complete our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions. Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers upon completion of the IPO. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a business combination with: a stockholder who owns 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an interested stockholder an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or an associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. A business combination includes a merger or sale of more than 10 of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 do not apply if: our board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested stockholder, prior to the date of the transaction; after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85 of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings. 

 Our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. Exclusive forum for certain lawsuits Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) arising under the Securities Act, as to which the federal district courts of the United States of America for the District of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, have concurrent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Special meeting of stockholders Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our board of directors, by our Chief Executive Officer or by our Chairman. Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders, must provide timely notice of their intent in writing. To be timely, a stockholder s notice will need to be received by the company secretary at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90 th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120 th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, proposals seeking inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply with the notice periods contained therein. Our bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a 

 stockholders meeting. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Action by written consent Subsequent to the consummation of the IPO, any action required or permitted to be taken by our common stockholders must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders other than with respect to our Class B common stock. Classified Board of Directors Our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Subject to the terms of any preferred stock, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office. Class B Common Stock Consent Right For so long as any shares of Class B common stock remain outstanding, we may not, without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision our certificate of incorporation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or special rights of the Class B common stock. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of Class B common stock may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding Class B common stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Class B common stock were present and voted. As the date of the Prospectus, we do not have any shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Securities Eligible for Future Sale Immediately after the consummation of the IPO, we have 8,461,392 shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 6,450,000 public shares sold in the IPO would be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the 1,612,500 founder shares and all of the 398,892 private shares are restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering. The founder shares, private shares and working capital shares issuable upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, are subject to transfer restrictions as set forth in the Prospectus. The founder shares, private shares and working capital shares issuable upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, will be subject to registration rights as more fully described below. Rule 144 Pursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock, warrants, or rights for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale. 

 Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock, warrants, or rights for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of: 1 of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal 84,613 shares immediately after the IPO (or 86,250 shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full); or the average weekly reported trading volume of Class A common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale. Sales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met: the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and materials required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. As a result, our initial stockholders will be able to sell their founder shares and private shares including working capital shares issuable upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination. Registration Rights The holders of the founder shares, private shares and working capital shares issuable upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the IPO, requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to our Class A common stock). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Listing of Securities Our units are listed on NASDAQ under the symbol PNAC . Our units, Class A common stock, warrants, and rights are separately listed in the NASDAQ under the symbols PNACU , PNAC , PNACW , and PNACR , respectively.
