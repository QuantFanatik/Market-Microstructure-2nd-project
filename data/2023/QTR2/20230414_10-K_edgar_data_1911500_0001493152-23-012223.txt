Business
Overview 

Note:
The purpose of the Labuan, Malaysia Company is to function as the current regional hub, carrying out the majority of physical operations
of the Company. Initially, we intend for our services to cover the whole of mainland of Malaysia. The Labuan company is part of our international
business structure that encompasses our expansion plans and provides other trade and tax benefits. 

catTHIS
Holdings Corp., a Nevada Corporation, is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, catTHIS Holdings Corp., a Company
organized in Labuan, Malaysia. The Nevada and Malaysia corporations share the same exact business plan. 

We
are a startup early-stage company that intend to provide digital marketing services through technology. Its leading mobile application
 catTHIS is a digital catalogue management platform that allows users to upload and share PDF catalogues anywhere and from
any devices for free. This environmental-friendly service would significantly bring down the number of physical printed catalogues, newspaper
advertisement, magazines and other printed materials. The key feature of this digital catalogue management platform is its engagement
metrics, which are extremely useful for users to understand how well its catalogue is reaching their audience. 

Our
Services 

Our
leading mobile application catTHIS is a digital catalogue management platform that allows users to upload and share PDF
catalogues anywhere and from any devices for free. This environmental-friendly service would significantly bring down the number of physical
printed catalogues, newspaper advertisement, magazines and other printed materials. The key feature of this digital catalogue management
platform is its engagement metrics, which are extremely useful for users to understand how well its catalogue is reaching their audience
as following: 

1. 
 Upload
 This function allows users to advertise by uploading PDF catalogues, images and description and it is using multiple methods
 (visual, descriptive and informative) to promote the products and services of the sellers. 

2. 
 Video
 This function allows the uploader to embed a Youtube Video to better enhance the description of the catalogues. 

3. 
 QR
 Scanner Users can just scan the catalogues and save it without going through the sometimes, long download and saving process. 

4. 
 Share
 The catalogue can be effortlessly shared with people who do not have the catTHIS App installed either through Whatsapp, Wechat
 or any other such social media platforms. 

2 

5. 
 Privatize
 The Privatize function enables additional approval for dedicated recipients. This allow the uploader of the
 catalogue marked private to decide the extent of information to be shared with the receiver. 

6. 
 Editing
 The App also allows for editing updates or changes to be incorporated directly into the format in the app. Catalogues are
 thus automatically updated and users do not need to print a new set of catalogues which can be costly, especially if the changes
 are minor. 

7. 
 Analytics
 The analytics function allows users to gain real-time data on the catalogues they have uploaded. 

8. 
 Organize
 The organize function helps users to save their catalogues and organize them into folders. This allows users to save a large
 number of catalogues without the use of additional space on their mobile devices. 

9. 
 News
 and Events This function allows users to push for news and events to selected catalogue followers. 

10. 
 Chat
 function The chat function allows for two-way communication between users (buyer and seller). This acts as a feedback loop
 to the seller as they can gather feedback from buyers instantly and be more responsive. 

Competition 

Our existing product is a combination between social media marketing, cloud storage and file management system. We see a demand in this
space of which no direct competitors are providing the same services in South East Asia. Our distinctive e-catalogue management system
is different from those features offered by existing social media platform such as Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Google Drive and etc. 

Core
competency 

Ability
of digital catalogue platform to connect user and potential seller catTHIS App allows user to save digital catalogue and marketing
materials effortlessly by using QR scanner which allow for quicker progression in marketing events as the visitors can just scan through
their QR scanner for marketing materials. The App also have the ability to allow users to gain access to real-time data whenever there
is an update or editing action being taken by the catalogue uploader, thus users do not need to print a new set of catalogues which can
be costly, especially if the changes are minor. 

In addition, the chat function also allows for the sales process to be faster compared to the physical catalogue which requires the buyer
to contact the representative from the seller for further action. The chat function can act as customer service and repeat sales channel
as sellers can continuously promote their products and services with their buyers and buyers can contact their sellers for after-sales
services such as maintenance services. 

Targeted
marketing through big data and analytics The analytics function allows users to find out the number of people that have downloaded
or saved the catalogues which allow users to track and gain information on potential sales. An user s act of downloading or saving
the catalogue is a behavioral cue that they might have some interest in the products and services highlighted by the catalogue. The probability
of converting such users into actual buyers is higher than those that shows no interest. Sellers can then better target their marketing
efforts on the catTHIS App by focusing on the data provided by the App to increase the success rate of their marketing campaigns. 

catTHIS
intend to provide targeted marketing services to retailers where they can leverage this data at a low fee while complying with data protection
regulations to reach out to prospective app users. Retailers will be able to avail catTHIS targeted marketing feature to target potential
app users in a specific country by identifying their targeted market based on selected tags associated with the product or service catalogue.
For instance, a furniture company can specifically target potential app user by filtering those who have downloaded or have seen catalogues
related to furniture in the past one month. 

Employees 

Our
only employee is our Mr. Yeo, our chief executive officer. We employ nine independent contractors who provide technical and administrative
support. Mr. Yeo and our contractors devote up to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary. 

We
do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt
plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our employees, Officers and/or Directors. 

Government
Regulation 

At
present, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements,
income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and supervisory
requirements.

5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Holders 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 126,737,500 shares of our Common Stock par value, .0001 issued and outstanding. There were 119 beneficial
owners of our Common Stock. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated
financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain
statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c)
anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They

 expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these
words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. 

The
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except to the extent required by federal securities
laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Basis
of presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements for catTHIS Holdings Corp. and its subsidiariy for the year ended December 31, 2022 is prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and include the accounts
of catTHIS Holdings Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, catTHIS Holdings Corp. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
on consolidation. The Company has adopted December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Basis
of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Use
of estimates 

Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported
revenue and expenses during the year reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Intangible
assets, net 

The
Company follows ASC 360 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators of impairment
are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets carrying amounts.
For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of intangible assets. 

The
amortization is provided on straight line method so as to write off the amortization amount of the respective classes of intangible assets
as follows: 

Rate 

Intangible asset 
 20 

Property,
plant and equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational. 

Categories 
 Estimated useful life 
 Depreciation rate 
 
 Office equipment 
 10 years 
 10 
 
 Photography and videography equipment 
 5 years 
 20 

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of plant and equipment is the difference between
the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations 

Lease 

The
Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with ASC 842. 

The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated
with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. 

In
determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company
incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments. 

Revenue
recognition 

In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the
terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations
in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to
contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers
to its clients. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of technical consultancy on solar power system and consultancy on green energy solution. 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

Foreign
currencies translation 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

The
reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars US ). The Company s subsidiary in Labuan maintains its
books and record in United States Dollars US respectively, and Ringgits Malaysia MYR is functional currency
as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity. 

Translation
of amounts from MYR into US 1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective year: 

As
 of and for the year ended December 31, 

2022 
 2021

Related
parties 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. 

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

In
September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which replaces the incurred-loss
impairment methodology and requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur for most financial assets, including
trade receivables. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses will be recognized as allowances for credit
losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning January
1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the potential impact of the new guidance and related codification
improvements will be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s
present or future financial statements. 

Off-Balance

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Disclosures
Control and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer cum Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer cum Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses
which have caused management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i)
inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting
and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Director,
 Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary 

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our executive officer and director for the past five
years. 

Yeo
Choon Pin Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Ofiicer, Director 

Mr. Yeo is our sole director and executive officer. For more than 30 years, Mr. Yeo has been actively involved in media and publishing
industries, during which he has developed an extensive international network and resources. In 2002, he was elected as a Council Member
in Singapore Confederation of Industries (now known as the Singapore Manufacturing Federation), and was instrumental in supporting numerous
incoming and outgoing trade delegations in Asia. In 2003, Mr. Yeo was invited by the Malaysian government to relocate its operation into
Malaysia, and shortly after, established the Automation Technology Industry Group under the aegis of Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers
(FMM) and became the first Chairman representing the voice of the industrial automation industry in Malaysia. In 2004, after the launch
of the Thailand Elite Club by Tourism Authority of Thailand, Mr. Yeo was appointed as Vice President that represents the Thailand Elite
Membership Project in Singapore and Malaysia. In 2007, he was appointed by Board of Investments (BOI) of Thailand to assist in the collaboration
programs of the Alliance of Supporting Industries Association (ASIA) and making Automation Technology Group in Thailand as the 14th industry
grouping in the alliance. In 2020, he was appointed Secretary of Communication and Media of Brunei Darussalam BIMP-EAGA Business Council
(BDBEBC), an umbrella organization for the private sector in the subregion and enjoys fifth country status in EAGA co-operation.
Also in 2020, Mr. Yeo was also appointed as Chairman (Singapore Representative) of ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and Directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

Our
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our
Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believes that it is not necessary to have
such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
director has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined
in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in
Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the
FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because
management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that
retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome
and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash
flows from operations to date. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
Director and our Executive officer have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 

13 

3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent member of our Board of Directors, and do not anticipate having independent Directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Director evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined
that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business
conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future,
we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive
Officer, Yeo Choon Pin, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership
of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition
rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect
the person s actual voting power at any particular date. 

(1) 
 Beneficial
 ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable
 or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table. In determining the percent of common stock owned by a person or entity as
 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding on as of the date of this Annual Report (126,737,500
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of catTHIS Holdings Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity,
and cash flows for the each of two years in the year ended of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each
of two years in the year ended Deccember 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s losses from operations, accumulated
deficit and negative operating cash flows raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

F- 2 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical
audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Recoverability
and impairment of trade receivables 

The
Company s trade receivables amounted USD78,337 as at December 31, 2022 represents approximately 48.75 of the Company s total assets. 

We
focus and assess the recoverability of the trade receivables involved judgements and estimation uncertainty in analyzing historical
trend of payment, indicators of expected credit losses (ECL) and customer
payment terms. Auditing trade receivables is an essential component of the
financial audit process. 

Our
audit procedures in this area among others to test the existence, completeness, accuracy, and valuation of trade receivables included
the following: 

(a) 
 Obtaining
 debtor confirmation requests to the Company s customers to confirm the balances of their outstanding receivables; 

(b) 
 Reviewing
 ageing analysis of receivables and testing the reliability thereof; 

(c) 
 Reviewing
 subsequent collections for major receivables and overdue amount; and 

(d) 
 Making
 inquiries of management regarding the action plans to recover overdue amount;

, net loss of and negative operating cash flows of . These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are
issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its shareholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or,
if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stock holders, in the case of equity financing.

(c)
Credit risk 

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the
concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively
short collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance
for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. 

(d)
Exchange rate risk 

The
Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain stable, therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post
the same amount of income for two comparable periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower income
depending on exchange rate of RM converted to US on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and
economic environments without notice.
