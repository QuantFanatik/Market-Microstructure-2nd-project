Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of 36,380,313 and 35,222,530 as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which include net losses of 1,157,782 and 1,401,237 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company had a working capital deficit of 4,603,481 and 3,853,272, respectively, with limited cash resources. Consequently, the items mentioned above raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to raise additional debt or equity and continue to settle obligations by issuing stock. Management intends to continue to grow other debt and equity until the Company has positive cash flows from an operating company. 10 Table of Contents The Company s ability to continue as a going concern depends on its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company cannot obtain additional funds when required or if the funds cannot be received on favorable terms, management may be necessary to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make specific estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and decisions on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes are important when preparing financial statements. The actual results could differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. Due to the need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters, materially different amounts could be reported under other conditions or using different assumptions. We regularly review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in preparing our financial statements. Please refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as this Annual Report includes disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include common stock valuation and options issued as stock-based compensation. 11 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from its customer contracts following ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes revenues when satisfying the performance obligation of the associated contract that reflects the consideration expected to be received based on the terms of the contract. Revenue related to contracts with customers is evaluated utilizing the following steps: 1. Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Leases Effective October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (the FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), and additional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the new leases standard ), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing critical information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the new lease standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. There were no long-term operating lease contracts for the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 that require access to (i) whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial direct costs. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognize compensation over the service period they are expected to vest. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants. The estimated value of the portion of a stock-based award that is ultimately expected to vest, considering estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The expected volatility is estimated based on the most recent historical period of other comparative securities, equal to the weighted average life of the options. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures, such differences are accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to compensation expenses and recorded in the period that estimates are revised. For the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company incurred 00 and 10,000 for stock-based compensation, respectively. 12 Table of Contents Fair Value FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure s ASC 820 establishes a framework for all fair value measurements and expands disclosures related to fair value measurement and developments. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1 Quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable inputs; Level 2 Significant other observable inputs that observable market data can corroborate; and Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that observable market data cannot corroborate. The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. It determined that the convertible notes should be classified as a liability since the conversion option becomes effective at issuance, resulting in no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion options. The Company accounts for convertible notes and warrants as derivative liabilities due to there being no explicit limit to the number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of all conversion options. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, ASC Subtopic 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options . The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting; and, (2) convertible debt instruments issued with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 13 Table of Contents Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 14 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To: Shareholders and Board of Directors Authentic Holdings, Inc (formerly Global Fiber Technologies, Inc.) Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompany consolidated financial statements of Authentic Holdings, Inc. (formerly Global Fiber Technologies, Inc.) which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Authentic Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Substantial Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s accumulated deficit, net loss and working capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters A critical audit matter is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the Company s governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating a critical audit, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We have determined there are critical matters related to the Company s Embedded Derivative Liabilities related to Convertible Debentures. Accounting for Embedded Derivative Liabilities related to Convertible Debentures As described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had convertible debentures that required accounting considerations and significant estimates. The Company determined that variable conversion features issued in connection with certain convertible debentures required derivative liability classification. These variable conversion features were initially measured at fair value and subsequently have been remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. The Company determined the fair value of the embedded derivatives using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. We identified the accounting considerations and related valuations, including the related fair value determinations of the embedded derivative liabilities of such as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination were: (1) the accounting consideration in determining the nature of the various features (2) the evaluation of the potential derivatives and potential bifurcation in the instruments, and (3) considerations related to the determination of the fair value of the various debt and equity instruments and the conversion features that include valuation models and assumptions utilized by management. An audit of these elements is especially challenging and requires auditor judgement due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed. Our audit procedures related to management s conclusion on the evaluation and related valuation of embedded derivatives, included the following, among others: (1) evaluating the relevant terms and conditions of the various financings, (2) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Company with respect to the accounting for the convertible debt, and the assessment and accounting for potential derivatives and (3) independently recomputing the valuations determined by Management.

NOTES TO AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 shares of authorized common stock, par value and shares of authorized preferred stock, par value per share. On June 18, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of assets from A.H. Originals, Inc. ("AHO"), a corporation controlled by the same owner group of Authentic Holdings Inc. formerly Global Fiber Technologies, Inc., for the consideration of shares of common stock of the Company to be issued and the issuance of a promissory note of that bears interest per annum and have a one-year term with eight options to extend the maturity date for three-month periods. In addition, the Company issued to AHO common shares of Authentic Heroes, Inc. ("AHI"), a subsidiary created by the Company, to hold the purchased assets. Going Concerned The accompanying financial statements have been prepared following U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of as of December 31, 2022, which includes a net loss of and a net working capital deficit of , with limited cash resources. Consequently, the items mentioned above raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to raise additional debt or equity and continue to settle obligations by issuing stock. Management intends to continue to grow other debt and equity until the Company has positive cash flows from an operating company. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern depends on its ability to repay or settle its current indebtedness, generate positive cash flow from an operating company, and raise capital through equity and debt financing or other means on desirable terms. If the Company cannot obtain additional funds when required or if the funds cannot be received on favorable terms, management may be necessary to restructure the Company or cease operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 20 Table of Contents Principles of Consolidation owned subsidiaries, Pure361, Leading Edge Fashions, LLC, and ECO CHAIN 360, Inc., had no operations, assets, or liabilities as of December 31, 2022, and 2021.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation Of Disclosure Controls And Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (our chief executive officer), we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 , as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms relating to our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Management s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for our company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our president and our chief executive officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date due to the factors stated below. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses: Insufficient Resources : We have an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. Inadequate Segregation Of Duties : We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. Lack Of Audit Committee: We do not have a functioning audit committee resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. Management is committed to improving its internal controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) may consider appointing an audit committee member in the future. Management, including our president and our chief executive officer, have discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
