 PART I ITEM 1 . BUSINESS General Universal Security Instruments, Inc. we or the Company designs and markets a variety of popularly priced safety products consisting primarily of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and related products. Most of our products require minimal installation and are designed for easy installation by the consumer without professional assistance and are sold through retail stores. We also market products to the electrical distribution trade through our wholly owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc. USI Electric ). The electrical distribution trade includes electrical and lighting distributors as well as manufactured housing companies. Products sold by USI Electric usually require professional installation. Our sales for the year ended March 31, 2023, were 22,178,873 compared to 19,549,785 for the year ended March 31, 2022. We reported net income of 720,411 in fiscal 2023 compared to a net loss of 78,150 in fiscal 2022, an increase in net earnings of 798,561. The increase in net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, is primarily due to increases in sales to retail customers as previously discussed above and to decreased expenditures related to a terminated proposed Merger as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, is attributed to increased legal and consulting fees associated with the proposed merger (described below). The Company was incorporated in Maryland in 1969. Our principal executive office is located at 11407 Cronhill Drive, Suite A, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117, and our telephone number is 410-363-3000. Information about us may be obtained from our website www.universalsecurity.com. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, are available free of charge on our website as soon as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a link to the SEC s EDGAR reporting system. Simply select the Investor Relations menu item, and then click on the SEC Filings link. The SEC s EDGAR reporting system can also be accessed directly at www.sec.gov. Proposed Merger As previously reported, on February 25, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement by and among the Company (USI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company D-U Merger Sub, Inc. a Delaware corporation Merger Sub and Infinite Reality, Inc., a Delaware corporation Infinite Reality whereby Infinite Reality was to merge with and into the Merger Sub (the Merger ). On December 12, 2022, Infinite Reality terminated the Merger Agreement. Safety Products We market a line of residential smoke and carbon monoxide alarms under the trade names UNIVERSAL and USI Electric both of which are manufactured by Eyston Company Limited (Eyston) in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), a principal supplier of the Company s products. Our line of safety alarms consists of units powered by replaceable batteries, ten-year sealed batteries, or 120-volt units with a battery backup. Our replaceable battery products contain different types of batteries with different battery lives, and some include alarm silencers. The smoke alarms marketed to the electrical distribution trade also include hearing impaired and heat alarms with a variety of features. We also market door chimes, ventilation products, ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI s), and other electrical devices. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc., focuses its sales and marketing efforts to maximize safety product sales, especially smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms manufactured by Eyston, to the electrical distribution trade. Import Matters We import all our products. As an importer, we are subject to numerous tariffs which vary depending on types of products and country of origin, changes in economic and political conditions in the country of manufacture, potential trade restrictions, and currency fluctuations. Substantially all our safety products are imported from the People s Republic of China. Certain of these products are currently subject to tariffs of twenty-five percent.

 We have attempted to protect ourselves from fluctuations in currency exchange rates to the extent possible by negotiating commitments in U.S. dollars. Our inventory purchases are also subject to delays in delivery due to problems with shipping and docking facilities, as well as other problems associated with purchasing products abroad. Sales and Marketing; Customers We sell our products to various customers, and our total sales market can be divided generally into two categories; sales by the Company to retailers, including wholesale distributors, chain, discount, television retailers and home center stores, catalog and mail order companies and other distributors retailers ), and sales by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade (primarily electrical and lighting distributors and manufactured housing companies) and foreign customers. Products marketed by the Company have historically been retailed to do-it-yourself consumers by these retailers. Products marketed by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade typically require professional installation. We do not currently market a significant portion of our products directly to end users. A significant portion of our sales are made by approximately 40 independent sales organizations, compensated by commission, which represents approximately 100 sales representatives, some of which have warehouses where USI Electric products are maintained for sale. In addition, the Company has established a national distribution system with eight regional stocking warehouses throughout the United States which generally enables customers to receive their orders the next day without paying for overnight freight charges. Our agreements with these sales organizations are generally cancelable by either party upon 30 days notice. We do not believe that the loss of any one of these organizations would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Sales are also made directly by the officers and full-time employees of the Company and our USI Electric subsidiary, some of whom have other responsibilities for the Company. Sales outside the United States are made by our officers and through exporters and amounted to less than five percent of total net sales in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. We also market our products through our website and through our own sales catalogs and brochures, which are mailed directly to customers. Our customers, in turn, may advertise our products in their own catalogs and brochures and in their ads in newspapers and other media. We also exhibit and sell our products at various trade shows, including the annual National Hardware Show. Our backlog of orders as of March 31, 2023, was approximately 2,382,000. Our backlog as of March 31, 2022, was approximately 6,028,000. The decrease in backlog is primarily due to a resumption in shipping of orders during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 after experiencing delays unloading freight at California ports of entry caused by or related to COVID-19 issues in the prior fiscal year. Suppliers The majority of our products are manufactured for us by Eyston and amounted to approximately 88.5 and 83.6 of our purchases for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Certain other private label products are also manufactured for us by foreign suppliers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good. The loss of any of our other suppliers would have a short-term adverse effect on our operations, but replacement sources for these suppliers could be developed. Competition In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, sales of safety products accounted for substantially all of our total sales. In the sale of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, we compete in all of our markets with First Alert and Walter Kidde Portable Equipment, Inc. These companies have greater financial resources and financial strength than we have. However, we believe that our safety products compete favorably in the market primarily on the basis of styling, features, and pricing. The safety industry in general involves changing technology. The success of our products may depend on our ability to improve and update our products in a timely manner and to adapt to new technological advances. Employees As of March 31, 2023, we had eleven employees, seven of whom are engaged in administration and sales, and the balance of whom are engaged in product development. Our employees are not unionized, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Effective March 2022, we extended our operating lease for a 15,000 square foot office and warehouse located in Baltimore County, Maryland to expire in April 2025 subject to a right to terminate the lease if the Company enters into a binding agreement to sell the assets of the Company. Monthly rental expense, with common area maintenance, currently approximates 15,000 and increases 3.0 per year. Effective March 2003, we entered into an operating lease for office space in Naperville, Illinois. This lease, consisting of 3,400 square feet, is continued on a month-to-month basis. The monthly rental, with common area maintenance, was approximately 4,900 per month during the current fiscal year. The Company believes that its current facilities are currently suitable and adequate. ITEM 3 . LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time the Company is involved in various claims and routine litigation matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 PART II ITEM 5 . MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market for Common Stock Our common stock, .01 par value (the Common Stock trades on the NYSE MKT LLC exchange, under the symbol UUU. As of March 31, 2023, there were 127 record holders of the Common Stock. The closing price for the Common Stock on that date was 2.32. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and it is our present intention to retain all cash flow for use in future operations. ITEM 7 . MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words or phrases will likely result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, estimate, project or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and readers are advised that various factors, including Risk Factors discussed in earlier filings, and other risks could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements. General We are in the business of marketing and distributing safety and security products which are primarily manufactured in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). Our consolidated financial statements detail our sales and other operational results. Accordingly, the following discussion and analysis of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 relate to the operational results of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. In light of shutdowns, quarantines and other restrictions and delays in operations caused by or related to COVID-19 in the PRC and the United States, the Company experienced delays in shipping and receiving of products during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, and continues to experience shortages of critical components for manufacturing of our products through and subsequent to March 31, 2023. Other than as reflected in our financial statements, we are not yet able to quantify the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales and financial results. Sales during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, increased when compared to sales for the comparable 2022 period, primarily due to less delays in unloading freight at California ports of entry thereby improving delivery schedules. However, domestic freight costs have increased. Our sales growth has been due primarily to increased retail sales to large national retailers. Our overall sales are primarily dependent upon the strength of the U.S. housing market. As stated elsewhere in this report, our USI Electric subsidiary markets our products to the electrical distribution trade (primarily electrical and lighting distributors and manufactured housing companies); conditions that impact new home construction and new home sales directly impacts sales by our USI Electric subsidiary. Our operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 continue to be dependent upon the economic conditions of the U.S. housing market. We further believe that the movement of the smoke and carbon monoxide alarm retail markets toward ten-year sealed alarms to comply with new laws passed in several states will benefit future sales of our line of ten-year sealed battery units, GFCI s, and other electrical devices. The importation of certain wiring devices, carbon-monoxide alarms, and photo-electric alarms are currently subject to tariffs of 25 .

 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 Sales. In fiscal year 2023, our net sales were 22,178,873 compared to sales in the prior year of 19,549,785, an increase of 2,629,088 (13.4 ). The increase in sales was primarily due to increased sales to existing retail customers. Gross Profit. Gross profit percentage is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales. Our gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, was 28.6 compared to 30.9 in fiscal 2022. The decrease in 2023 gross margin is attributed to variations in the mix of products sold as certain products are subject to tariff charges that directly impact gross margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 4,974,453 in fiscal 2023 from 5,524,343 in fiscal 2022. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses were 22.4 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and 28.3 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales as they do not change in direct proportion to increases in sales. These expenses decreased as a dollar amount due primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages which decreased by approximately 181,000 resulting from the federal employee retention credit program, and legal and consulting fees associated with the terminated proposed Merger. Engineering and Product Development. Engineering and product development expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, was 402,692. Engineering and product development expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, was 438,200. The decrease in overall engineering and product development expense for the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period was due to reduced payroll expenditures and decreased independent testing of products. Interest Expense (Net). For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company incurred net interest expense of 237,686 and 147,840, respectively, related to borrowing costs associated with interest paid on amounts borrowed from our factor and on extended trade payables due to Eyston. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from increases in interest rates on borrowing from our factor during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, to fund inventory purchases and operating cash requirements. Income Taxes. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 our statutory Federal tax rate was 21.0 . The Company has accumulated net operating losses and other income tax credits for which a full valuation allowance has been established. Accordingly, income taxes or deferred income tax benefits indicated by the provision for income taxes as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 varies from the expected statutory rate. Footnote E to the financial statements provides a reconciliation of the amount of tax that would be expected at statutory rates and the amount of tax expense or benefit provided at the effective rate of tax for each fiscal period. Net Income (Loss). We reported net income of 720,411 for the fiscal year 2023, compared to a net loss of 78,150 for fiscal 2022, an increase of 798,561 (1,021.8 in net income. The increase in net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, is primarily due to increases in sales to retail as previously discussed above and to decreased expenditures related to a terminated proposed Merger and payroll expenditures as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, is attributed to increased legal and consulting expense associated with the terminated proposed Merger. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company reported net income of 720,411, and a net loss of 78,150 for the years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, working capital (computed as the excess of current assets over current liabilities) increased by 724,528 from 4,451,947 on March 31, 2022, to 5,176,475 on March 31, 2023. Our operating activities provided cash of 1,491,943 for the year ended March 31, 2023. Operating activities provided cash principally from a decrease in inventories of 2,165,429, net income of 720,411, and decreases in accounts receivable and amounts due from factor of 425,165. Operating activities used cash principally due to repayment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1,918,493. Our operating activities used cash of 1,860,051 for the year ended March 31, 2022. Operating activities used cash principally to increase trade accounts receivable and amounts due from factor of 1,506,650, to increase inventories by 1,977,868, a net loss of 78,150, and is partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1,669,566, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 95,357.

 Our investing activities did not provide or use cash during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, or 2022. Financing activities used cash of 1,779,176 reflecting the decrease in net borrowing from the Factor of 697,736 and the repayment of the Note Payable to Eyston in the amount of 1,081,440 during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, financing activities provided cash of 2,138,182 reflecting the increase in net borrowing from the Factor. Our overall sales are primarily dependent upon the strength of the U.S. housing market. As stated elsewhere in this report, our USI Electric subsidiary markets our products to the electrical distribution trade (primarily electrical and lighting distributors and manufactured housing companies); demand in new home construction and new home sales directly impacts sales by our USI Electric subsidiary. Our operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 continue to be dependent upon the economic conditions of the U.S. housing market. Management believes that with an improved housing market and sales of our sealed products, the Company will continue to improve profitability. Management expects our product offerings, including sealed battery alarm and ground fault circuit interrupter products, will compete in price and functionality with similar products offered by our larger competitors. While we believe there will be market acceptance of our products, we cannot be assured of this. Should our products not achieve the level of acceptance we anticipate, this could have a significant effect on our future operations, and our sales may decline, affecting our ability to continue operating in our current fashion. Our short-term borrowings to finance operations, trade accounts receivable, and foreign inventory purchases are provided pursuant to the terms of our Factoring Agreement with Merchant Factors Corporation (Merchant or Factor). Borrowings under our Factoring Agreement bear interest at prime plus 2 and are secured by trade accounts receivable and inventory. Advances from Merchant are at the sole discretion of Merchant based on their assessment of the Company s receivables, inventory and financial condition at the time of each request for an advance. The unused availability of this facility totaled approximately 852,000 on March 31, 2023. Related Party Transactions Pursuant to its written charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company reviews and approves all transactions with related persons that are required to be disclosed under applicable regulation. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, inventory purchases and other company expenses of approximately 1,748,000 and 1,582,000, respectively, were charged to credit card accounts of Harvey B. Grossblatt, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and certain of his immediate family members. The Company subsequently reimbursed these charges in full. Mr. Grossblatt receives travel mileage and other credit card benefits from these charges. The maximum amount outstanding and due to Mr. Grossblatt at any point during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 may include amounts submitted for personal expense reimbursement and amounts paid by Mr. Grossblatt for inventory purchases or other company expenses and amounted to approximately 217,000 and 211,000, respectively, and the amount outstanding at March 31, 2023 and 2022 is approximately 0 and 44,000, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies Management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Table of Contents 
 We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note A to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, current economic trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies include: Income Taxes : The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences may result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and a valuation allowance is provided whenever it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. After a review of projected taxable income, the components of the deferred tax asset, and the current global economic conditions including unresolved supply chain issues related to the acquisition of electronic microchips, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the remaining components of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This determination was made based on the Company s prior history of losses from operations and the uncertainty as to whether the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to use the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established to fully offset the value of the deferred tax assets. Our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the timing of future taxable income and the expiration dates of the components of the deferred tax assets. If sufficient future taxable income is generated, we may be able to offset a portion of future tax expenses. The Company follows ASC 740-10 which provides guidance for tax positions related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters are recorded as income tax expenses. Revenue Recognition: The Company s primary source of revenue is the sale of safety and security products based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer. Customers may not return, exchange, or refuse acceptance of goods without our approval. Generally, the Company does not grant extended payment terms. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight, after control over a product has transferred to a customer, are accounted for as a cost of completing the sale and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for products sold. Revenue is recorded at the transaction price net of estimates of variable consideration. The Company uses the expected value method based on historical data in considering the impact of estimates of variable consideration, which may include trade discounts, allowances, product returns (including rights of return) or warranty replacements. Estimates of variable consideration are included in revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We have established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience. Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first in/first out method.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as such item is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Our Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 1992 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2023, because of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as discussed below. A material weakness arose during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, in the management review controls over classification of and disclosure of amounts within the financial statements. The Company plans to remediate the material weakness by clarification of the classification of amounts and inclusion of the required disclosures. A material weakness arose during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, in the management review controls over the classification of and accounting for income taxes.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total operating lease payments Less: amounts representing interest ) Present value of net operating lease payments Less: current portion ) Long-term portion of operating lease obligations that has no fixed expiration date. In addition, the Company has research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately 62,000 that begin to expire in the fiscal year ending 2030. There are certain limitations to the use and application of these items. Management reviews net operating loss carry forwards and income tax credit carry forwards to evaluate if those amounts are recoverable. After a review of projected taxable income, the components of the deferred tax asset, and the current global economic conditions including unresolved supply chain issues related to the acquisition of electronic microchips, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the remaining components of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This determination was made based on the Company s prior history of losses from operations and the uncertainty as to whether the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to use the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established to fully offset the value of the deferred tax assets. Our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the timing of future taxable income and the expiration dates of the components of the deferred tax assets.
