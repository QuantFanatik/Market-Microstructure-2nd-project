PART I

ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS.

General

Rave Restaurant Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or we, us or our franchises pizza buffet Buffet Units ), delivery/carry-out
 Delco Units and express Express Units restaurants under the trademark Pizza Inn and franchises fast casual pizza restaurants Pie Five Units under the trademarks Pie Five Pizza Company or Pie Five . The Company also licenses Pizza
 Inn Express, or PIE, kiosks PIE Units under the trademark Pizza Inn . We facilitate food, equipment, and supply distribution to our domestic and international system of restaurants through agreements with third party distributors.

As of June 25, 2023, we had 152 franchised Pizza Inn restaurants, 27 franchised Pie Five Units, and 5 licensed PIE Units. The 118 domestic franchised Pizza Inn restaurants
 were comprised of 77 Buffet Units, 7 Delco Units and 34 Express Units. As of June 25, 2023, there were 34 international franchised Pizza Inn restaurants. Domestic Pizza Inn restaurants and kiosks were located predominantly in the southern half
 of the United States, with Arkansas, Texas, North Carolina and Mississippi accounting for approximately 23 , 20 , 15 and 9 , respectively, of the total number of domestic units.

Our History

The Company has offered consumers affordable, high quality pizza since 1958, when the first Pizza Inn restaurant opened in Dallas, Texas. We awarded our first franchise in
 1963 and opened our first buffet restaurant in 1969. We began franchising the Pizza Inn brand internationally in the late 1970s. In 1993, our stock began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market and presently trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under
 the ticker symbol RAVE. In June 2011, we opened the first Pie Five restaurant in Ft. Worth, Texas. In November 2012, we signed our first franchise development agreement for Pie Five. In 2019, we launched the PIE kiosk and convenience store
 solution to meet the consumer demand for tasty and high-quality pizzas within a grab-and-go delivery model.

Our Concepts

We operate and franchise restaurant concepts under two distinct brands: Pizza Inn and Pie Five.

Pizza Inn 

We franchise Buffet Units, Delco Units and Express Units under the Pizza Inn brand. Additionally, we license PIE Units under the Pizza Inn brand. Buffet Units and Delco
 Units feature crusts that are hand-made from dough made fresh in the restaurant each day. Our pizzas are made with a proprietary all-in-one flour mixture, real mozzarella cheese, and a proprietary mix of classic pizza spices. In international
 markets, the menu mix of toppings and side items is occasionally adapted to local tastes.

2 

Index 

Buffet Units offer dine-in, carryout, and catering service and, in many cases, also offer delivery service. Buffet Units offer a variety of pizza crusts with standard
 toppings and special combinations of toppings in addition to pasta, salad, sandwiches, appetizers, desserts and beverages, including beer and wine in some locations, in an informal, family-oriented atmosphere. We occasionally offer other items
 on a limited promotional basis. Buffet Units are generally located in free standing buildings or strip center locations in retail developments near offices, shopping centers and residential areas. The current standard Buffet Units are between
 2,100 and 4,500 square feet in size and seat 120 to 185 customers. The interior decor is designed to promote a casual, lively, contemporary, family-style atmosphere. Some Buffet Units feature game rooms that offer a range of electronic game
 entertainment for the entire family.

Delco Units offer delivery and carryout service only and are typically located in shopping centers or other in-line retail developments. Delco Units typically offer a
 variety of crusts and some combination of side items. Delco Units occupy approximately 1,200 square feet, are primarily production facilities and, in most instances, do not offer seating. The decor of the Delco Unit is designed to be bright and
 highly visible and feature neon lighted displays and awnings. We have attempted to locate Delco Units strategically to facilitate timely delivery service and to provide easy access for carryout service.

Express Units serve our customers through a variety of non-traditional points of sale. Express Units are typically located in a convenience store, food court, college
 campus, airport terminal, travel plaza, athletic facility, or other commercial facility. They have limited or no seating and solely offer quick carryout service of a limited menu of pizza and other foods and beverages. An Express Unit typically
 occupies approximately 200 to 400 square feet and is commonly operated by the operator or food service licensee of the commercial host facility. We have developed a high-quality, pre-prepared crust that is topped and cooked on-site, allowing
 this concept to offer a lower initial investment and reduced labor and operating costs while maintaining product quality and consistency. Like Delco Units, Express Units are primarily production-oriented facilities and, therefore, do not require
 all of the equipment, labor or square footage of the Buffet Unit.

PIE Units serve customers through a non-traditional, licensed, pizza-only model called Pizza Inn Express. Like Delco Units and Express Units, the PIE Units are primarily
 production-oriented facilities and, therefore, do not require all of the equipment, labor or square footage of the Buffet Unit. The Company does not intend to open additional PIE Units in the foreseeable future.

Pie Five 

Pie Five is a fast-casual pizza concept that creates individualized pizzas which are baked in our specially designed oven. Pizzas are created at the direction of our
 customers who choose from a variety of freshly prepared and displayed proprietary and non-proprietary toppings, cheeses, sauces and doughs. Customers can also get freshly prepared side salads, also made to order from our recipes or at the
 customer s direction. A variety of soft beverages are available, as well as beer and wine in some locations.

Traditional Pie Five restaurants typically occupy leased, in-line or end-cap space of between 1,800 and 2,400 square feet in retail strip or multi-unit retail space. With
 seating for 65 to 85 customers in most units, and patio seating where available, Pie Five restaurants primarily serve lunch and dinner to families, adults and kids of all ages. Pie Five restaurants typically are in high traffic, high visibility
 urban or suburban sites in mid to large-size metropolitan areas. Sales are predominantly on-premise though carry out and delivery are offered as well. Due to the relatively compact footprint of the restaurants, and other operating advantages, we
 believe Pie Five is also well suited for non-traditional locations such as airports.

Site Selection

We consider the restaurant site selection process critical to a restaurant s long-term success and devote significant resources to the investigation and evaluation of
 potential sites. The site selection process includes a review of trade area demographics and an evaluation process. We may also rely on a franchisee s knowledge of the trade area and market characteristics when selecting a location for a
 franchised restaurant. A member of our development team visits each potential domestic restaurant location.

Development and Operations

New Unit Development 

We intend to expand the Pizza Inn system domestically and internationally in markets with significant long-term growth potential and where we believe we can use our
 competitive strengths to establish brand recognition and gain local market share. We plan to expand our Pizza Inn branded domestic restaurant base primarily through opening new franchised restaurants with new and existing franchisees. We expect
 to evaluate the continued development of new Pizza Inn Buffet and Delco Units in international markets in fiscal 2024, particularly in the Middle East.

The Company previously granted area developer rights for Pizza Inn restaurants in existing domestic markets. However, the Company is no longer pursuing such agreements. A
 Pizza Inn area developer typically paid a negotiated fee to purchase the right to operate or develop restaurants within a defined territory and agreed to a multi-restaurant development schedule. The area developer assisted us in local franchise
 service and quality control in exchange for half of the franchise fees and royalties from all restaurants within the territory during the term of the agreement.

3 

Index 

We intend to continue developing franchised Pie Five Units domestically. The rate at which we will be able to continue to expand the Pie Five concept through franchise
 development is determined in part by our success at selecting qualified franchisees, by our ability to identify satisfactory sites in appropriate markets, and by our ability to continue training and monitoring our franchisees. We intend to
 continue to focus on franchise development opportunities with experienced, well-capitalized restaurant operators.

Domestic Franchise Operations 

Franchise and development agreements. Since the Pizza Inn concept was first franchised in 1963, industry franchising concepts and
 development strategies have evolved, and our present franchise relationships are evidenced by a variety of contractual forms. Common to those forms are provisions that: (i) require the franchisee to follow the Pizza Inn system of restaurant
 operation and management, (ii) require the franchisee to pay a franchise fee, contribute a specified percentage of sales to a marketing fund managed by the Company, and pay continuing royalties, and (iii) except for Express Units, prohibit the
 development of one restaurant within a specified distance from another.

We launched the franchise program for Pie Five in fiscal 2013. Our Pie Five franchise agreement requires that the franchisees: (i) follow the Pie Five system of restaurant
 operation and management, (ii) pay a franchise fee and continuing royalties, (iii) contribute a specified percentage of sales to a marketing fund managed by the Company, and (iv) only open restaurants that comply with site and design standards
 determined by the Company.

Training. We offer numerous training programs for the benefit of franchisees and their restaurant crew managers. The training programs,
 taught by experienced Company employees, focus on food preparation, service, cost control, sanitation, safety, local store marketing, personnel management, and other aspects of restaurant operation. The training programs include group classes,
 supervised work in restaurants, and special field seminars. Initial and certain supplemental training programs are offered free of charge to franchisees, who pay their own travel and lodging expenses. New franchisees also receive on-site
 training from Company employees to assist with their first two restaurant openings under their development agreements. Restaurant managers train their staff through on-the-job training using video and printed materials produced by us.

Standards. We require franchisee adherence to a variety of standards designed to ensure proper operations and to protect and enhance the
 Pizza Inn and Pie Five brands. All franchisees are required to operate their restaurants in compliance with these written policies, standards, and specifications, which include matters such as menu items, ingredients, materials, supplies,
 services, furnishings, decor, and signs. Our efforts to maintain consistent operations may result, from time to time, in the closing of certain restaurants that have not maintained a consistent standard of quality or operations. We also maintain
 adherence to our standards through ongoing support and education of our franchisees by our franchise business consultants, who are deployed locally in markets where our franchisees are located.

Domestic Kiosk License Operations 

Kiosk license agreements. Our PIE Units are typically offered for five-year initial license periods with options for additional five year
 renewals. PIE Unit licensees are not charged development fees, license fees, royalties, or advertising assessments. PIE Unit license agreements require that the licensee comply with standards of the Pizza Inn brand, including marketing, kiosk
 system configuration, and sales and sourcing of authorized products and services. The mandated products and sourcing provisions within the PIE Unit licensing agreement result in supplier rebates for the Company.

Training. New licensees and their PIE Unit employees must attend and successfully complete our training program, which consists of a
 single day of training at the licensed location. PIE Unit managers train their staff through on-the-job training, using video and printed materials produced by us.

Standards. We require licensee adherence to a variety of standards designed to ensure proper operations and to protect and enhance the
 Pizza Inn brand. All licensees are required to operate their kiosks in compliance with these written policies, standards, and specifications, which include matters such as menu items, ingredients, materials, supplies, services, furnishings,
 decor, and signs. Our efforts to maintain consistent operations may result, from time to time, in the closing of certain kiosks that have not maintained a consistent standard of quality or operations. We also maintain adherence to our standards
 through ongoing support and education of our licensees by our franchise business consultants, who are deployed locally in markets where our licensees are located.

Company-Owned Restaurant Operations 

As of June 25, 2023 and June 26, 2022, we did not operate any Company-owned restaurants. We presently intend to open and operate Company-owned restaurants in the future.

4 

Index 

International Franchise Operations 

We also offer master license rights to develop Pizza Inn and Pie Five restaurants in certain foreign countries, with negotiated fees, development schedules, and ongoing
 royalties. A master licensee for a foreign country pays a negotiated fee to purchase the right to develop and operate restaurants within a defined territory, typically for a term of 20 years, plus a ten-year renewal option. The master licensee
 agrees to a multi-restaurant development schedule, and we train the master licensee to monitor and assist franchisees in their territory with local service and quality control with support from us. In return, the master licensee typically
 retains half the franchise fees and half the royalties on all restaurants within the territory during the term of the agreement. Master licensees may open restaurants that they own and operate, or they may open sub-franchised restaurants owned
 and operated by third parties through agreements with the master licensee subject to our approval.

Our first franchised Pizza Inn restaurant outside of the United States opened in the late 1970s. As of June 25, 2023, there were 34 Pizza Inn restaurants operating
 internationally. Except for three restaurants in Honduras and one restaurant in New Zealand, all of the Pizza Inn restaurants operated or sub-licensed by our international master licensees are in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and
 adjoining countries. Our ability to continue to develop select international markets is affected by a number of factors, including our ability to locate experienced, well-capitalized developers who can commit to an aggressive multi-restaurant
 development schedule and achieve maximum initial market penetration with minimal supervision by us.

Food and Supply Distribution

Our franchisees and licensees purchase food and supplies directly from authorized, reputable, and experienced supply and distribution companies. The Company provides
 sourcing, quality assurance, and research and development for both the Pizza Inn and Pie Five systems. The authorized distributors make deliveries to all domestic units from several distribution centers, with delivery territories and
 responsibilities for each determined according to geographical region. As a franchisor, the Company is able to leverage the advantages of direct vendor negotiations and volume purchasing of food, equipment, and supplies for the franchisees and
 licensees benefit in the form of a concentrated, one-truck delivery system, competitive pricing, and product consistency. Franchisees and licensees are able to source all products and ingredients from authorized distributors. In order to
 assure product quality and consistency, our franchisees and licensees are required to purchase from authorized distributors certain food products that are proprietary to the Pizza Inn and Pie Five systems, including cheese, pizza sauce, flour
 mixture, certain meats, and spice blend. Franchisees and licensees may purchase other non-proprietary food products and supplies either from authorized distributors or from other suppliers who meet our requirements for quality and reliability.

Non-proprietary food and ingredients, equipment and other supplies are generally available from several qualified sources. With the exception of several proprietary food
 products, such as cheese and dough flour, we are not dependent upon any one supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We contract with established food processors for the production of our proprietary products according to our specifications.

We have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories, restaurant supplies, or products, but disruption of
 supply chains or other factors could cause difficulty in obtaining inventories or supplies in the future. Prices charged by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation, and franchisees and licensees bear increased costs or benefit from savings
 through changes in product pricing. We do not engage in commodity hedging but enter into pricing arrangements for up to a year in advance for certain high-volume products.

Marketing and Advertising

By communicating a common brand message at the regional, local market, and restaurant levels, we believe we can create and reinforce a strong, consistent marketing message to
 consumers and increase our market share. We offer or facilitate several ways for the brand image and message to be promoted at the local and regional levels.

Pizza Inn and Pie Five franchisees contribute a specified percentage of their sales to the Company to fund the creation and production of various marketing and advertising
 programs and materials, which may include print and digital advertisements, direct mail materials, customer satisfaction systems, social media and e-mail marketing, television and radio commercials, in-store promotional materials, marketing and
 public relations services, and consumer research. We anticipate continuing to optimize Pizza Inn and Pie Five marketing activities commensurate with the contributions of the marketing funds.

Pizza Inn and Pie Five franchisees are required to conduct independent marketing efforts in addition to their participation in the national marketing programs for each
 brand. We provide franchised restaurants with access to an assortment of local store marketing materials, including pre-approved print, radio, and digital media marketing materials. We also provide local store marketing materials and programs
 specifically to support new restaurant openings.

Trademarks and Quality Control

We own various trademarks, including the names Pizza Inn and Pie Five, that are used in connection with the restaurants and have been registered with the United States
 Patent and Trademark Office. The duration of our trademarks is unlimited, subject to periodic renewal and continued use. In addition, we have obtained trademark registrations for our marks in several foreign countries and have periodically
 re-filed and applied for registration in others. We believe that we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks essential to our business.

Government Regulation

We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our restaurants. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and
 regulation by several governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, wage and hour, alcoholic beverage, building and fire agencies in the state and municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining,
 or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or require the temporary or permanent closing of an existing restaurant in a particular area.

We are subject to Federal Trade Commission FTC regulations and to various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires us to furnish to
 prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a number of states, and bills have been introduced in
 Congress from time to time that would provide for further federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the
 franchisor-franchisee relationship.

Employees

As of June 25, 2023, we had 25 full-time employees. None of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Industry and Competition

The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location, and food quality, and there are many well-established competitors with
 substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than the Company. Competitors include a number of international, national, and regional restaurant and pizza chains, as well as local restaurants and pizza operators. 
 Some of our competitors may be better established in the markets where our restaurants are or may be located. Within the pizza segment of the restaurant industry, we believe that our primary competitors are national pizza chains and several
 regional chains. We also compete against the frozen pizza products available at grocery stores and large superstore retailers. In recent years, several competitors have developed fast-casual pizza concepts that compete with Pie Five in certain
 metropolitan areas. A change in the pricing or other market strategies of one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings.

With respect to the sale of franchises and licenses, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. We believe that the principal competitive
 factors affecting the sale of franchises are product quality, price, value, consumer acceptance, franchisor experience and support, and the quality of the relationship maintained between the franchisor and its franchisees. In general, there is
 active competition for management personnel and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for our restaurants.

PROPERTIES.

The Company leases its 19,576 square foot corporate office facility with average annual lease payments of approximately 18.00 per square foot. This lease began on January 2,
 2017 and has a ten-year term. The Company amended its lease agreement in June 2020 and elected to defer one-half of the monthly base rent for the period from June 2020 through May 2021.

As of June 25, 2023, the Company had contingent and direct lease obligations for eight additional restaurant locations. Two of the lease obligations have been subleased and
 six of the lease obligations have been assigned to franchisees. These leased properties range in size from 2,025 to 3,000 square feet, have annual rental rates ranging from approximately 30.00 to 42.00 per square foot and expire between 2023
 and 2028.

ITEM 3. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On January 6, 2020, the Company s former Chief Executive Officer, Scott Crane, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging various claims in connection with
 the Company s termination of his employment in July 2019. In general, the suit asserted that the Company terminated Crane for the purpose of depriving him of certain equity compensation that otherwise would have been due to him on October 15,
 2019. The Company asserted that Crane failed to meet the contractual qualifications for the equity, as well as other defenses. The matter proceeded to trial which resulted in a verdict in favor of Crane, and the trial court entered judgment in
 Crane s favor. The Company appealed the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on May 31, 2023 issued an opinion reversing the trial court and rendering judgment in favor of the Company on all claims brought by Crane, and returning
 the matter to the trial court for consideration of costs and attorney fees to be awarded to the Company as the prevailing party in the litigation.

The Company is subject to other claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that all such claims and actions currently pending
 against it are either adequately covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s annual results of operations, cash flows or financial condition if decided in a manner that is unfavorable to the Company.

COVID-19 Pandemic

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and the disease spread rapidly throughout the United
 States and the world. Federal, state and local responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our internal efforts to protect customers, franchisees, and employees, severely disrupted our business operations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic
 precipitated significant job losses and a national economic downturn that impacted the demand for restaurant food service.

Although most of our domestic restaurants continued to operate under these conditions, we have experienced temporary closures from time to time during the pandemic. During
 much of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced dramatically reduced aggregate in-store retail sales at Buffet Units and Pie Five Units, modestly offset by increased aggregate carry-out and delivery sales. The decreased aggregate retail sales
 correspondingly decreased supplier rebates and franchise royalties payable to the Company.

In most cases, in-store dining has now resumed subject to seating capacity limitations, social distancing protocols, and/or enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices. As a
 result, the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have diminished in recent periods. Nonetheless, an outbreak or perceived outbreak of COVID-19 connected to restaurant dining could cause negative publicity directed at any of our brands and
 cause customers to avoid our restaurants. Therefore, despite the official end of the pandemic, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our future results of operations and liquidity cannot presently be predicted.

Pizza Inn total domestic retail sales increased by 12.4 million, or 14.1 compared to the prior year. The increase in domestic retail sales was primarily the result of the
 diminished impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement. Pizza Inn domestic comparable store retail sales increased by 9.8 million, or 11.3 , for the same reason.

The net decrease of five domestic units was primarily due to declines in Delco and PIE units. We believe that this trend of net domestic store closures is moderating and
 will reverse in future periods. The net increase of three international Pizza Inn units was due to new units in the Middle East and New Zealand.

 decrease in domestic retail sales was primarily the result of lower store count. Comparable store retail sales increased by 1.0 million, or 5.4 during fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. The improvement in comparable store retail
 sales was primarily the result of the diminished impact of COVID-19 and increased customer engagement.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms

The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). However, the Company also presents and
 discusses certain non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. Management may also use such non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the effectiveness of business strategies and for
 planning and budgeting purposes. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as an alternative or substitute for the results reflected in the Company s GAAP financial statements.

We consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of operating performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors, and other
 parties interested in our industry. We believe that EBITDA is helpful to investors in evaluating our results of operations without the impact of expenses affected by financing methods, accounting methods and the tax environment. We believe that
 Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors by excluding non-operational or non-recurring expenses to provide a measure of operating performance that is more comparable from period to period. Management also uses these
 non-GAAP financial measures for evaluating operating performance, assessing the effectiveness of business strategies, projecting future capital needs, budgeting and other planning purposes.

The following key performance indicators presented herein, some of which represent non-GAAP financial measures, have the meaning and are calculated as follows:

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, severance, gain/loss on sale of assets, costs related to impairment and other
 lease charges, franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense, and closed and non-operating store costs.

Retail sales represents the restaurant sales reported by our franchisees and Company-owned restaurants, which may be segmented by brand or domestic/international locations.

Comparable store retail sales includes the retail sales for restaurants that have been open for at least 18 months as of the end of the reporting period. The sales results for a restaurant that was closed
 temporarily for remodeling or relocation within the same trade area are included in the calculation only for the days that the restaurant was open in both periods being compared.

Store weeks represent the total number of full weeks that specified restaurants were open during the period.

Average units open reflects the number of restaurants open during a reporting period weighted by the percentage of the weeks in a reporting period that each restaurant was open.

Average weekly sales for a specified period is calculated as total retail sales (excluding partial weeks) divided by store weeks in the period.

Restaurant operating cash flow represents the pre-tax income earned by Company-owned restaurants before (1) allocated marketing and advertising expenses, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) impairment
 and other lease charges, and (4) non-operating store costs.

Non-operating store costs represent gain or loss on asset disposal, store closure expenses, lease termination expenses and expenses related to abandoned store sites.

Franchisee default and closed store revenue/expense represents the net of accelerated revenues and costs attributable to defaulted area development agreements and closed franchised stores.

Revenues:

Revenues are derived from franchise royalties, franchise fees and supplier and distributer incentives, advertising funds, area development exclusivity fees and foreign master
 license fees, supplier convention funds, sublease rental income, interest and other income, and sales by Company-owned restaurants. The volume of supplier incentive revenues is dependent on the level of chain-wide retail sales, which are impacted
 by changes in comparable store sales and restaurant count, as well as the products sold to franchisees through third-party food distributors. Total revenues for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 11.9 million and 10.7 million, respectively.

Pizza Inn Franchise and License Revenues 

Pizza Inn franchise revenues increased by 1.3 million to 9.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared to 8.5 million in fiscal 2022. The 14.9 increase was primarily the result of
 an increase in store count, effective marketing campaigns, and a reduction in the impact of COVID-19.

Pie Five Franchise and License Revenues 

Pie Five franchise revenues decreased by 0.1 million to 1.9 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 2.0 million for fiscal 2022. The 4.1 decrease was primarily the result of
 lower store count.

Restaurant Sales 

We had no restaurant sales, which consist of revenue generated by Company-owned restaurants, in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022 because we closed our single remaining
 Company-owned restaurant during the third quarter of fiscal 2020.

Costs and Expenses:

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales primarily includes food and supply costs, labor costs, and lease costs directly related to Company-owned restaurant sales. These costs decreased to zero for
 fiscal 2023 compared to 1 thousand in fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily the result of the closure of the remaining Company-owned stores during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 partially offset by ongoing lease costs directly related to
 closed Company-owned stores.

General and Administrative Expenses 

Total general and administrative expenses increased to 5.5 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 5.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The 44 thousand,
 or 0.8 , increase in total general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased corporate expenses related to a decrease in miscellaneous income offset by a decrease in legal fees.

14 

Index 

Franchise Expenses 

Franchise expenses include general and administrative expenses directly related to the sale and continuing service of domestic and international franchises. Total franchise
 expenses increased 0.7 million to 4.0 million in fiscal 2023 from 3.3 million in the prior fiscal year. Pizza Inn franchise expenses increased 0.8 million to 3.1 million in fiscal 2023 compared to 2.3 million in the prior fiscal year
 primarily as a result of an increase in payroll and related, advertising, and travel costs. Pie Five franchise expenses decreased 0.1 million to 0.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to 1.0 million in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result
 of lower store count.

Impairment Expenses 

Impairment of long-lived assets and other lease charges were 5 thousand for fiscal 2023 compared to 6 thousand for fiscal 2022. Impairment of long-lived assets and other
 lease charges for Company-owned restaurants of zero in fiscal 2023 remained essentially unchanged from the prior year.

Bad Debt Expense 

The Company monitors franchisee receivable balances and adjusts credit terms when necessary to minimize the Company s exposure to high risk accounts receivable. Bad debt
 expense increased by 27 thousand to 73 thousand in fiscal 2023 compared to 46 thousand in fiscal 2022 primarily related to collectability concerns on international accounts receivable.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased 60 thousand for fiscal 2023 to 1 thousand compared to 61 thousand in the prior year.

Amortization and Depreciation Expense 

Amortization and depreciation expense increased 27 thousand to 214 thousand in fiscal 2023 compared to 187 thousand in fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of higher
 amortization of intangible assets.

Other Income 

Other income represents non-recurring income that is not derived from the operations of the Company. The Company had a 0.7 million refundable employee retention tax credit during fiscal 2022
 which was the result of governmental actions to mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. (See, Liquidity and Capital Resources Employee Retention Credit below.) Management does not presently expect similar benefits to be
 available in subsequent periods.

Provision for Income Tax 

For the year ended June 25, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 0.5 million. The federal and state tax expense was 0.4 million and 0.1
 million, respectively. The Company utilized net operating losses to offset federal taxes. For the year ended June 26, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of 5.7 million including federal deferred tax benefit of 5.5 million and
 current/deferred state tax benefit of 0.2 million. As of June 25, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling 21 million that are available to reduce future taxable income and will begin to expire in 2035. Under
 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, approximately 1.4 million of the loss carryforwards are limited to 80 and do not expire. Tax years that remain subject to examination by the IRS are the years ended June 28, 2020 through June 26, 2022. Tax
 years that remain subject to examination by state authorities are the years ended June 30, 2019 through June 26, 2022.

The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable
 temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Future sources of
 taxable income are also considered in determining the amount of the recorded valuation allowance. Based on this analysis, the Company reversed the full amount of the established valuation allowance as of June 26, 2022.

There are no uncertain tax positions. Management s position is that all relevant requirements are met and necessary returns have been filed, and therefore the tax positions taken on the tax
 returns would be sustained upon examination.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Funds

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, loan proceeds, and proceeds from the sale of securities.

15 

Index 

Cash flows from operating activities generally reflect net income adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, changes in deferred taxes,
 share based compensation, and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operations was 2.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to cash provided by operations of 1.4 million in fiscal 2022.

Cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect net proceeds from sale of assets and capital expenditures for the purchase of Company assets. Cash used
 in investing activities was 15 thousand in fiscal 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 0.3 million in fiscal 2022. The 0.3 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily the result of
 decreased payments on notes receivable from prior sales of assets.

Cash flows from financing activities generally reflect changes in the Company s borrowings and securities activity during the period. Net cash used in
 financing activities was 5.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2023 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2.3 million for the fiscal year June 26, 2022. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was
 primarily the result of 5.0 million used to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. The cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to the retirement of all outstanding convertible notes, the repurchase
 of the Company s common stock, and the repayment of a short term loan.

Employee Retention Credit

On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CAA was signed into law. The CAA expanded eligibility for an employee retention credit for companies impacted by the
 COVID-19 pandemic with fewer than five hundred employees and at least a twenty percent decline in gross receipts compared to the same quarter in 2019, to encourage retention of employees. This payroll tax credit was a refundable tax credit
 against certain federal employment taxes. For the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, the Company recorded 0.7 million of other income for the employee retention credit. The Company has also benefitted from the CAA guidance to treat expenses
 associated with the PPP loan forgiveness as tax deductible.

Convertible Notes

On March 3, 2017, the Company completed a registered shareholder rights offering of its 4 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2022 Notes ). Shareholders exercised subscription
 rights to purchase all 30,000 of the Notes at the par value of 100 per Note, resulting in gross offering proceeds to the Company of 3.0 million.

The Notes bore interest at the rate of 4 per annum on the principal or par value of 100 per note, payable annually in arrears on February 15 of each year, commencing
 February 15, 2018. Interest was payable in cash or, at the Company s discretion, in shares of Company common stock. The Notes were secured by a pledge of all outstanding equity securities of our two primary direct operating subsidiaries. During
 the fiscal year ended June 26, 2022, no Notes were converted to common shares. The Notes matured on February 15, 2022, at which time all principal and unpaid interest was paid in cash. Therefore, as of June 25, 2023 and June 26, 2022, there were
 no Notes outstanding.

Liquidity

We expect to fund continuing operations and planned capital expenditures for the next fiscal year primarily from cash on hand and operating cash flow. Based on budgeted and
 year-to-date cash flow information, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for the 2024 fiscal year and beyond.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of
 assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates
 and assumptions are reviewed periodically. Actual results could differ materially from estimates.

The Company believes the following critical accounting policies require estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, are susceptible to change, and
 therefore require subjective judgments. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition in future periods.

Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables generated from franchise royalties and supplier concessions. The Company records a provision for doubtful receivables to
 allow for any amounts which may be unrecoverable based upon an analysis of the Company s prior collection experience, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends. Actual realization of accounts receivable could differ materially from
 the Company s estimates.

16 

Index 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is
 evaluated based on the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from use and eventual disposition of the assets compared to their carrying value. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of an impaired asset is
 reduced to its fair value, based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of 5 thousand and 6 thousand during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had 0.2 million in
 sublease income during fiscal 2023 and 2022.

Franchise revenue consists of income from license fees, royalties, area development and foreign master license agreements, advertising fund revenues, supplier incentive and
 convention contribution revenues. Franchise fees, area development and foreign master license agreement fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the related contract agreement. Royalties and advertising fund
 revenues, which are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales, are recognized as income as retail sales occur. Supplier incentive revenues are recognized as earned, typically as the underlying commodities are shipped.

The Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable
 temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Future sources of
 taxable income are also considered in determining the amount of the recorded valuation allowance. Based on this analysis, the Company reversed the full amount of the established valuation allowance as of June 26, 2022.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present,
 and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. ASC 740-10 requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a more likely
 than not threshold, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of
 being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of June 25, 2023 and June 26, 2022, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.

The Company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies from legal matters based upon factors such as the current status of the cases and consultations with external counsel
 and provides for the exposure by accruing an amount if it is judged to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. If the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate, operating results could be adversely impacted.

Leases 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement. To the extent that it can be determined that an arrangement represents a lease, it is classified as either an
 operating lease or a finance lease. The Company does not currently have any finance leases. The Company capitalizes operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets through a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. Right of use
 assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Short-term leases that have an initial term of one year or
 less are not capitalized. The Company does not presently have any short-term leases.

Operating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of an arrangement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In addition to the
 present value of lease payments, the operating lease right of use asset also includes any lease payments made to the lessor prior to lease commencement less any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for operating lease
 payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Rave Restaurant Group, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rave Restaurant Group, Inc and subsidiaries (the Company as of June 25, 2023,
 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present
 fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 25, 2023, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
 statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
 federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
 reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
 reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial
 reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
 fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
 communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical
 audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or
 disclosures to which it relates

Assessment of Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets 

Critical Audit Matter Description

As disclosed in Note A and Note F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes deferred income taxes for tax attributes and
 for differences between the financial statement and tax carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the deferred tax liability or asset are expected to be settled or realized. The
 Company continually reviews the realizability of its deferred tax assets, including an analysis of factors such as future taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for
 the valuation allowance, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Future sources of taxable income are also considered in determining the amount of the recorded
 valuation allowance. As of June 25, 2023, the Company has deferred tax assets of approximately 5.3 million. Auditing management s assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets involved subjective estimation and complex auditor judgment in
 determining whether sufficient future taxable income, including projected pre-tax income, will be generated to support the realization of the existing deferred tax assets before expiration.

How We Addressed the Matter

We evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income, including the pre-tax income, by income tax
 jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the projections. For example, we compared the projections of pre-tax income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management s consideration of
 current industry and economic trends. We also compared the projections of future pre-tax income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company.

With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated the methodology and models used in management s forecasting of the reversal of
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities in order to determine such methodologies were consistent with GAAP, including management s consideration of definite-lived deferred income tax balances and indefinite-lived deferred income tax balances.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2023.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 26, 2022 and June 27, 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit
 matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that
 are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
 financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition Refer to Note A to the Financial Statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company has two
 primary sources of revenues: restaurant sales and franchise revenues. Franchise revenues consist of 1) franchise royalties, 2) supplier and distributor incentive revenues, 3) franchise license fees, 4) area development exclusivity fees and
 foreign master license fees, 5) advertising funds, and 6) supplier convention funds. Each of these sources of revenues have different contract types, lengths, terms, and conditions. As such, revenue recognition requires significant analysis and a
 high degree of auditor judgment.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company s revenue recognition included the following:

We obtained the detail of all revenue transactions and performed the following procedures:

o

Identified the Company s various revenue streams and any differences in the processes, methods, and policies applicable to each revenue
 stream.

o

Reviewed the entity s revenue recognition policies and evaluated whether following those policies comply with the requirements of ASC
 606.
