Item
1 Business 

(a)
Business Development 

George
Risk Industries, Inc. (GRI or the Company) was incorporated in 1967 in Colorado. The Company is presently engaged in the design, manufacture,
and sale of custom computer keyboards, proximity switches, security alarm components and systems, pool access alarms, EZ Duct wire covers,
water sensors, electronic switching devices, high security switches and wire and cable installation tools. 

Products,
Market, and Distribution 

The
Company designs, manufactures, and sells computer keyboards, proximity switches, security alarm components and systems, pool access alarms,
water sensors, electronic switching devices, high security switches, and wire and cable installation tools. The Security sales division,
which concentrates on selling products for security purposes, comprises approximately 96.6 of net revenues and these goods are sold
to distributors and alarm dealers/installers. 

The
security segment has approximately 1,000 current customers. One of the distributors, Ademco, Inc. (previously known as ADI), accounts
for approximately 35.8 of the Company s sales of these products. Anixter, Inc. accounts for another 24.2 of the security segment
of the Company sales. The loss of these distributors would be significant to the Company. However, both companies have purchased from
the Company for many years and are expected to continue. Also, the Company has a written agreement with Ademco. This agreement was signed
in February 2011 and was initiated by the customer. The contents of the agreement include product terms, purchasing, payment terms, term
and termination, product marketing, representations and warranties, product support, mutual confidentiality, indemnification and insurance,
and general provisions. 

2 

The
keyboard and proximity switch segment has approximately 300 customers. These products are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers
to their specifications and to distributors of off-the-shelf keyboards of proprietary design. 

Competition 

The
Company has intense competition in the keyboard/proximity and security/burglar alarm lines. 

The
security/burglar alarm segment has approximately six major competitors. The Company competes well based on price, product design, quality,
customization and having products made in the USA. 

The
competitors in the keyboard/proximity segment are larger companies with automated production facilities. GRI has emphasized small custom
order sales that many of its competitors decline or discourage. 

Research
and Development 

The
Company performs research and development for its customers when needed and as requested. Costs in connection with such product development
have been borne by the customers. Costs associated with the development of new products are expensed as incurred. The Company also does
R D for itself to help in the development of new products. 

Employees 

GRI
has approximately 175 employees. 

Item
2 Properties 

The
Company owns the manufacturing and the office facilities that it operates in. Total square footage of the plant in Kimball, Nebraska
is approximately 50,000 sq. ft. A 7,500 sq. ft. warehouse for raw material storage was purchased in June 2017 when the Company acquired
its cable and wiring segment and another 9,600 sq. ft. building was purchased in April 2020 for additional expansion. Additionally, the
Company purchased the 15,000 sq. ft. building that it previously leased from Bonita Risk, which has been used mainly for offices, in
November 2019. Bonita Risk is a director of the Company. 

The
Company also owns a building in Gering, NE that is 7,200 sq. ft. in size. This is used for manufacturing. Currently, there are approximately
34 employees at the Gering site.

Item
7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive
Overview 

George
Risk Industries, Inc. (GRI) (the Company is a diversified manufacturer of electronic components, encompassing the security
industry s widest variety of door and window contact switches, environmental products, wire and cable installation tools, proximity
switches and custom keyboards. The security products division comprises the largest portion of GRI sales and products are sold worldwide
through distributors, who in turn sell these products to security installation companies. These products are used for residential, commercial,
industrial and government installations. International sales accounted for approximately 11.1 of revenues for fiscal year 2023 and 10.7 
for 2022. 

GRI
is known for its quality American made products, top-notch customer service and the willingness to work with customers on their special
applications. 

GRI
owns and operates its main manufacturing plant and offices in Kimball, Nebraska with a satellite plant 40 miles away in Gering, Nebraska. 

The
Company has substantial marketable securities holdings and these holdings have a material impact on the financial results. For the fiscal
year ending April 30, 2023, the percentage of other income (expense) was a gain of 12.98 of income before income taxes. In comparison,
for the year ending April 30, 2022, the percentage of other income (expense) was a loss of 30.11 of the income before income taxes.
Management s philosophy behind having holdings in marketable securities is to keep the money working and to gain interest on the
cash that is not needed to be put back into the business. Over the years, the investments have kept the earnings per share up when the
results from operations have not fared as well. 

Management
is always open to the possibility of acquiring a business that would complement our existing operations, which is exactly what took place
in October 2017 when the Company purchased substantially all of the assets from Labor Saving Devices, Inc. LSDI and Roy
Bowling Bowling ). 

There
are no known seasonal trends with any of GRI s products, since the Company mostly sells to distributors and original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs). The products are tied to the housing industry and will fluctuate with building trends. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Operating 

Net
cash decreased by 1,135,000 during the year ended April 30, 2023 compared to a decrease of 1,248,000 during the year ended April 30,
2022. Accounts receivable decreased by 627,000 during the current year while showing a 326,000 increase in the prior year. The current
decrease in cash flow from accounts receivable is the result of a combination of slightly faster collection of accounts receivable and
decreased sales. At April 30, 2023, 79.90 of receivables were less than 60 days and 4.95 were over 90 days. In comparison, 75.19 of
the receivables were considered current (less than 60 days) and 7.86 of the total were over 90 days past due for the prior year during
the same period. 

6 

Inventories
increased by 3,604,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, while the prior year showed an increase of 2,430,000 at year end. The
current year increase is a result of having more raw materials on hand since sales had increased previously and having the raw material
costing more than before. In turn, with material and labor costs rising, the work in process and finished goods inventories have also
increased. 

Prepaid
expenses decreased by 761,000 while they increased 903,000 in the current and prior year, respectively. The current year decrease is
due to not having as many prepayments of raw materials than at year-end last year and not having to renew multi-year subscriptions in
the current year. 

Income
tax overpayment increased by 680,000 for the year ended April 30, 2023, compared to a 196,000 increase in income tax payable for the
year ended April 30, 2022. The current increase is largely due to having slightly lower sales and income before tax and not making larger
income tax estimates than last year. 

For
the year ended April 30, 2023, accounts payable increased by 226,000 as compared to a decrease of 157,000 for the same period the year
before. The change in cash with regards to accounts payable is largely based on timing. Payables are paid within terms and fluctuate
based primarily on inventory needs for production. Accrued expenses increased 111,000 for the year ended April 30, 2023, due to having
significantly more accrued customer liability refund calculated compared to the prior year. 

Investing 

As
for investment activities, 548,000 was spent on purchases of property and equipment during the current fiscal year, compared to 390,000
during the year ended April 30, 2022 These capitalized costs mainly consisted of purchases of machinery and equipment and making capital
improvements. Additionally, the Company continues to purchase marketable securities, which include municipal bonds and quality stocks.
Cash spent on purchases of marketable securities for the year ended April 30, 2023 was 764,000 versus the 787,000 spent for the corresponding
period last year. Conversely, net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities were 25,000 and 452,000 at April 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The Company uses money manager accounts for most stock transactions. By doing this, the Company gives an
independent third-party firm, who are experts in this field, permission to buy and sell stocks at will. The Company pays quarterly service
fees based on the value of the investments. 

Financing 

Cash
used in financing activities consists of two items. First, for the year ended April 30, 2023, 2,689,000 was spent on the payment of
dividends. The Company declared a dividend of 0.60 per share of common stock on September 30, 2022 for the current fiscal year, while
a 0.50 per share of common stock dividend was declared on September 30, 2021 and issued in the prior fiscal year. Second, the Company
continues to purchase back its Class A common stock when the opportunity arises. For the year ended April 30, 2023, the Company purchased
 7,000 of treasury stock and 211,000 was bought back for the year ended April 30, 2022. In an effort to repurchase its Class A Common
Stock, the Company has been actively searching for stockholders that have been lost over the years. 

At
April 30, 2023, working capital increased 3.28 in comparison to the previous fiscal year. The Company measures liquidity using the quick
ratio, which is the ratio of cash, securities and accounts receivables to current obligations. The Company s quick ratio decreased
to 14.648 for the year ended April 30, 2023 compared to 15.549 for the year ended April 30, 2022.

Results
of Operations 

GRI
completed the fiscal year ending April 30, 2023 with a net profit of 23.81 of net sales. Net sales were at 19,979,000, down 3.65 over
the previous fiscal year. The decrease in sales is a result of a slowing economy which has seen inflation grow to some of its highest
levels in the last 15 years. Cost of goods sold was 53.08 of net sales for the year ended April 30, 2023 and 51.70 for the same period
last year. Management aims to keep the cost of goods sold percentage within 50 and was just slightly over that percentage for the current
fiscal year. Management strives to be as efficient as possible since wages and material costs continue to increase, due to the increased
inflation in our economy. Management offset some of these added expenses by implementing a 10 price increase effective January 1, 2023. 

Operating
expenses were 21.59 of net sales for the year ended April 30, 2023 as compared to 21.06 for the corresponding period last year. Management s
goal is to keep the operating expenses around 30 or less of net sales, so the goal has been met for the current fiscal year. Income
from operations for the year ended April 30, 2023 was at 5,060,000, which is a 10.41 decrease from the corresponding period last year,
which had income from operations of 5,648,000. 

Other
income and expense results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 produced a gain of 755,000. This is in comparison to a loss of 1,307,000
for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. Dividend and interest income was 1,068,000, which is up 3.99 over the prior year. Dividend
and interest income at April 30, 2022 was 1,027,000. Investments in marketable securities are presented at fair value and an unrealized
gain or loss is recorded within the statements of operations, a non-cash entry. As a result, an unrealized loss of 31,000 was recorded
for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and an unrealized loss of 2,764,000 was recorded for the prior year ended April 30, 2022. Net
loss on the sale of investments for the current fiscal year was 291,000, which is a 170.29 decrease over the net gain on the sale of
investments of 414,000 for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. 

Net
income for the year ended April 30, 2023 was 4,757,000, which is up 33.40 from the prior year, which produced net income of 3,566,000.
Basic and diluted earnings per common share EPS for the year ended April 30, 2023 was 0.96 per share. Basic and diluted
EPS for the year ended April 30, 2022 was 0.72 per share. 

Management
is hopeful that sales will increase for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2024. Opportunities for Management include focusing on finding
ways to get our products out to our customers in a timelier manner. One way we are doing this is by looking into more automation. Challenges
facing Management include obtaining certain raw materials and the increased costs of most raw materials because of inflation. The Company
also struggles to get enough workers to fill production needs. Our Security sales division, which is our largest sales generator, is
directly tied to the housing industry and we normally experience the same fluctuations. We are always researching and developing new
products that will help our sales increase. There were a few new or improved products that were successfully launched in fiscal year
2023, and we are confident that more new products will be released soon, and we are searching for products that complement our current
offerings. Management is always open to the possibility of acquiring a business or product line that would complement our existing operations.
Due to the Company s strong cash position, management believes this could be achieved without the need for outside financing. The
intent is to utilize the equipment, marketing techniques and established customers to deliver new products and increase sales and profits. 

8 

New
product development 

The
GRI Engineering department continues to develop enhancements to our existing products as well as to develop new products that will continue
to secure our position in the industry. 

Explosion
proof contacts that will be UL listed for hazardous locations are in development. There has been demand from our customers for this type
of high security magnetic reed switch. 

The
Company is developing magnetic contacts which are listed under UL 634 Level 2. These sensors are for high security applications such
as government buildings, military use, nuclear facilities, and financial institutions. 

Research
is being done on updating our small profile glass break detector, in addition to looking at development of programmable temperature and
humidity sensors with built-in hysteresis. 

Wireless
technology is a main area of focus for product development. We are considering adding wireless technology to some of our current products.
A wireless contact switch is in the final stages of development. Also, we are working on wireless versions of monitoring devices which
include glass break detection, tilt sensing and environmental monitoring. A redesign of our brass water valve shut-off system is near
completion. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements, which have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported
in those financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those
estimates. The most critical accounting policies relate to accounts receivable; marketable securities; inventory; income taxes; and segment
reporting. 

Accounts
receivable Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company sells its products to security
alarm distributors, alarm installers, and original equipment manufacturers. Management performs continuing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and the Company generally does not require collateral. 

The
Company records an allowance for credit losses based on an analysis of specifically identified customer balances. The Company has a limited
number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given date. Any unanticipated change in any one of these customers 
credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on the
results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
receivable is written off. 

9 

Marketable
securities The Company has investments in publicly traded equity securities, state and municipal debt securities, and real-estate
investment trusts (REITs). The investments in securities are reported at fair value. The Company uses the average cost method to determine
the cost of securities sold and any unrealized gains or losses on equity securities are reported in the respective period s earnings.
Unrealized gains and losses on debt securities are excluded from earnings and reported separately as a component of stockholder s
equity. Dividend and interest income are reported as earned. 

In
accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (US GAAP), the Company evaluates all marketable securities
for other-than temporary declines in fair value. When the cost basis exceeds the fair market value for approximately one year, management
evaluates the nature of the investment, cause of impairment and number of investments that are in an unrealized loss position. When it
is determined that a security will likely remain impaired, a recognized loss is booked and the investment is written down to its new
fair value. The investments are periodically evaluated to determine if impairment changes are required. 

Inventories Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs are determined using the average cost-pricing method. The Company uses
actual costs to price its manufactured inventories, approximating average costs. The reported net value of inventory includes finished
saleable products, work-in-process and raw materials that will be sold or used in future periods. Inventory costs include raw materials,
direct labor and overhead. The Company s overhead expenses are applied, based in part, upon estimates of the proportion of those
expenses that are related to procuring and storing raw materials as compared to the manufacture and assembly of finished products. These
proportions, the method of their application, and the resulting overhead included in ending inventory, are based in part on subjective
estimates and approximations and actual results could differ from those estimates. 

In
addition, the Company records an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the cost of the inventory that has had no movement
in over two years. There is inherent professional judgment and subjectivity made by management in determining the estimated obsolescence
percentage. In addition, and as necessary, the Company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events. 

Income
Taxes US GAAP requires use of the assets and liability method; whereby current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on tax rates and laws enacted as of the balance sheet date. Deferred tax expense represents the change in the deferred
tax asset/liability balances. 

Segment
Reporting and Related Information The Company designates the internal organization that is used by management for allocating
resources and assessing performance as the source of the Company s reportable segments. US GAAP also requires disclosures about
products and services, geographic area, and major customers.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders
of George Risk Industries, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of George Risk Industries, Inc. (the Company) as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Critical
Audit Matter Revenue Recognition Refer to Note 1 of the Financial Statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The
Company primarily generates revenue through non-complex sales transactions that require limited judgement. However, there are instances
in which revenue contracts contain complexities that are subject to critical judgment around when the performance obligation is satisfied.
These specific elements of revenue are variable considerations, returns and allowances. 

Consideration
in contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as discounts, rebates, and allowances. Accordingly, revenues
are recorded net of estimated variable consideration, returns and allowances, based on known or expected values. 

This
matter was considered a critical audit matter as there is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluation of
audit evidence related to contractual terms in customer arrangements to determine the amounts of consideration. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal procedures related to the Company s revenue recognition for these specific elements are the following: 

We
 evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to various elements of revenue recognition. 

We
 performed analytical procedures to test the reasonableness of recorded balances. 

For
 a sample of transactions, we inspected source documents, including customer contracts or purchase orders, third-party shipping information,
 invoices, and relevant communication. 

Evaluated
 contractual terms in customer arrangements that impact management determination of the variable consideration related to the productions
 and related recognition of revenue on a sample basis. 

Critical
Audit Matter Valuation of Investments Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of the Financial Statements 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The
company has investments in publicly traded equity securities, state and municipal debt securities, REITS, and money markets and they
are recorded at fair value. Some of these investments are Level 2 investments and can be hard to value. In addition, as the securities
held at fair value, management must assess securities that are in a significant unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment.
For these securities, management must make difficult and subjective judgements about the ability of the issuer to be able to meet its
obligations under terms of the security. These judgements can have a significant impact on the Company s reported earnings if they
should prove to be significantly inaccurate. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal procedures related to the Company s process for debt securities valuations as well as the process for equity securities
other than temporary impairment evaluation included are the following: 

We
 evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to the identification of other than temporary impairment. 

Valuation
 specialists, with specialized skills and knowledge, were involved in the assessment of the fair values for a sample of Level 2 investments. 

We
 performed testing over a sample of securities to determine if conclusions reached by management regarding other than temporary impairment
 were appropriate. 

/s/

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 1992.

Marketable
securities that are classified as equity securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded
as an unrealized gain or (loss) in the statements of income in the period of the change. Upon the disposition of a marketable security,
the Company records a realized gain or (loss) on the Company s statements of income. 

The
Company evaluates all investments for other-than temporary declines in fair value, which are defined as when the cost basis exceeds the
fair value for approximately one year. The Company also evaluates the nature of the investment, cause of impairment and number of investments
that are in an unrealized position. When other than a temporary decline is identified, the Company will decrease the cost of the investment
to the new fair value and recognize a loss. The investments are periodically evaluated to determine if impairment changes are required.
As a result of this standard, management recorded an impairment loss of for the year ended April 30, 2023, but did no t have to
record any impairment losses for the year ended April 30, 2022. 

The
Company s investments are actively traded in the stock and bond markets. Therefore, there is either a realized gain or loss that
is recorded when a sale happens. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 the Company had sales of equity securities which yielded gross
realized gains of and gross realized losses of . For the same period, there were not any sales of debt securities for
gross realized gains, but sales of debt securities yielded gross realized losses of . Conversely, the Company recorded gross realized
gains on equity securities of and gross realized losses of for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. As for debt securities,
there were not any sales of debt securities for gross realized gains, but sales of debt securities yielded gross realized losses of 
for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2022. The gross realized loss numbers include the impaired figures listed in the previous paragraph.
Additionally, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale were for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and were 
for the prior fiscal year.

The
unrealized losses on the Company s investments in municipal bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms
of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Because
the Company has the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value occurs, which may be maturity, the Company does
not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at April 30, 2023 and 2022.

these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at April 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Upon leaving the Company, each participant is vested with respect to the participants

 on Accounting and Financial Disclosures 

There
were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. 

Item
9A Controls
 and Procedures 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures: 

Based
on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as
of April 30, 2023 our president and chief executive officer (also working as our chief financial officer) has concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective such that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer (also working
as our chief financial officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A control system cannot provide absolute
assurance, however, that the objectives of the control systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Internal
control over financial reporting : 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the
Company. Due to limited resources, Management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). The
results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective for the years ended of April
30, 2023 and 2022, due to a material weakness. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. 

Management s
assessment identified the following material weakness in internal control over financial reporting: 

The
 small size of our Company limits our ability to achieve the desired level of separation of
 duties for proper internal controls and financial reporting, particularly as it relates to
 financial reporting to assure material disclosures or implementation of newly issued accounting
 standards are included. A secondary review over annual and quarterly filings does occur with
 an outside party. A part-time Controller was hired in March 2023, but the current CEO and
 CFO roles are being fulfilled by the same individual. We do not have an audit committee.
 We do not believe we have met the full requirement for separation of duties for financial
 reporting purposes. 

Because
of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management has concluded that,
as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. 

We
will continue to follow the standards for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for internal control over financial
reporting to include procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail that fairly reflect the transactions and
 dispositions of the Company s assets; 
 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
 the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
 that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
 and the Board of Directors; and 
 
 Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
 use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the
 financial statements. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Corporation s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Corporation s independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, that permit the Corporation to provide
only the management s report in this annual report.

Business Experience of Directors and Executive Officers 

Stephanie
Risk-McElroy , Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, has over twenty-nine years of experience
in the accounting field. Mrs. Risk-McElroy graduated from Hastings College with a degree in Accounting. Stephanie worked for Platte Valley
Sales from May 1990 until January 1997 as a staff accountant. In 1997, she pursued her career with an accounting manager position at
Kershner s Auto Korner in Hastings, NE. She joined the accounting staff at GRI in 1999 and then was promoted to CFO upon retirement
of the prior CFO. Upon the death of her father, Ken R. Risk, in February 2013, she was appointed to the position of Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer. 

Mrs.
Risk-McElroy serves on the Board of Directors of GRI, as a direct link to the financial condition of the Company. She and her staff oversee
all the accounting obligations of the Company. She has knowledge and experience in business outside of the Company that makes her an
asset to the Board. And as President of the Company, she oversees all of the day-to-day operations as well. 

Sharon
Westby , the Corporate Secretary, worked at GRI right after high school for a couple of years as the personal secretary to the Founder
of the Company, George Risk, who was President and CEO. Before she returned to the Company in 1982, Sharon was a Clerk Steno 1 at Jackson
County Welfare in Kansas City, MO, worked in medical records at the Kimball County Hospital in Kimball, NE, and also managed motels in
Texas and Nebraska. She is the Executive Assistant to the President and CEO and Sales Administrator of the Keyboard and Switch division
of GRI. 

Mrs.
Westby continues in her position on the Board of Directors at GRI with over 37 years of experience with the Company. She has seen the
Company through many years of ups and downs, has broad knowledge of her product line and is very customer oriented in trying to sell
her products to the non-security use industry. 

Donna
Debowey , Director, worked in various retail stores and restaurants until she started at GRI in 1968. She started on the production
line, but quickly worked her way up the ranks. She has been a Production Line Supervisor, Director of Quality Control and was named Plant
Manager and Senior Vice President in 1998. She held that position until her retirement in 2003. 

Mrs.
Debowey made the transition from employee of GRI to a member of the Board of Directors with no hesitation after her retirement. She brings
her 50+ years of experience in the industry to the table and has a vested interest in seeing the continued success of the Company that
she helped to build. 

Joel
H. Wiens , Director, is an entrepreneur with many business interests. He is a director and principal shareholder of FirsTier Banks
Nebraska/Wyoming, director of FirsTier II BanCorporation (which owns FirsTier Bank Nebraska/Wyoming), Chairman of Rite-A-Way Industries
(lodging and hospitality industries), real estate investments, and ranching and livestock. 

Mr.
Wiens took his place on the Board of Directors when his predecessor Mike Nelson, (who is affiliated with Mr. Wiens financial institutions)
retired from the Board to take another position within the banks and moved away. Joel s knowledge and experience in business and
industry span 60+ years and serves as a valuable asset to GRI. 

Bonita
P. Risk, Director, attended Wayne State College, in Wayne, Nebraska. Upon returning back home to Columbus, NE, she worked in factory
positions. Upon her marriage to Ken Risk, she became a homemaker, raising 3 children and working at several sales positions. In 1981,
she and Ken started Platte Valley Sales in Hastings, Nebraska, and her expertise was in accounting and sales. For 8 years, she ran the
Hastings business while Ken devoted his time to both GRI in Kimball and Platte Valley Sales in Hastings. Ken and Bonita moved to Kimball
in 1997. In 1998, she began at GRI in sales support. She continues in sales support and became the Company stock transfer agent in 2004
upon the retirement of Eileen Risk and is an assistant to the chief financial officer. 

Jerry
Knutsen , Director, has lived in Kimball, Nebraska most of his life. He left the community for a few years to attend the University
of Nebraska at Lincoln. Before his retirement, Jerry owned and operated several businesses over his career, including Knutsen Oil, Inc.,
Marv s LP Gas, Inc., and Jerry Knutsen, Inc., and he co-owned Kimball Ford-Lincoln-Mercury. He served 24 years and held several
positions on the school board in Kimball, NE. Mr. Knutsen is a past member and president of The Nebraska Propane Gas Association and
The Nebraska Petroleum Marketers Convenience Store Association. Other boards he is presently serving on include the Kimball Schools
Foundation Board of Directors and Kimball Health Services Board of Trustees.

Compliance
with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10 of a registered class of our
equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports
concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors
and greater than 10 shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they
file. 

Based
solely on our review of copies of the Section 16(a) reports filed for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, we believe that all filing
requirements applicable to our officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners were complied with. 

Code
of Ethics and Code of Business Conduct 

The
Company does not have a written code of ethics at this time. The Company is a small business and employees know that the President of
the Company must approve all material business. The Company also has checks and balances to make sure that there is not any fraud or
illegal activities taking place. 

Corporate
Governance 

Nominating
and Compensation Committees 

We
do not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. Our Board of Directors believes
that it is not necessary to have a standing compensation committee at this time because our Board of Directors adequately performs the
functions of such committee. 

Our
Board of Directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for us not to have a standing nominating committee because our Board of
Directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating committee. Our Board of Directors has not adopted a
charter for the nomination committee. There have not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations
or nomination for directors. Our Board of Directors does not believe that a defined policy with regard to the consideration of candidates
recommended by stockholders is necessary at this time because we believe that, given the early stages of our development, a specific
nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations are at a more advanced level. 

Audit
Committee 

We
do not have a standing audit committee at the present time. Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member
that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a board
member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. 

Other
Committees 

All
proceedings of our Board of Directors for the year ended April 30, 2023 were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by our
directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors. Our Company currently does not have any committees.

The

known to be the beneficial owner of 5 or more of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each executive officer and director, and (iii) all

or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of such security.
A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which the person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership
within 60 days. Shares of Common Stock subject to options, warrants or convertible securities exercisable or convertible within 60 days
are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person or entity holding such options, warrants or convertible securities
but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person. Percentages are determined based on 4,930,543 shares
of Common Stock of the Company issued and outstanding and less treasury shares as of April 30, 2023. To the best of our knowledge, subject
to community and marital property laws, all persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as
