PART
I 

Item 1. Business. 

ADMIRAL FINANCIAL CORP. ADMIRAL ), an
inactive corporation, is currently seeking to recapitalize the Company in order to resume its prior activities with respect to the acquisition
and investment in interest-earning assets and specialty real estate, as well as other new lines of business, as yet unidentified. 

Admiral is presently conducting virtually no business
operation, other than its efforts to effect a merger, exchange of capital stock, asset acquisition, recapitalization, or other similar
business combination (a Recapitalization with an operating or development stage business which Admiral considers having significant
growth potential. Admiral currently receives no cash flow. Admiral anticipates no capital infusions prior to effectuating a Recapitalization.
Until such time as Admiral effectuates a Recapitalization, with the exception of certain other professional fees and costs for such a
transaction, Admiral currently expects that it will incur minimal future operating costs. 

No officer or director of Admiral is paid any type
of compensation by Admiral and presently, there are no arrangements or anticipated arrangements to pay any type of compensation to any
officer or director in the near future. Admiral expects that it will meet its cash requirements until such time as a Recapitalization
occurs. However, in the event Admiral depletes its present cash reserves, or in the event that Admiral Management ceases to perform its
duties on a non-compensatory basis, Admiral may cease operations and a Recapitalization may not occur. There are no agreements or understandings
of any kind with respect to any loans from officers or directors of Admiral on the Company's behalf. 

This discussion may contain statements regarding
future financial performance and results. The realization of outcomes consistent with these forward-looking statements is subject to numerous
risks and uncertainties to the Company including, but not limited to, the availability of equity capital and financing sources, the availability
of attractive acquisition opportunities once such new equity capital and financing is secured (if at all), the successful integration
and profitable management of acquired businesses, improvement of operating efficiencies, the availability of working capital and financing
for future acquisitions, the Company's ability to grow internally through expansion of services and customer bases without significant
increases in overhead, seasonality, cyclicality, and other risk factors.

Item 2. Properties. 

Admiral Financial Corp.'s principal office is located
in South Miami, Florida. The Company is currently being allowed to share, free of charge, certain office facilities and office equipment
located at 7101 Southwest 67 Avenue, South Miami, Florida 33143. Admiral does not have any lease obligations. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

On August 5, 1993, Admiral filed a Complaint
against the United States of America in the United States Court of Federal Claims, arising in part out of contractual promises made to
Admiral by the United States' Government, acting through the Federal Home Loan Bank Board FHLBB and the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation FSLIC pursuant to their statutory supervisory authority over federally insured savings and
loan institutions and savings banks (hereinafter referred to a thrifts or thrift institutions ), and in part out
of takings of property by the FHLBB and FSLIC in the course of exercising that authority. On October 16, 2002, the Court granted
the Admiral Motion for Summary Judgment in part, by finding that the United States Government liable for damages for breach of contract,
pending the taking of testimony regarding a possible prior material breach by Admiral. A trial was conducted during December 2002,
and testimony was taken regarding the value of the assets originally contributed by Admiral, and the Government's arguments regarding
Admiral's prior material breach were heard by the Court. On August 1, 2003, the Court held in favor of the United States Government,
stating that Admiral had committed a prior material breach when the Company did not meet the minimum capital requirement at March 31,
1989, despite the fact that FIRREA was enacted (on August 9, 1989) prior to the end of Admiral's cure period (October 16,
1989), thereby making such a cure impossible to perform. Admiral appealed, and the finding of the Court of Federal Claims was affirmed
in August 2004. Admiral did not pursue this litigation any further. 

Admiral is not a party to any other legal proceedings.

standards were not met. 

From September 30, 1989 until October 1999,

Admiral has a policy of paying discretionary bonuses
to eligible officers and employees based upon the individual's performance. Under the plan, Admiral and its subsidiaries distribute approximately
20 of Admiral's consolidated pre-tax profits in the form of cash bonuses awarded by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,

on Form 10K.

Retirement Plan 

No Admiral employee is currently covered under any
form of retirement plan. 

In prior years, Admiral employees were covered under
a non- contributory trusteed pension plan, which was replaced by a contributory Section 401(k) plan for Admiral employees on March 31,
1989. Employees were permitted to contribute amounts up to 6 of their annual salary to this plan, with the employer providing matching
contributions at a rate of 50 of such employee's contributions (to a maximum of 3 of such employee's salary), together with a discretionary
contribution amount not exceeding 1 of covered compensation. No payments have been required to be paid during the periods covered by

The Board of Directors and shareholders of Admiral
adopted the 1988 Stock Compensation Program (the Program ), effective December 19, 1988, for the benefit of directors,
officers and other employees of Admiral and its subsidiaries, including Haven, who are deemed to be responsible for the future growth
of Admiral. Under the Program, Admiral has reserved 1,100,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock for the future issuance of
option grants. Options granted under the Program can be in the form of incentive options, compensatory options, stock appreciation rights,
performance shares, or any combination thereof.

to any director, officer or employee of Admiral or any affiliate. The Company expects to distribute such option grants in the event of
any Recapitalization transaction. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Board of Directors and shareholders of Admiral
approved the 1988 Employee Stock Purchase Program on December 19, 1988, enabling the directors, officers and employees of Admiral
and its affiliates to acquire a proprietary interest in Admiral's Common Stock through a payroll deduction program. This plan has been
suspended by Admiral management. 

Employment Agreements 

There are no employment agreements between Admiral
and any of Admiral's employees. 

Indebtedness of Management 

Admiral has made no loans to its directors, officers
or employees. 

Compensation of Directors 

While each Director is entitled to receive 500 plus
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for attending each meeting, each Director volunteered to suspend the receipt of all director fees due
to Admiral's current financial condition, beginning with the meeting held during the third fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30,
