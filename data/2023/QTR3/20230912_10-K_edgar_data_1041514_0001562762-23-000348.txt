 ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS 

 Overview 

 At Lesaka, our 
core purpose is 
to improve people s lives by 
bringing financial inclusion to 
South Africa s underserved consumers 
 and merchants. 

 We 
achieve 
this through 
our ability 
to efficiently 
digitize the 
last mile 
of financial 
inclusion, 
providing 
a full-service 
fintech 
 platform serving both cash and digital, and facilitating the secular shift from 
cash to digital that is currently taking place. 

 Lesaka uses its proprietary banking and payment technologies 
to distribute low-cost financial and value-added 
services to small 
 businesses, primarily 
in the 
informal sector, 
and to 
consumers, the 
majority of 
whom are 
grant beneficiaries, 
both largely 
excluded 
 from financial services. 
 Our vision 
is to 
build and 
operate the 
leading full-service 
fintech platform 
in Southern 
Africa, offering 
cash management 
and 
 digitization, card acquiring and payment processing, Value 
Added Services VAS ), 
and growth capital to micro, small and medium 
 enterprises MSME 
merchants 
and 
financial 
services 
to 
underserved 
consumers. 
Our 
dual-sided 
financial 
ecosystem 
has 
two 
 overlapping divisions: Merchants and Consumers. 

3 
 Customers
 
In 
our 
B2C 
Consumer 
Division 
we 
focus 
specifically 
on 
South 
Africa s 
social 
grant 
beneficiaries, 
who 
have 
 historically been 
excluded from 
traditional financial 
services. Our 
products are 
designed for 
consumers at 
the lower 
socioeconomic 
 end of the 
market within Living 
Standards Measures LSMs 1 
to 6, which 
comprises approximately 26 million 
people. We currently 
 have approximately 1.3 million active consumers. 
 In our B2B Merchant Division we 
focus on MSME operating in 
the informal and formal sectors of 
the South African economy. 
 The informal 
sector merchants are 
generally smaller 
and operate 
in rural 
areas or in 
informal urban 
areas and do 
not have 
access to 
 traditional banking 
products. The 
formal merchants 
are generally 
in urban 
areas, have 
larger turnovers 
and have 
access to 
multiple 
 service providers. We operate separate brands in these two sectors of the economy. The informal market consists of approximately 1.4 
 million 
merchants 
and 
the 
formal 
market 
approximately 
700,000 
merchants. 
Our 
Merchant 
Division 
currently 
has 
over 
82,000 
 customers using our solutions. 
 Products
 We offer 
a comprehensive set of products and services to our consumer and merchant 
customers. 
 In our Consumer Division, our products include transactional banking, short-term loans, a digital wallet as well as insurance and 
 various VAS to underserved consumers in South 
Africa, aligning with 
our purpose of 
improving people s lives and increasing 
financial 
 inclusion. Our value proposition and products are designed to be simple, 
relevant and cost effective for our target market. 

 In our 
Merchant Division, 
to informal 
and formal 
MSME customers, 
we offer 
cash management 
and digitization 
through our 
 proprietary vault technology, card acquiring, innovative growth capital, bill and supplier payment solutions, and a wide range of VAS 
 products for 
our merchants 
to sell. 
To 
the larger 
enterprise level 
merchants, we 
offer bill 
and supplier 
payments and 
VAS 
products 
 through our proprietary financial switch, as well as Ingenico point of sale device and maintenance, bank and SIM card production and 
 other specialized technology products. 

4 
 Market Opportunity 
 There 
are 
real 
challenges 
to 
delivering 
financial 
inclusion 
and 
digitization 
in 
the 
South 
African 
market. 
One 
of 
these 
major 
 challenges is 
the deep 
distrust and 
a lack 
of understanding 
of cash 
alternatives, which 
is driven 
by low 
levels of 
financial literacy. 
 Adding to this 
challenge are the 
relatively high connectivity 
costs and the 
low smartphone penetration 
in South Africa, 
where many 
 South 
Africans 
still use 
older style 
feature phones. 
Together, 
this means 
that although 
almost 90 
of South 
Africans have 
a bank 
 account, a significant majority treat them as post boxes and withdraw all their money in one 
transaction. This has real implications for 
 both merchants and consumers. 

 For merchants 
this means less 
than 8 have 
access to formal 
credit and 
less than 4 
of informal 
merchants are able 
to accept 
 digital payments. For consumers, only 
an estimated 20 of the approximately 
26 million South African consumers in 
LSM 1-6 have 
 access to 
credit and 
savings, 
and a 
significant majority 
of the 
12 million 
permanent social 
grant recipients 
require immediate 
cash 
 withdrawals of their grant. 
 These sources 
of friction 
and challenges present 
a significant market 
opportunity for 
Lesaka to provide 
innovative solutions 
to 
 both merchants 
and consumers, 
and more 
importantly, 
to facilitate 
wider financial 
inclusion and 
digitization. Lesaka 
has for 
a long 
 time been at the forefront of providing financial inclusion and digitization 
for consumers and merchants in this space. 
 Consumer financial 
services for 
the unbanked:
 
Our focus 
is on 
the LSM 
1 to 
6 population 
in South 
Africa, which 
represents 
 approximately 
26 
million 
adults 
in 
the 
country. 
Within 
that, 
we 
estimate 
there 
to 
be 
approximately 
12 
million 
people 
reliant 
on 
 permanent grants. 
South Africa is 
primarily a 
cash-based economy, 
with approximately 
60 of transactions 
still conducted 
in cash. 
 In the Consumer Division, we currently have 1.3 million active account holders which represents approximately 4 share of our total 
 addressable market. 
Our focus is 
on South 
African government 
social grant 
recipients the 
majority of 
whom are 
being inadequately 
 served by the current system. Lesaka is well 
placed to address the needs of these consumers with 
its large informal market distribution 
 and affordable financial services. 
 Merchant payment 
solutions and financial 
services for MSMEs: 
 There are 
approximately 2.1 
million MSMEs in 
South Africa, 
 of which 
around 1.4 
million operate 
in the 
informal market, 
and it 
is estimated 
that only 
4 of 
these can 
accept digital 
payments. 
 Lesaka 
has 
a 
comprehensive 
product 
suite 
of 
cash 
and 
digital 
solutions 
which 
provide 
a 
significant 
opportunity 
to 
assist 
these 
 businesses to grow, 
reduce cash related operating 
risks and become more 
efficient. This is an 
underserved market and increasing 
our 
 penetration is 
more about 
providing solutions 
that encourage 
the adoption 
of more 
formalized and 
non-cash transacting 
than about 
 taking market share from competitors. 
 While the informal market presents a major growth opportunity, 
Lesaka also has a comprehensive offering to the formal MSME 
 and enterprise market. 

5 
 Competition 
 With 
our comprehensive 
offering 
to consumers 
and merchants 
we compete 
with a 
wide range 
of service 
providers. There 
are 
 competitors for 
individual products and 
services, although 
few with an 
end-to-end offering, 
particularly at 
the lower 
socioeconomic 
 end of the consumer market and the informal merchant market, where we 
have a significant footprint and penetration. 

 In our 
Consumer Division, 
there are 
a number 
of traditional 
and digital 
providers of 
low-cost transactional 
bank accounts 
and 
 micro financial services. These include South African banks such as 
FNB, Standard Bank, Absa, Nedbank, African Bank and Capitec, 
 the South African 
Post Bank, and digital 
banks such as, Tyme 
Bank and Bank 
Zero. In the South 
African ATM 
network market, we 
 compete against the South African banks, ATM 
Solutions and Spark ATM 
Systems, which collectively have a market share in excess 
 of 90 . 
 In the informal merchant sector, there 
are no competitors which offer a comprehensive product 
set of cash, card, payment, VAS 
 and capital 
solutions, such 
as ours. 
In the 
formal merchant 
sector there 
is significantly 
more competition, 
with banks 
and non-bank 
 fintech companies targeting these merchants. 

 In card acquiring, competitors include 
Yoco, 
iKhokha, Sureswipe and the South African 
banks; in VAS 
and bill payments, they 
 include Flash, Blue Label, Shop2Shop, Pay@ and Ukeshe; in lending, they 
include Lulalend, Merchant Capital, Retail Capital and the 
 South African banks; and in cash management, they include Fidelity, 
G4S, Cashnet and the South African banks. 
 At an enterprise level, our financial switch and VAS and bill payments business competes with BankservAfrica, Pay@, eCentric 
 and Transaction Junction. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 Over 
the 
last 
two 
years 
we 
have 
built 
a 
diverse 
team 
of 
high-caliber 
individuals, 
from 
different 
organizations, 
to 
form 
our 
 leadership group. This 
leadership group is 
deeply committed to 
building a high-performance 
culture that is 
based on our core 
values 
 and a commitment to the care and development of our people. 
 Lesaka s Core Values: 
 
 Entrepreneurial spirit; 
 
 Integrity; 
 
 Collective wisdom; and 
 
 A bias to action. 
 These are our 
values that underpin 
our mission 
to enable 
Merchants to compete 
and grow, 
and Grant 
Beneficiaries to improve 
 their lives, by providing innovative financial technology and value 
-creating solutions. 
 Employee training and skills development 
 We strongly believe that learning 
is an ongoing process and that the majority of learning is in the doing. As such, while we offer 
 a range of formal 
programs (as listed further 
below), more importantly, 
we continue to encourage 
a culture of learning 
in everything 
 that we do. 
 Sustainable 
employee 
training and 
development 
programs impact 
employee 
retention, 
and 
we believe 
that our 
willingness to 
 invest 
in 
employee 
development 
contributes 
to 
employee 
satisfaction 
and 
belonging. 
This 
increases 
loyalty, 
which 
will 
in 
turn 
 contribute 
to employee retention. We 
offer the following development programs to enhance employee 
performance and skills: 
 
 unemployed and employed learnerships; 
 
 internships; 
 
 leadership development programs; 
 
 training programs; 
 
 other in-house and cross-functional training to aid with career advancement; 
and 
 
 succession planning training interventions. 
 Equal opportunity 
 Having an inclusive 
and diverse workforce 
which reflects our 
economically active population 
and society in 
general, is crucial 
 for helping the organization attract and retain talent and is important for long-term organizational success. Our 
human resources team 
 emphasizes recruiting 
and retaining 
a talented 
and diverse 
workforce with 
special focus 
on hiring 
previously disadvantaged 
groups 
 whenever possible. We 
are committed to hiring qualified candidates without regard 
to their personal status, while taking into account 
 the 
unique 
circumstances 
affecting 
our 
operations 
in 
South 
Africa 
and 
the 
need 
to 
uplift 
previously 
disadvantaged 
groups. 
This 
 commitment extends to all levels of our organization, 
including within senior management and our board of directors. 

6 
 As of June 30, 2023, the composition of our workforce was: 
 
 55 female and 45 male; 
 
 35 between 18 and 34 years old, 60 between 35 and 54 years old, and 5 over 
55 years old; and 
 
 67 Black, 11 two or more races, 7 Indian and 15 
White. 
 We have no 
female named executive officers. 
 We 
continue 
to strive 
to build 
a more 
inclusive workforce 
and to 
enhance our 
pay structures 
by taking 
measures to 
eliminate 
 potential remuneration discrimination 
and to help close gender pay gaps 
to progress towards gender equality 
at work. We 
have taken 
 positive strides towards a rewards philosophy that rewards 
high performance, 
is externally benchmarked and focuses on equal people 
 for equal work. 
 Employee compensation programs 
 We 
are committed 
to 
ensuring 
that 
all 
our 
employees 
are 
paid 
fair 
and 
competitive 
remuneration. To 
that 
end, 
we 
offer the 
 following to our employees: 

Access to a comprehensive medical, dental, and vision plan that our employees 
have the option to join; 
 
 Access to a defined contribution retirement plan that our employees have 
the option to join; 
 
 Paid sick, study, annual 
and family responsibility leave; 
 
 Maternity benefits; 
 
 Life and disability insurance coverage; 
 
 Employee assistance programs; and 
 
 Product discounts. 

 Annual 
increases 
and 
incentive 
compensation 
are 
based 
on 
merit, 
which 
is 
communicated 
to 
employees 
at 
onboarding 
and 
 documented as part of our annual performance review process. 
 Our number 
of employees

 Corporate history 
 Lesaka was incorporated 
in Florida in 
May 1997 as 
Net 1 
UEPS Technologies, Inc. and 
changed its name 
to Lesaka Technologies, 
 Inc. on May 12, 2022. In 2004, Lesaka acquired Net1 Applied Technology 
Holdings Limited Aplitec ), a public company listed on 
 the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange JSE ). In 
2005, Lesaka 
completed an 
initial public 
offering 
and listed 
on the 
NASDAQ Stock 
 Market. In 
2008, Lesaka 
listed on 
the JSE 
in a 
secondary listing, 
which enabled 
the former 
Aplitec shareholders 
(as well 
as South 
 African residents generally) to hold Lesaka common stock directly.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

 OUR OPERATIONS 
AND FINANCIAL 
RESULTS 
ARE SUBJECT 
TO VARIOUS 
RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES, 
 INCLUDING 
THOSE 
DESCRIBED 
BELOW, 
THAT 
COULD 
ADVERSELY 
AFFECT 
OUR 
BUSINESS, 
FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION, RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS, 
CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 To achieve our mission, our 
strategy is to 
build and operate 
the leading South 
African full service 
fintech 
 platform offering cash management, payment 
and financial services. 
Our future success, and our ability 
to 
 return 
to 
profitability 
and 
positive 
cash 
flow 
is 
substantially 
dependent 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
complete 
the 
 implementation of this strategy successfully. 
 Our board conducted an extensive 
review of our business strategy 
and operations in July 2020, 
and decided to focus on 
our South 
 African 
operations 
and 
other 
business 
opportunities 
in 
South 
Africa 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
African 
continent. 
The 
 restructuring 
of 
the 
consumer 
business 
and 
acquisition 
of 
Connect 
were 
integral 
parts 
of 
the 
strategy 
to 
return 
the 
business 
to 
 profitability and positive cash flow. We have made significant progress on both of these initiatives however we cannot assure you that 
 we will be able to complete our strategy successfully and return to profitability and 
positive cash flow. 
 Even if we do return to profitability, achieving net income does not necessarily 
ensure positive cash flows. Future periods of net 
 losses 
from 
operations 
could 
result 
in 
negative 
cash 
flow 
and 
may 
hamper 
ongoing 
operations 
or 
prevent 
us 
from 
sustaining 
or 
 expanding our business. We cannot assure you that we will achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the future and if we do not, our 
 business will be materially and adversely affected. 
 In 2017 
and 2018 we 
suffered significant 
reputational damage 
as a result 
of irregularities in 
the awarding of 
the South African 
 Social Security Agency SASSA 
grant distribution contract in 
2012 and allegations of abuse 
of group companies access to social 
 grant recipients. 
An entirely new 
board and management 
team were appointed 
to develop and 
execute the new 
strategy however we 
 cannot provide assurance that issues related to those events will not resurface 
and adversely affect the business. 
 We 
have a 
significant amount 
of indebtedness that 
requires us 
to comply with 
restrictive and financial 
 covenants. If we are unable to comply with these 
covenants, we could default on this debt, which would have 
 a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 As 
of 
June 
30, 
2023, 
we 
had 
aggregate 
long-term 
borrowing 
outstanding 
of 
ZAR 
2.5 
billion 133.1 
million 
translated 
at 
 exchange rates 
as of June 
30, 2023). We 
financed our acquisition 
of Connect 
in April 2022 
through South 
African bank borrowings 
 of ZAR 1.1 billion 71.7 million, translated at 
closing date exchange 
rate (as defined in the 
Sale Agreement) of 1:ZAR 
14.65165). 
 The borrowings 
are secured 
by a 
pledge of 
certain of 
our bank 
accounts, and 
the cession 
of Lesaka s 
shareholding 
in certain 
of its 
 subsidiaries. These borrowings contain customary covenants that require Lesaka Technologies 
(Pty) Ltd Lesaka SA to maintain a 
 specified total asset 
cover ratio and restrict 
the ability of 
Lesaka, Lesaka SA, 
and certain of its 
subsidiaries to make 
certain distributions 
 with respect 
to their 
capital stock, 
prepay other 
debt, encumber 
their assets, 
incur additional 
indebtedness, 
make investment 
above 
 specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in 
other corporate activities. 
 The loan agreements also include a credit enhancement mechanism of ZAR 
350 million 23.9 million, translated at closing date 
 exchange rate), which has been provided by investment 
funds managed by Lesaka s 
largest shareholder, Value 
Capital Partners (Pty) 
 Ltd VCP 
which includes 
a contingent 
subscription for 
new shares. 
There can 
be no 
assurance that 
VCP will 
perform under 
the 
 commercially agreed 
terms and failure 
by it to 
fulfil its obligation 
under the credit 
enhancement mechanism 
may put our 
funding or 
 future repayments at risk. 
 We also 
have borrowings through 
Connect. Connect s 
credit facilities include (i) 
an overdraft facility (general 
banking facility) 
 of ZAR 205.0 
million (of which 
ZAR 170.0 million 
has been utilized); 
(ii) Facility A 
of ZAR 700.0 
million; (iii) Facility 
B of ZAR 
 550.0 
million 
(both fully 
utilized); 
and 
(iv) 
an asset-backed 
facility of 
ZAR 
200.0 
million 
(of which 
ZAR 
149.1 
million 
has been 
 utilized). 
These borrowings are 
secured by a 
pledge of, 
among other things, 
Cash Connect Management 
Solutions CCMS entire 
 equity interests 
in its 
subsidiaries and 
investments and 
any claims 
outstanding. These 
borrowings contain 
customary covenants 
that 
 require CCMS to maintain specified debt service, interest cover and leverage ratios. 
 Within our merchant lending 
operations, we have 
borrowing arrangements through 
Cash Connect Capital 
(Pty) Limited CCC ). 
 CCC has a 
ZAR 300 
million revolving 
credit facility agreement. 
We 
have utilized 
approximately ZAR 
222.3 million 
as of June 
30, 
 2023. 
This 
facility 
contains 
customary 
covenants 
that 
require 
the 
borrowing 
parties 
to 
collectively 
maintain 
a 
specified 
capital 
 adequacy ratio, restrict the ability of the entities to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, 
encumber their assets, 
 incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in certain 
business combinations and engage in other corporate activities. 

10 
 These security arrangements and covenants may 
reduce our operating flexibility or 
our ability to engage in 
other transactions that 
 may 
be 
beneficial 
to 
us. 
If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
covenants, 
we 
could 
be 
in 
default 
and 
the 
indebtedness 
could 
be 
 accelerated. If this were to occur, we might not be able to obtain waivers of default or to refinance the debt with another lender and as 
 a result, our business, financial condition and stock price would suffer. 
 We 
need to 
significantly grow 
our consumer 
operations in 
order to 
ensure their 
profitability and 
long-
 term sustainability. 

 Following the conclusion of our contract with SASSA, we 
refocused our resources and technology on the 
provision of financial 
 inclusion 
services 
to 
our 
target 
market 
and 
currently 
have 
an 
established 
base 
of 
approximately 
1.3 
million 
customers 
of 
which 
 approximately 
1.1 million 
are permanent 
grant recipients. 
Our strategy 
involves significantly 
expanding this 
base over 
the coming 
 years. While we believe that our financial services offerings are convenient and cost-effective, the success of our strategy will depend 
 on the extent to which we successfully market our offering to 
grow the customer base. 
 Factors that may prevent us from successfully operating and expanding our 
Consumer Division include, but are not limited to: 

insufficient adoption and utilization of our products and 
services; 
 
 inability to access sufficient funding for our ATM 
infrastructure; 
 
 increased 
competition 
in 
the 
marketplace 
and 
restrictions 
imposed 
by 
SASSA 
or 
the 
South 
African 
government 
on 
the 
 manner in which grant recipients may transact; 
 
 political interference and changes in the regulatory environment; 
 
 failure to comply with laws and regulations related to our Consumer lending 
business; 
 
 failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws and 
regulations; 
 
 cyber-attacks, data breaches and data leaks; 
 
 further civil unrest similar to that experienced in July 2021; 
 
 loss of key technical and operations staff; 
 
 expired property leases disrupting business operations; and 
 
 logistical and communications challenges, including scheduled and unscheduled 
power supply disruptions. 
 We may undertake acquisitions 
that could 
increase our 
costs or 
liabilities or 
be disruptive 
to our 
business. 
 Acquisitions are 
an integral part 
of our new 
growth strategy 
as we seek 
to expand our 
business and deploy 
our technologies 
in 
 new markets 
in Southern 
Africa. However, 
we may 
not be 
able to 
locate suitable 
acquisition 
candidates at 
prices that 
we consider 
 appropriate. 
If 
we 
do 
identify an 
appropriate 
acquisition 
candidate, 
we 
may 
not be 
able to 
successfully 
negotiate 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
 transaction, finance it 
or, if the 
transaction occurs, integrate the 
new business into 
our existing business. 
These transactions may 
require 
 debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in additional leverage 
or dilution of ownership. 
 Acquisitions of businesses 
or other material 
operations and the 
integration of these 
acquisitions or their 
businesses will require 
 significant attention 
from members 
of our senior 
management team, 
which may 
divert their 
attention from 
our day-to-day 
business. 
 The difficulties 
of integration 
may be 
increased by 
the necessity 
of integrating 
personnel with 
disparate business 
backgrounds 
and 
 combining 
different 
corporate cultures. 
We 
also may 
not be 
able to 
retain key 
employees or 
customers 
of an 
acquired business 
or 
 realize 
cost 
efficiencies 
or 
synergies 
or 
other 
benefits 
that 
we 
anticipated 
when 
selecting 
our 
acquisition 
candidates. 
Acquisition 
 candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to 
discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. 
 We 
may 
need 
to record 
write-downs 
from future 
impairments of 
goodwill or 
other intangible 
assets, which 
could reduce 
our 
 future reported earnings. 
 Geopolitical 
conflicts, 
including 
the 
conflict 
between 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine, 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 business and results of operations. 
 The 
current 
conflict 
between 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine 
is 
creating 
substantial 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
future 
of 
the 
global 
economy. 
 Countries across the globe are instituting sanctions and other 
penalties against Russia. The retaliatory measures that 
have been taken, 
 and could 
be taken 
in the 
future, by 
the U.S., 
NATO, 
and other 
countries have 
created global 
security concerns 
that could 
result in 
 broader European military and political conflicts and otherwise have a substantial impact on regional and 
global economies, any or all 
 of which could adversely affect our business. 

11 
 While the broader consequences are 
uncertain at this time, 
the continuation and/or escalation of 
the Russian and Ukraine 
conflict, 
 along 
with 
any 
expansion 
of the 
conflict 
to 
surrounding 
areas, create 
a 
number 
of risks 
that 
could 
adversely 
impact 
our 
business, 
 including: 
 
 increased inflation and significant volatility in the macroeconomic 
environment; 
 
 disruptions to our technology infrastructure, including through cyberattacks, 
ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion; 
 
 adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; 
 
 disruptions in global supply chains; and 
 
 constraints, volatility or disruption in the credit and capital markets. 
 All of these risks could 
materially and adversely affect 
our business and results of operations. 
We are 
continuing to monitor the 
 situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing the potential impact on our business.
 A prolonged economic 
slowdown or lengthy 
or severe recession 
in South Africa 
or elsewhere could 
harm 
 our operations. 
 A prolonged economic 
downturn or recession 
in South Africa 
could materially 
impact our results 
from operations, particularly 
 in light of 
on-going electricity disruptions 
during calendar 2022 
and 2023, a 
significantly weak USD/ 
ZAR exchange rate 
compared 
 with previous periods, and our strategic decision to focus on our South African operations. Economic confidence in South Africa, our 
 main operating 
environment, is 
currently low 
and, as 
a result, the 
risk of 
a prolonged 
economic downturn 
is increased, which 
could 
 have a negative impact on merchants and retailers; mobile phone operators; our account holders; the 
level of transactions we process; 
 the take-up of 
the financial services 
we offer and 
the ability of our 
customers to repay 
our loans or to 
pay their insurance 
premiums. 
 If 
financial 
institutions 
and 
retailers experience 
decreased 
demand 
for 
their products 
and services, 
our 
hardware, 
software, 
related 
 technology sales and processing revenue could decrease. 
 Our investment in MobiKwik 
subjects us to certain 
risks, including the possibility 
of fluctuations in the 
 carrying value based on readily determinable fair values. In addition, our ability to dispose of our interest in 
 MobiKwik on acceptable terms, or at all, may be limited under certain circumstances. 

 We 
have elected to 
account for our 
investment in MobiKwik 
at cost minus impairment, 
if any, 
plus or minus changes 
resulting 
 from observable 
price changes 
in orderly 
transactions for 
the identical 
or similar 
instrument of 
the same 
issuer because 
it does 
not 
 have a readily determinable fair value. The determination of the fair value of an investment requires us to make significant judgments 
 and estimates and we are required to 
base our estimates on assumptions which 
we believe to be reasonable, but 
these assumptions may 
 be unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The value of our investment in MobiKwik as of 
June 30, 2023 and 2022, was 76.3 million 
 and was determined 
based on a 
share issuance concluded 
by MobiKwik in 
June 2021, implying 
a fair 
value per equity 
share of 12.275. 
 We 
did not identify 
any observable price 
changes during either 
of fiscal 2023 
and 2022 and therefore 
did not adjust 
the value of 
our 
 investment during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. We recorded 
a non-cash fair value adjustment of 49.3 million during the 
 year ended June 30, 2021, which increased the fair value to 76.3 
million. 
 MobiKwik filed its draft 
red herring prospectus in July 
2021, with the original intention 
of completing its initial public 
offering 
 in November 2021. However, MobiKwik decided to delay its initial public offering given 
prevailing market conditions at the time and 
 has indicated its intention to pursue an initial public listing in calendar 2024. 
 We 
may 
need to 
record a 
write-down of 
the carrying 
value of 
our investment 
in MobiKwik 
in the 
future (i) 
if it 
is unable 
to 
 successfully complete its contemplated initial public offering, (ii) due to fluctuations in its market price upon listing, including during 
 the lock up 
period after its 
initial public 
offering, or 
(iii) if it 
has not listed, 
there is an 
observable transaction 
indicating a 
fair value 
 per share 
which is 
lower than 
our 
June 30, 
2023 price 
per share. 
Furthermore, 
it may 
be difficult 
to dispose 
of some 
or all 
of our 
 investment on acceptable terms, if at all, if MobiKwik fails to list. 
 Our 
ability 
to 
fund 
our 
ATM 
network 
requires 
that 
we 
continue 
to 
have 
access 
to 
sufficient 
lending 
 facilities, which requires compliance with restrictive and financial covenants. 
 The operational 
maintenance 
of our 
ATM 
network, 
along with 
an increase 
in our 
consumer 
banking 
client base, 
necessitates 
 access to large 
amounts of cash 
to stock the 
ATMs 
and maintain uninterrupted 
service levels. We 
have credit facilities 
from a South 
 African 
bank 
which 
includes 
security 
arrangements 
as 
well 
as 
restrictive 
and 
financial 
covenants. 
The 
security 
arrangements 
and 
 covenants included in our lending facilities may reduce our operating flexibility or our ability to engage in other transactions that may 
 be beneficial to us. If we are unable to comply 
with the covenants in South Africa, we could be in default 
and the indebtedness could 
 be accelerated. If this were to occur, we might not be able to obtain waivers of default or to refinance the debt with another lender and 
 as a result, our business and financial condition would suffer. 

12 
 We may not be able to extend the terms 
of these debt facilities or 
refinance them, in each case, on 
commercially reasonable terms 
 or at all. Our 
ability to continue the 
uninterrupted operation of 
our ATM 
network will be adversely 
impacted by our failure 
to renew 
 our debt facilities, any adverse change to the terms 
of our credit facilities, or a 
significant reduction in the amounts available under our 
 credit facilities, 
or our 
failure to 
increase our 
facilities if 
required. We 
may also 
suffer reputational 
damage if 
our service 
levels are 
 negatively impacted due to the unavailability of cash. 
 We 
have 
purchased 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
prepaid 
airtime 
voucher 
inventory 
which 
exposes 
us 
to 
 market risk for this inventory as well as losses if the mobile network operators are unable to perform. 
 Historically, 
we 
have 
purchased 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
prepaid 
airtime 
inventory 
vouchers 
in 
order 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
 discounted 
pricing for 
this inventory. 
As of 
June 30, 
2023, the 
carrying 
value of 
this inventory 
is 4.0 
million (ZAR 
74.7 
million 
 translated at exchange rates applicable as of 
June 30, 2023). We expect to sell this inventory 
over the next three months which 
exposes 
 us to market risk for this inventory. The underlying service related to these 
airtime vouchers is provided by South Africa s four largest 
 mobile network 
operators operating 
in South 
Africa and 
therefore we 
are also 
exposed to 
performance 
risk by 
these operators. 
We 
 would be unable 
to sell these prepaid 
airtime vouchers if 
the mobile network 
operators were unable 
to provide their 
services and we 
 would need to 
write this inventory 
off. Failure 
to recover the 
carrying value of 
this inventory 
may have a 
material adverse effect 
on 
 our results of operations or financial condition. 
 We may be unable to recover the carrying value of certain Cell C 
airtime that we own. 
 We 
own a 
substantial amount 
of Cell 
C airtime 
inventory 8.6 
million translated 
at exchange 
rates applicable 
as of 
June 30, 
 2023). In support of 
Cell C s liquidity 
position and pursuant to Cell 
C s recapitalization 
process, we limited the resale 
of this airtime 
 through 
our 
distribution 
channels. 
On 
September 
30, 
2022, 
Cell 
C 
concluded 
its 
recapitalization 
process 
and 
we 
entered 
into 
an 
 agreement with Cell C under which 
Cell C agreed to repurchase, from 
October 2023, up to ZAR 10 million 
of Cell C inventory from 
 us per month. The amount to be 
repurchased by Cell C will be calculated 
as ZAR 10 million less the face 
value of any sales made by 
 the Company during that month. The Company continued to sell a minimum amount of Cell C airtime through its internal channels in 
 late 
fiscal 
2022/ 
early 
fiscal 2023 
in support 
of 
Cell C s 
liquidity 
position. 
However, 
our 
ability 
to 
sell this 
airtime 
has 
improved 
 significantly since 
the acquisition 
of Connect because 
Connect is a 
significant reseller 
of Cell C 
airtime. As 
a result, we 
sold higher 
 volumes of airtime through this channel than we did prior to the 
Cell C recapitalization, however, continued 
sales at these volumes is 
 dependent on 
prevailing conditions continuing 
in the airtime 
market. If 
we are able 
to sell at 
least ZAR 10 
million a month 
through 
 this channel 
from October 1, 
2023, then 
Cell C would 
not be required 
to repurchase any 
airtime from us 
during any specific 
month. 
 We 
have agreed 
to notify 
Cell C 
prior to 
selling any 
of this 
airtime, however, 
there is 
no restriction 
placed on 
us on 
the sale 
of the 
 airtime. 
 Historical and current limitations 
on our ability to freely dispose 
of this Cell C airtime time 
inventory exposes us to market 
risk 
 for this inventory. Due to wholesale discounts in the distribution market for this airtime, it is not readily saleable in the current market 
 without realising a loss. In light of this, we recorded 
a loss of 1.3 million during fiscal 2020, related 
to this airtime inventory. 
While 
 no further 
losses were 
recorded 
in fiscal 
2023, 
2022 and 
2021, we 
may be 
required to 
record further 
losses in 
the future 
if we 
are 
 unable to recover the carrying 
value of this airtime inventory 
or if Cell C is unable 
to repurchase the inventory 
as per our agreement. 
 Failure to 
recover the 
carrying value 
of this 
inventory may 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on our 
results of 
operations or 
financial 
 condition. 
 Our 
consumer 
microlending 
loan 
book 
and 
merchant 
lending 
book 
expose 
us 
to 
credit 
risk 
and 
our 
 allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs. 

 All of our microfinance loans made are for a period of six months or less and all of our merchant lending through Connect is for 
 a period 
of less 
than 12 
months. We 
have created 
an allowance 
for doubtful 
finance loans 
receivable related 
to these 
books. When 
 creating the allowance, 
management considered 
factors including the 
period of the 
finance loan outstanding, 
creditworthiness of 
the 
 customers and the past payment history of the borrower. We consider this policy to be appropriate as it takes into account factors such 
 as historical bad debts, current 
economic trends and changes in our 
customer payment patterns. However, 
additional allowances may 
 be required should the ability 
of our customers to 
make payments when due 
deteriorate in the future. 
A significant amount of judgment 
 is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these microfinance 
loan receivables. 
 We may face competition from other 
companies that offer innovative 
payment technologies and payment 
 processing, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
the 
loss 
of 
our 
existing 
business 
and 
adversely 
impact 
our 
ability 
to 
 successfully market additional products and services. 

 Our primary competitors in 
the payment processing 
market include other independent 
processors, as well 
as financial institutions, 
 independent 
sales 
organizations, 
new 
digital 
and 
fintech 
entrants 
and, 
potentially 
card 
networks. 
Many 
of 
our 
competitors 
are 
 companies who 
are larger 
than we 
are and 
have greater 
financial and 
operational resources 
than we 
have. These 
factors may 
allow 
 them to offer better pricing 
terms or incentives to customers, which 
could result in a loss of our potential 
or current customers and/or 
 force us to lower our prices. Either of these actions could have a significant effect 
on our revenues and earnings. 

13 
 Our 
future 
success 
will 
depend 
in 
part 
on 
our 
ability 
to 
attract, 
integrate, 
retain 
and 
incentivize 
key 
 personnel 
and 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
skilled 
employees, 
particularly 
in 
the 
technical, 
sales 
and 
senior 
 management areas. 
 We believe our management team has the right experience 
and skills to execute on our strategy. However, 
in order to succeed in 
 our product 
development and 
marketing efforts, 
we may 
need to identify 
and attract new 
qualified technical 
and sales personne 
l, as 
 well as motivate and retain our 
existing employees. As a result, an 
inability to hire and retain such 
employees would adversely affect 
 our ability to 
achieve our strategic 
goals and maintain 
our technological relevance. 
We may face difficulty in 
assimilating, transitioning 
 and integrating 
newly-hired 
personnel or 
management of 
any future 
acquisitions into 
our existing 
management team, 
and this 
may 
 adversely affect 
our business. Competitors 
may attempt 
to recruit 
our top 
management and 
employees. In 
order to attract 
and retain 
 personnel in 
a competitive 
marketplace, we 
must provide 
competitive pay 
packages, including 
cash and equity 
-based compensation 
 and 
the 
volatility 
in 
our 
stock 
price 
may 
from 
time 
to 
time 
adversely 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
recruit 
or retain 
employees. 
We 
do 
not 
 maintain 
any 
 key 
person 
life 
insurance 
policies. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
attract, 
integrate, 
retain 
and 
incentivize 
key 
personnel 
and 
skilled 
 employees, our ability to manage and grow our 
business could be harmed and our product 
development and marketing activities could 
 be negatively affected. 

 System failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business. 
 We 
may experience 
system failures 
from time 
to time, 
and any 
lengthy interruption 
in the availability 
of our 
back-end system 
 computers could harm our business and severely affect our customer relationships. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services 
 could cause current or potential 
customers and users to 
believe that our systems are 
unreliable, leading them to 
avoid our technology 
 altogether, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions would increase the burden on our staff, which, 
 in turn, could delay our 
introduction of new applications and 
services. Finally, because our customers may use our products 
for critical 
 transactions, 
any 
system 
failures 
could 
result 
in 
damage 
to 
our 
customers 
businesses. 
These 
customers 
could 
seek 
significant 
 compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of 
claim could be time-consuming and costly for us to address. 
 Although certain of our systems 
have been designed to reduce 
downtime in the event of 
outages or catastrophic occurrences, they 
 remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication 
failures, terrorist attacks, 
 computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some of 
our systems are not fully 
redundant, and our disaster 
 recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. 

 Protection against fraud is of key 
importance to the purchasers and end 
users of our solutions. We 
incorporate security features, 
 including encryption 
software, biometric 
identification and 
secure hardware, 
into our solutions 
to protect 
against fraud in 
electronic 
 transactions and 
to provide for 
the privacy and 
integrity of cardholder 
data. Our solutions 
may be vulnerable 
to breaches in 
security 
 due to 
defects in 
the security 
mechanisms, the 
operating system 
and applications 
or the 
hardware platform. 
Security vulnerabilities 
 could 
jeopardize 
the 
security 
of 
information 
transmitted 
using 
our 
solutions. 
If 
the 
security 
of 
our 
solutions 
is 
compromised, 
our 
 reputation and marketplace acceptance 
of our solutions may be adversely 
affected, which would cause our 
business to suffer, 
and we 
 may become subject to damage claims. We 
have not yet experienced any significant security breaches affecting 
our business. 
 Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our 
system could 
 result in lengthy interruptions 
to our services. Our current 
business interruption insurance may 
not be sufficient to 
compensate us for 
 losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. 
 Cash 
Paymaster 
Services, 
or 
CPS, 
has 
been 
placed 
into 
liquidation. 
While 
no 
claim 
has 
been 
made 
 against Lesaka for CPS obligations, we cannot provide assurance that no such claim will be made. 

 CPS has significant obligations and ongoing litigation related to its SASSA contract and has been placed into liquidation. While 
 no claim has been made against Lesaka to be held liable for CPS current 
obligations or any future obligations under any future court 
 judgments, and while we do not believe that there would be a legitimate legal basis for any such claims, we cannot assure you that no 
 such claim 
will be 
made against 
us. If 
SASSA or 
another 
third party 
were to 
seek and 
ultimately succeed 
in obtaining 
a judgment 
 against us in respect of CPS liabilities, any such judgment would have a material 
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of 
 operations and cash flows.

14 
 Defending 
our 
intellectual 
property 
rights 
or 
defending 
ourselves 
in 
infringement 
suits 
that 
may 
be 
 brought against us is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. 

 Litigation to 
enforce our 
patents, trademarks 
or other 
intellectual property 
rights or 
to protect 
our trade 
secrets could 
result in 
 substantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of, or inability to protect, intellectual property in our technology could diminish 
 our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our 
 intellectual property 
rights to 
the same 
extent as 
do the 
laws in 
countries where 
we currently 
have patent 
protection. Our 
means of 
 protecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent or trademark protection, or any other country in 
 which we operate, may not be 
adequate to fully protect our intellectual 
property rights. Similarly, if third parties claim that we infringe 
 their intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant costs and 
devote substantial resources to the defense of such 
 claims, 
to 
discontinue 
using 
and 
selling 
any 
infringing 
technology 
and 
services, 
to 
expend 
resources 
to 
develop 
non-infringing 
 technology or 
to purchase 
licenses or 
pay royalties 
for other 
technology. 
In addition, 
if we 
are unsuccessful 
in defending 
any such 
 third-party 
claims, we 
could 
suffer 
costly judgments 
and 
injunctions 
that could 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
our business, 
results of 
 operations or financial condition.
 We 
may incur 
material losses 
in connection 
with our 
movement of 
cash through 
our infrastructure 
in 
 South Africa. 
 In our merchant 
business we collect 
and process large 
volumes of cash 
from our customers, 
assuming the 
risk of loss 
from the 
 moment that cash is 
deposited into our vaults. 
We are then responsible for its 
collection and transportation to 
processing centers, which 
 we outsource to various cash in transit service providers. These services extend 
across all areas of South Africa. 
 South Africa 
suffers from 
high levels of 
crime and in 
particular cash in 
transit heists. We 
cannot insure 
against certain risks 
of 
 loss or 
theft of 
cash from 
our delivery 
and collection 
vehicles and 
we will 
therefore bear 
the full 
cost of 
certain uninsured 
losses or 
 theft in connection with the cash handling process, and such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash 
 flows and results of operations. We 
have not incurred any material losses 
resulting from cash distribution in 
recent years, but there is 
 no assurance that we will not incur any such material losses in the future. 
 We depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, 
 which could harm our business. 
 We obtain 
our smart cards, ATMs, 
POS devices, components for our 
safe assets, and the other hardware 
we use in our business 
 from a limited number of 
suppliers, and do not 
manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term 
agreements 
 with our manufacturers 
or component suppliers. 
If our suppliers become 
unwilling or unable to 
provide us with adequate 
supplies of 
 parts or products when we need 
them, or if they increase their 
prices, we may not be 
able to find alternative sources in 
a timely manner 
 and could be faced 
with a critical shortage. 
This could harm our 
ability to meet customer 
demand and cause our 
revenues to decline. 
 Even 
if we 
are able 
to secure 
alternative 
sources in 
a timely 
manner, 
our costs 
could increase 
as a 
result of 
supply or 
geopolitical 
 shocks, which may lead to an increase in the prices of goods and services from third 
parties. A supply interruption, such as the current 
 global shortage of semiconductors, or an increase in 
demand beyond current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability 
to distribute 
 our equipment and thus 
to acquire new customers 
who use our technology. 
Any interruption in the supply 
of the hardware necessary 
 to operate 
our technology, 
or our 
inability to 
obtain substitute 
equipment at 
acceptable prices 
in a 
timely manner, 
could impair 
our 
 ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse 
effect on our business. 
 Our Smart Life business exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies. 
 Smart Life is a life insurance company and exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies. Some of these 
 risks 
include 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
we 
are 
able 
to 
continue 
to 
reinsure 
our 
risks 
at 
acceptable 
costs, 
reinsurer 
counterparty 
risk, 
 maintaining regulatory capital adequacy, solvency and 
liquidity requirements, our ability 
to price our 
insurance products appropriately, 
 the risk 
that actual 
claims experience 
may exceed 
our estimates, the 
ability to 
recover policy 
premiums from 
our customers 
and the 
 competitiveness of the South African insurance market. If we are unable to maintain our desired level of reinsurance 
at prices that we 
 consider acceptable, we would have to either 
accept an increase in our risk exposure 
or reduce our insurance writings. If our reinsurers 
 are unable 
to meet 
their commitments 
to us 
in a 
timely manner, 
or at 
all, we may 
be unable 
to discharge 
our obligations 
under our 
 insurance contracts. As such, we are exposed to counterparty risk, including 
credit risk, of these reinsurers. 
 Our 
product 
pricing 
includes 
long-term 
assumptions 
regarding 
investment 
returns, 
mortality, 
morbidity, 
persistency 
and 
 operating 
costs 
and 
expenses 
of 
the 
business. 
Using 
the 
wrong 
assumptions 
to 
price 
our 
insurance 
products 
could 
materially 
and 
 adversely affect our financial 
position, results of 
operations and cash flows. 
If our actual 
claims experience is 
higher than our 
estimates, 
 as we have seen 
during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, our 
financial position, results of operations and 
cash flows could be 
adversely 
 affected. Finally, the South African 
insurance industry is 
highly competitive. Many 
of our competitors 
are well-established, represented 
 nationally and market similar products and we therefore may not be able to 
effectively penetrate the South African insurance market. 

15 
 Risks Relating to Operating in South Africa and Other Foreign Markets 
 Operating in Southern Africa, 
an emerging market, subjects 
us to greater risks 
than those we would 
face 
 if we operated in more developed markets. 
 Emerging markets such as 
Southern Africa are subject 
to greater risks 
than more developed markets. 
While we focus 
our business 
 primarily 
on 
emerging 
markets 
because 
that 
is 
where 
we 
perceive 
the 
greatest 
opportunities 
to 
market 
our 
products 
and 
services 
 successfully, the political, economic and market conditions these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our 
 business successfully. 
 Some of these risks include: 
 
 political, legal and economic instability, 
including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations; 
 
 high levels of corruption, including bribery of public officials; 
 
 loss due to civil strife, acts of war or terrorism, guerrilla activities and insurrection; 
 
 a 
lack 
of 
well-developed 
legal 
systems 
which 
could 
make 
it 
difficult 
for 
us 
to 
enforce 
our 
intellectual 
property 
and 
 contractual rights; 
 
 logistical, utilities (including electricity and water supply) and communications 
challenges; 
 
 potential 
adverse 
changes 
in 
laws 
and 
regulatory 
practices, 
including 
import 
and 
export 
license 
requirements 
and 
 restrictions, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws; 
 
 difficulties in staffing and managing operations 
and ensuring the safety of our employees; 
 
 restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets; 
 
 greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; 
 
 indigenization and empowerment programs; 

exposure to liability under the UK Bribery Act; and 
 
 exposure to 
liability under 
U.S. securities 
and foreign 
trade laws, 
including the 
Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, 
or FCPA, 
 and regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury s 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. 
 If 
we 
do 
not 
achieve 
applicable 
Broad-Based 
Black 
Economic 
Empowerment 
objectives in 
our 
South 
 African businesses, we 
may be subject 
to fines and 
we risk losing 
our government and/or 
private contracts. 
 In addition, 
it is 
possible that 
we may 
be required 
to increase 
the Black 
shareholding of 
our company 
in a 
 manner that 
could dilute 
your ownership 
and/or change 
the companies 
from which 
we purchase 
goods or 
 procure services (to companies with a better BEE Status Level). 
 The legislative framework for the promotion of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment BEE ), in South Africa 
has been 
 established through 
the Broad-Based 
Black Economic 
Empowerment 
Act, No. 
53 of 
2003, as 
amended from 
time to 
time, and 
the 
 Amended 
BEE 
Codes 
of 
Good 
Practice, 
2013, 
or 
BEE 
Codes, 
and 
any 
sector-specific 
codes 
of 
good 
practice, 
or 
Sector 
Codes, 
 published pursuant 
thereto. Sector 
Codes are 
fully binding 
between and 
among businesses 
operating in 
a sector 
for which 
a Sector 
 Code has been 
published. Achievement 
of BEE objectives 
is measured by 
a scorecard which 
establishes a weighting 
for the various 
 elements. Scorecards 
are independently 
reviewed by 
accredited BEE 
verification agencies 
which issue 
a verification 
certificate that 
 presents an 
entity s

Level. This 
BEE verification 
process must 
be conducted 
on an 
annual basis, 
and the 
resultant BEE

We currently 
have 
 a level 5 BEE rating for our South African business. 
 Certain of our South African 
businesses are subject to either 
the Amended Information and 
Communication Technology 
Sector 
 Code, or ICT Sector Code, or the 
Amended Financial Services Sector Code, 
or the FS Sector Code. The ICT 
Sector Code and the FS 
 Sector Code have been amended and aligned with the new 
BEE Codes and were promulgated in November 2016 and December 
2017, 
 respectively. 
Licensing 
and/ 
or 
regulation 
authorities 
overseeing 
these 
South 
African 
businesses 
may 
set 
minimum 
adherence 
 requirements to BEE standards as a condition for an operating license to trade 
. 
 The BEE scorecard includes 
a component relating to management 
control, which serves to determine 
the participation of Black 
 people 
within 
the 
board, 
as 
well 
as 
at 
various 
levels 
of 
management 
within 
a 
measured 
entity 
(including, 
 inter 
alia
 , 
Executive 
 Management, Senior 
Management, Middle 
Management and 
Junior Management). 
The BEE 
Codes and/or 
Sector Codes 
define the 
 terms 
"
 Senior 
Management
 ", 
"
 Middle 
Management
 " 
and 
"
 Junior 
Management
 " 
as 
those 
occupational 
categories 
as 
determined 
in 
 accordance 
with 
the 
Employment 
Equity 
Regulations, 
with 
specific 
emphasis 
on 
improving 
participation 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
 demographics 
of the 
Economically Active 
Population 
of South 
Africa, 
as published 
by Statistics 
South 
Africa, 
from time 
to time. 
 Employment Equity legislation 
seeks to drive the 
alignment of the workforce 
with the racial composition 
of the economically active 
 population 
of 
South 
Africa 
and 
accelerate 
the 
achievement 
of 
employment 
equity 
targets, 
introducing 
monetary 
fines 
for 
non-
 compliance 
with 
the Employment 
Equity 
legislation 
and misrepresented 
submissions. 
Annexure 
EEA9 
to the 
Employment 
Equity 
 Regulations sets out the various occupational levels which are determined in accordance with the relevant grading systems applied by 
 the measured entity and referred to in said Annexure.

 We 
have taken a 
number of actions 
as a company 
to increase empowerment 
of Black (as 
defined under applicable 
regulations) 
 South Africans. 
For instance, 
the South 
African competition 
authorities approved 
the Connect 
transaction subject 
to certain 
public 
 interest conditions 
relating to 
employment, increasing 
the spread 
of ownership 
by historically 
disadvantaged people HDPs ), and 
 investing 
in both 
enterprise and 
supplier development. 
Further to 
increasing the 
spread of 
ownership 
by HDPs, 
we are 
required 
to 
 establish 
an 
Employee 
Share 
Ownership 
Plan 
scheme ESOP 
within 
36 
months 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
transaction 
that 
 complies with certain design principles. This will benefit the workers of the merged entity and result in them receiving a shareholding 
 in our 
company equal 
in value 
to at 
least 3 
of the 
issued shares 
in our 
company as 
of April 
14, 2022. 
If within 
24 months 
of the 
 implementation date of the transaction, we generate a positive net profit for three consecutive quarters, the ESOP shall increase to 5 
 of the issued 
shares in our company 
as of April 14, 
2022. The final structure 
of the ESOP is 
contingent on shareholder 
approval and 
 relevant regulatory and 
governance approvals. The 
ESOP had not been 
established as of the 
date of this Annual 
Report on Form 
10-
 K. 
 During fiscal 2023, we 
made a donation to 
The Association for Savings 
and Investment South Africa ASISA ), 
an organization 
 which serves as a unifying force for the South 
Africa's asset managers, collective investment scheme 
management companies, linked 
 investment service providers, multi-managers, and life insurance companies. We 
provided donations to eight of our suppliers in order 
 to enable 
them to 
promote growth 
and strengthen 
their capacity 
to provide 
valuable products 
and services 
to the 
market they 
serve. 
 We 
also contributed 
to a 
non-profit organization 
that focuses 
on education, 
health services, 
and sports 
development in 
underserved 
 communities, and we 
believe our contribution 
creates a positive impact 
on society and promoting 
holistic development among 
those 
 who face 
challenges in accessing 
essential resources. 
However, 
it is possible 
that these actions 
may not 
be sufficient 
to enable us 
to 
 achieve the applicable BEE objectives set out for specific 
financial years. In that event, in order to 
maintain competitiveness with both 
 government 
and 
private 
sector 
clients, 
we 
may 
have 
to 
seek 
to 
increase 
compliance 
through 
other 
means, 
including 
by 
selling 
or 
 placing additional 
shares of Lesaka 
or of our 
South African subsidiaries 
to Black 
South Africans 
(either directly 
or indirectly), 
over 
 and above what 
has already been 
approved. Such sales 
or placements of 
shares could have 
a dilutive impact 
on your ownership 
interest, 
 which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. 
 We 
expect that our 
BEE Status Level 
will be important 
in order for 
us to remain 
competitive in the 
South African marketplace 
 and we continually 
seek ways to 
improve our BEE 
Status Level, especially 
the ownership element 
(so-called equity element 
thereof. 

 We 
may not be 
able to effectively 
and efficiently 
manage the disruption 
to our operations 
as a result 
of 
 erratic electricity supply in 
South Africa, which could 
adversely affect our, financial position, cash flows 
and 
 future growth. 
 Our businesses in 
South Africa are 
dependent on electricity 
generated and supplied 
by the state-owned 
utility, 
Eskom, in order 
 to operate, and Eskom has been unable to generate and 
supply the amount of electricity required by the South African economy which 
 has resulted in significant and 
often unpredictable electricity supply disruptions. Eskom has 
implemented a number of short- and 
long-
 term mitigation plans 
to correct these issues 
but supply disruptions 
continue to occur 
regularly and with 
no predictability. 
As part of 
 our 
business continuity 
programs, we 
have 
installed back-up 
diesel generators 
in order 
for 
us to 
continue 
to operate 
our 
core data 
 processing 
facilities 
in 
the 
event 
of 
intermittent 
disruptions 
to 
our 
electricity 
supply. 
We 
have 
to 
perform 
regular 
monitoring 
and 
 maintenance of these 
generators and also 
source and manage 
diesel fuel levels. 
We 
may also be 
required to replace 
these generators 
 on a more frequent basis due to the additional burden placed on them. 
 Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows 
and future growth could be adversely affected if Eskom is 
unable to raise 
 sufficient funding to operate 
and/or commission new electricity-generating 
power stations in accordance with its 
plans, or at all, or if 
 we are unable to effectively and efficiently test, maintain, 
source fuel for, and replace, our generators. 
 Fluctuations in 
the value 
of the 
South African 
rand have 
had, and 
will continue 
to have, 
a significant 
 impact 
on 
our 
reported 
results 
of 
operations, 
which 
may 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
evaluate 
our 
business 
 performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect our stock price. 
 The South 
African rand, 
or ZAR, 
is the 
primary operating 
currency for 
our business 
operations while 
our financial 
results are 
 reported in U.S. dollars. Therefore, any depreciation in 
the ZAR against the U.S. dollar, would negatively impact 
our reported revenue 
 and net 
income. The 
U.S. dollar/ZAR 
exchange rate 
has historically 
been volatile 
and we 
expect this 
volatility to 
continue (refer 
to 
 Item 
7 Management s 
Discussion 
and 
Analysis 
of 
Financial 
Condition 
and 
Results 
of 
Operations Currency 
Exchange 
Rate 
 Information. ). 
Due 
to 
the 
significant 
fluctuation 
in 
the 
value 
of 
the 
ZAR 
and 
its 
impact 
on 
our 
reported 
results, 
you 
may 
find 
it 
 difficult to 
compare our results 
of operations between 
financial reporting periods 
even though we 
provide supplemental information 
 about our 
results of 
operations determined 
on a 
ZAR basis. 
Similarly, 
depreciation in 
the ZAR 
may negatively 
impact the 
prices at 
 which our stock trades. 
 We generally do not engage in any currency hedging 
transactions intended to reduce the 
effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
 exchange rates on our results of 
operations, other than economic hedging 
using forward contracts relating to 
our inventory purchases 
 which are settled in U.S. 
dollars or euros. We 
cannot guarantee that we will 
enter into hedging transactions 
in the future or, 
if we do, 
 that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations. 

17 
 South Africa s 
high levels of 
poverty, unemployment 
and crime may 
increase our costs 
and impair our 
 ability to maintain a qualified workforce 
 While South Africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure, it also has high levels of crime and unemployment, 
 relative to peer 
countries in Africa 
and other emerging 
economies, and there 
are significant differences 
in the level 
of economic and 
 social development among its people, 
with large parts of the population, 
particularly in rural areas, having limited 
access to adequate 
 education, healthcare, housing and other 
basic services, including water 
and electricity. In addition, South Africa has 
a high prevalence 
 of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of 
 citizens 
under 
previous 
governments 
may 
increase 
our 
costs and 
reduce 
our 
profitability, 
all of 
which 
could 
negatively 
affect 
our 
 business. 
These 
problems 
may 
prompt 
emigration 
of 
skilled 
workers, 
hinder 
investment 
into 
South 
Africa 
and 
impede 
economic 
 growth. As a result, we may have difficulties attracting and retaining 
qualified employees. 
 The 
economy 
of 
South 
Africa 
is 
exposed 
to 
high 
rates 
of 
inflation, 
interest 
and 
corporate 
tax, 
which 
 could 
increase 
our 
operating 
costs 
and 
thereby 
reduce 
our 
profitability. 
Furthermore, 
the 
South 
African 
 government requires additional 
income to fund 
future government 
expenditures and may 
be required, 
among 
 other things, to 
increase existing income 
tax rates, including 
the corporate income tax 
rate, amend existing 
 tax legislation or introduce additional taxes. 
 The economy of 
South Africa in the 
past has been, and 
in the future may 
continue to be, characterized 
by rates of inflation 
and 
 interest that 
are substantially 
higher than 
those prevailing 
in the United 
States and 
other highly-developed 
economies. High 
rates of 
 inflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. High interest rates increase the cost of our 
 debt financing, though conversely, they also 
increase the amount 
of income we 
earn on any 
cash balances. The 
South African corporate 
 income tax rate, of 27 , is higher than the 
U.S. federal income tax rate, of 21 . Any increase 
in the effective South African corporate 
 income tax rate would adversely impact our profitability and cash flow generation. 
 Risks Relating to Government Regulation 
 We 
are required to 
comply with 
certain laws 
and regulations, including 
economic and trade 
sanctions, 
 which could adversely impact our future growth. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to U.S. 
and 
other 
trade 
controls, 
economic sanctions 
and 
similar 
laws and 
regulations, 
including 
those in 
the 
 jurisdictions 
where 
we 
operate. 
Our 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
these 
laws 
and 
regulations 
could 
subject 
us 
to 
civil, 
criminal 
and 
 administrative 
penalties 
and 
harm 
our 
reputation. 
These 
laws and 
regulations 
place 
restrictions 
on 
our 
operations, 
trade 
practices, 
 partners 
and 
investment 
decisions. 
In particular, 
our operations 
are subject 
to U.S. 
and 
foreign 
trade 
control laws 
and 
regulations, 
 including various export controls and economic sanctions programs, such as those administered by OFAC. We monitor compliance in 
 accordance with 
the 10 
principles as 
set out 
in the 
United Nations 
Global Compact 
Principles, the 
Organisation 
for Economic 
Co-
 operation and 
Development recommendations 
relating to 
corruption, and 
the International 
Labor Organization 
Protocol in 
terms of 
 certain of the items to be 
monitored. As a result of doing business 
in foreign countries and with foreign 
partners, we are exposed to a 
 heightened risk of violating trade control laws as well as sanctions regulations. 
 Violations 
of 
trade 
control 
laws and 
sanctions 
regulations 
are 
punishable 
by civil 
penalties, 
including 
fines, 
denial 
of export 
 privileges, 
injunctions, 
asset seizures, 
debarment 
from 
government 
contracts 
and revocations 
or restrictions 
of licenses, 
as 
well 
as 
 criminal fines and imprisonment. 
We have 
developed policies and procedures as 
part of a company-wide compliance 
program that is 
 designed to 
assist our compliance 
with applicable 
U.S. and international 
trade control laws 
and regulations, 
including trade controls 
 and sanctions programs administered 
by OFAC, 
and provide regular training 
to our employees to create awareness 
about the risks of 
 violations of trade 
control laws and 
sanctions regulations and 
to ensure compliance 
with these laws 
and regulations. 
However, there 
 can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, 
partners, agents or other associated persons will not act in violation 
of our 
 policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and 
procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations 
 in every transaction 
in which we 
may engage, or 
provide a defense 
to any alleged 
violation. In particular, 
we may be 
held liable for 
 the actions that our 
local, strategic or joint venture 
partners take inside or outside 
of the United States, even 
though our partners may 
 not be 
subject to 
these laws. 
Such a 
violation, even 
if our 
policies prohibit 
it, could 
materially and 
adversely affect 
our reputation, 
 business, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
financial 
condition. 
Any 
expansion 
into 
developing 
countries, 
and 
our 
development 
of 
new 
 partnerships and joint venture relationships, could increase the risk 
of OFAC violations in the 
future. 
 In addition, 
our payment 
processing and 
financial services 
activities are 
subject to 
extensive 
regulation. 
Compliance with 
the 
 requirements under the various 
regulatory regimes may cause 
us to incur significant 
additional costs and failure 
to comply with such 
 requirements could result in the shutdown of 
the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or 
criminal liability.

18 
 We 
are 
required 
to 
comply 
with 
anti-corruption 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
including 
the 
FCPA 
and 
UK 
 Bribery Act, in the 
jurisdictions in which we 
operate our business, which could 
adversely impact our future 
 growth. 
 The FCPA prohibits 
us from providing anything of value to foreign 
officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, 
 or 
securing 
any 
improper 
business 
advantage, 
and 
requires 
us 
to 
keep 
books 
and 
records 
that 
accurately 
and 
fairly 
reflect 
our 
 transactions. 
As part 
of 
our 
business, 
we 
may 
deal 
with 
state-owned 
business 
enterprises, 
the 
employees 
of 
which 
are 
considered 
 foreign 
officials 
for 
purposes of 
the FCPA. 
The UK 
Bribery 
Act includes 
provisions 
that extend 
beyond bribery 
of foreign 
public 
 officials and also apply to 
transactions with individuals not employed 
by a government and 
the act is also 
more onerous than the FCPA 
 in a number of other respects, including 
jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation 
payments and penalties. Some of the international 
 locations in which we operate or have investments lack a developed 
legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. 
 Any 
failure 
by 
us 
to 
adopt 
appropriate 
compliance 
procedures 
and 
ensure 
that 
our 
employees, 
agents 
and 
business 
partners 
 comply with 
the anti-corruption 
laws and 
regulations could 
subject us 
to substantial 
penalties, and 
the requirement 
that we 
comply 
 with these laws could 
put us at a 
competitive disadvantage against 
companies that are not 
required to comply. 
For example, in many 
 emerging 
markets, 
there 
may be 
significant 
levels 
of official 
corruption, 
and 
thus, bribery 
of public 
officials 
may 
be 
a comm 
only 
 accepted cost 
of doing 
business. Our 
refusal to 
engage in 
illegal behavior, 
such as 
paying bribes, 
may result 
in us not 
being able 
to 
 obtain business that we 
might otherwise have been able 
to secure or possibly 
even result in unlawful, 
selective or arbitrary action being 
 taken against us. 
 Violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and 
 imprisonment. We 
have developed policies 
and procedures as part 
of a company-wide 
compliance program that 
is designed to assist 
 our compliance with applicable U.S., 
South African and other international 
anti-corruption laws and regulations, 
and provide regular 
 training to our 
employees to comply 
with these laws 
and regulations. However, 
there can be 
no assurance that 
all of our 
employees, 
 consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies or 
these laws and regulations, 
 or that our 
policies and procedures 
will effectively prevent 
us from violating 
these regulations in every 
transaction in which 
we may 
 engage, or 
provide a defense 
to any alleged 
violation. In 
particular, 
we may be 
held liable for 
the actions 
that our 
local, strategic 
or 
 joint venture 
partners take inside 
or outside 
of the United 
States, even though 
our partners may 
not be subject 
to these 
laws. Such a 
 violation, 
even 
if 
our 
policies 
prohibit 
it, 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
reputation, 
business, 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
 financial condition. 
 We 
do not 
have a South 
African banking license 
and, therefore, we 
provide our EPE 
solution through 
 an arrangement with 
a third-party bank, 
which limits our 
control over this 
business and the 
economic benefit 
 we derive from it. 
If this arrangement were 
to terminate, we would 
not be able to operate 
our EPE business 
 without alternate means of access to a banking license. 
 The 
South 
African 
retail 
banking 
market 
is 
highly 
regulated. 
Under 
current 
law 
and 
regulations, 
our 
EasyPay 
Everywhere 
 EPE business activities require 
us to be registered as 
a bank in South Africa 
or to have access to an 
existing banking license. 
We 
 are not currently so registered, 
but we have an agreement 
with Grindrod Bank, a subsidiary 
of African Bank Limited, that 
enables us 
 to implement 
our EPE 
program in 
compliance 
with the 
relevant laws 
and regulations. 
If this 
agreement 
were to 
be terminated, 
we 
 would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
operate 
these 
services 
unless 
we 
were 
able 
to 
obtain 
access 
to 
a 
banking 
license 
through 
alternate 
means. 
 Furthermore, we 
have to 
comply with 
the strict 
anti-money laundering 
and customer 
identification regulations 
of the South 
African 
 Reserve Bank SARB ), 
when we open 
new bank accounts 
for our customers 
and when they 
transact. Failure to 
effectively implement 
 and monitor responses to these regulations may result in significant fines or prosecution 
of Grindrod Bank and ourselves. 

 In 
addition, 
the 
South 
African 
Financial 
Advisory 
and 
Intermediary 
Services 
Act, 
2002, 
requires 
persons 
who 
act 
as 
 intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers 
in South Africa to register 
as financial service providers. Smart 
Life 
 was granted an Authorized Financial Service Provider, or FSP, 
license on June 9, 2015, and EasyPay Financial Services (Pty) Ltd and 
 Net1 
Mobile 
Solutions 
(Pty) Ltd 
were 
each granted 
FSP licenses 
on 
July 
11, 
2017. 
If 
our 
FSP licenses 
are 
cancelled, 
we 
may 
be 
 stopped from continuing our financial 
services businesses in South Africa
 unless we are able 
to enter into a 
representative arrangement 
 with a third party FSP. 
 Furthermore, the proposed 
Conduct of Financial 
Institutions Bill will make 
significant changes to 
the current licensing 
regime. 
 The second 
draft of 
the Conduct 
of Financial 
Institutions Bill 
was published 
for public 
comment on 
29 September 
2020. While 
the 
 proposals currently 
indicate that 
existing licenses 
will be converted, 
if we are 
not successful in 
our efforts 
to obtain 
a conversion 
of 
 the existing 
licenses or 
cannot comply 
with the 
new conduct 
standards to 
be published 
at the 
same time 
under the 
Financial Sector 
 Regulation Act, No. 9 of 2017, we may be stopped from continuing 
our financial services businesses in South Africa. 

19 
 We 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
regulations 
regarding 
privacy, 
data 
use 
and/or 
security, 
which 
could 
adversely 
 affect our business.

We are 
subject to regulations in 
a number of the countries 
in which we operate 
relating to the processing 
(which includes, 
 inter 
 alia
 , the collection, use, retention, security and transfer) of 
personal information about the people (whether natural or juristic) 
who use 
 our products 
and services. 
The interpretation 
and application 
of user 
data protection 
laws are 
in a 
state of 
flux. These 
laws may 
be 
 interpreted 
and 
applied 
inconsistently 
from 
country 
to 
country 
and 
our 
current 
data 
protection 
policies 
and 
practices 
may 
not 
be 
 consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying 
with these varying requirements could cause us to incur 
substantial 
 costs or 
require us 
to change 
our business 
practices in 
a manner 
adverse to 
our business. 
Any failure, 
or perceived 
failure, by 
us to 
 comply with any regulatory requirements or international 
privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could 
result in 
 proceedings 
or 
actions 
against 
us 
by 
governmental 
entities 
or 
others, 
subject 
us 
to 
significant 
penalties 
and 
negative 
publicity. 
In 
 addition, as 
noted above, 
we are 
subject to 
the possibility 
of security 
breaches, which 
themselves may 
result in 
a violation 
of these 
 laws. 
 Amendments to 
the NCA 
were signed into 
law in 
South Africa 
in August 2019. 
Compliance with 
these 
 amendments may adversely impact our micro-lending operations in South Africa. 

In August 2019, the National Credit Amendment Bill, or debt-relief bill, was signed into law in South Africa. 
The effective date 
 of the debt-relief 
bill has not 
yet been announced 
and has been 
significantly delayed. 
We 
believe that the 
debt-relief bill will 
restrict 
 the ability of financial services providers to provide lending 
products to certain low-income earners and will increase the 
cost of credit 
 to 
these 
consumers. 
As a 
result, 
compliance 
with 
the debt 
-relief 
bill 
may 
adversely 
impact 
our 
micro-lending 
operations 
in 
South 
 Africa. Furthermore, we expect that it will take us, and other financial services providers, some time to fully understand, interpret and 
 implement this new legislation in 
our lending processes and practices. 
Non-compliance with the provisions of this 
new legislation may 
 result in financial loss and penalties, reputational loss or other administrative 
punishment. 
 Risks Relating to our Common Stock 
 If we were 
deemed an investment 
company under the 
Investment Company Act, 
applicable restrictions 
 could make it impractical for 
us to conduct our business as 
an operating company and could 
have a material 
 adverse effect on our business. 
 We 
are an operating 
company whose business is 
focused on developing 
and offering payment 
solutions, transaction processing 
 services and financial technologies across 
multiple industries directly and through 
our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our conduct, 
public 
 filings and 
announcements 
hold us 
out as 
such an 
operating 
company 
and 
do not 
hold 
us out 
as being 
engaged 
in the 
business of 
 investing, reinvesting or trading 
in securities. We own, and 
in the 
past have owned, 
certain assets that 
may be deemed 
to be 
 investment 
 securities within 
the meaning 
of Section 
3(a)(2) of 
the Investment 
Company 
Act. The 
fluctuating 
value of 
our assets 
that may 
be 
 deemed to be investment securities, could cause us to be deemed to be an 
 investment company under the Investment Company Act 
 if the value of such investment securities exceeds certain defined thresholds. 

 If we are deemed 
an investment company 
and not entitled to 
an exception or 
exemption from registration 
under the Investment 
 Company Act, we would have to register as 
an investment company, modify our asset profile or otherwise change our business so that 
 it falls outside 
the definition 
of an investment 
company under the 
Investment Company 
Act. Registering as 
an investment 
company 
 pursuant to 
the Investment 
Company Act 
could, among 
other things, 
materially limit 
our ability 
to borrow 
funds or 
engage in 
other 
 transactions and 
otherwise would 
subject us 
to substantial 
and costly 
regulation. Failure 
to register, 
if required, 
would significantly 
 impair our ability to continue to engage in our business and would have a material 
adverse impact on our business and operations. 
 Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. 
 Our stock price has periodically experienced significant volatility. During the 2023 fiscal year, our stock 
price ranged from a low 
 of 3.02 to a high of 5.97. We 
expect that the trading price of our common stock may 
continue to be volatile as a result of a number 
 of factors, including, but not limited to the following: 
 
 any adverse developments in litigation or regulatory actions in which we are 
involved; 
 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange 
rate; 
 
 announcement 
of 
additional 
BEE 
transactions, 
especially 
one 
involving 
the 
issuance 
or 
potential 
issuance 
of 
equity 
 securities or dilution or sale of our existing business in South Africa; 
 
 quarterly variations in our operating results; 
 
 significant fair value adjustments or impairment in respect of investments or 
intangible assets; 
 
 announcements of acquisitions or disposals; 
 
 the timing of, or delays in the commencement, implementation or completion 
of major projects; 
 
 large purchases or sales of our common stock; and 
 
 general conditions in the markets in which we operate. 

20 
 Additionally, 
shares of 
our common 
stock can 
be expected 
to be 
subject to 
volatility resulting 
from purely 
market forces 
over 
 which we have no control. 
 The put 
right we granted 
to the IFC 
Investors on the 
occurrence of certain 
triggering events may 
have 
 adverse impacts on us. 
 In May 
2016, we 
issued an 
aggregate of 
9,984,311 
shares of 
our common 
stock to 
the IFC Investors, 
of which, 
as of 
June 30, 
 2023, 
the 
IFC 
Investors 
held 
7,366,866 
shares. 
We 
granted 
the 
IFC 
Investors 
certain 
rights, 
including 
the 
right 
to 
require 
us 
to 
 repurchase 
any 
share held 
by the 
IFC Investors 
pursuant 
to 
the 
May 
2016 transaction 
upon 
the occurrence 
of specified 
triggering 
 events, 
which 
we refer 
to as 
a 
 put 
right. 
The put 
price 
per share 
will be 
the higher 
of the 
price 
per share 
paid 
to us 
by 
the IFC 
 Investors and 
the volume-weighted 
average price 
per share prevailing 
for the 60 
trading days preceding 
the triggering 
event, except 
 that with respect 
to a put right 
triggered by rejection 
of a bona 
fide offer, 
the put price 
per share will 
be the highest 
price offered 
by 
 the offeror. 
If a put triggering event occurs, it could adversely impact 
our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, the 
existence of 
 the put right could also affect whether or on what terms a third party might in the future offer to purchase our company. 
Our response 
 to any such offer could also be complicated, delayed or otherwise influenced 
by the existence of the put right. 
 Approximately 
37 
of 
our 
outstanding 
common 
stock 
is 
owned by 
two shareholders. 
The 
interests of 
 these shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders. 
 There is a concentration of ownership 
of our outstanding common stock because 
approximately 37 of our outstanding common 
 stock is owned by two 
shareholders. Based on their most 
recent SEC filings disclosing 
ownership of our shares, Value Capital Partners 
 (Pty) Ltd, or VCP, 
and IFC Investors, beneficially own approximately 25 and 12 of our outstanding common 
stock as of June 30, 
 2023, respectively. 
 The interests of 
VCP and the 
IFC Investors may 
be different 
from or conflict 
with the interests 
of our other 
shareholders. As a 
 result of 
the significant 
combined ownership 
by VCP 
and the 
IFC Investors, 
they may 
be able, 
if they 
act together, 
to significantly 
 influence the 
voting outcome 
of all 
matters requiring 
shareholder approval. 
This concentration 
of ownership 
may have 
the effect 
of 
 delaying or preventing 
a change of control of 
our company, 
thus depriving shareholders 
of a premium for 
their shares, or facilitating 
 a change of control that other shareholders may oppose. 
 We may seek to raise 
additional financing by 
issuing new securities 
with terms or 
rights superior to 
those 
 of shares of our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of such shares. 
 We 
may require 
additional financing 
to fund future 
operations, including 
expansion in 
current and new 
markets, programming 
 development and acquisition, 
capital costs and 
the costs of any 
necessary implementation of 
technological innovations or 
alternative 
 technologies, or to fund acquisitions. We may also wish to raise additional equity funding to 
reduce the amount of debt funding on our 
 balance sheet. Because of the exposure to market risks associated 
with economies in emerging markets, we may not 
be able to obtain 
 financing on favorable terms or at all. 
If we raise additional funds by 
issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our 
current 
 shareholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of 
 common stock, 
which could 
adversely affect 
the market 
price and 
voting power 
of shares 
of common 
stock. If 
we raise 
additional 
 funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior 
to those of the holders of 
 shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and 
create a significant interest 
 expense for us. 
 Issuances 
of significant 
amounts of 
stock in 
the future 
could potentially 
dilute 
your equity 
ownership 
 and adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
 We 
believe that 
it is necessary 
to maintain 
a sufficient 
number of 
available authorized 
shares of our 
common stock 
in order 
to 
 provide 
us 
with 
the flexibility 
to 
issue shares 
for 
business 
purposes 
that 
may 
arise 
from time 
to 
time. 
For example, 
we 
could 
sell 
 additional shares to raise 
capital to fund our 
operations, to reduce debt 
or to acquire other 
businesses, issue shares in 
a BEE transaction, 
 issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend. Our board may authorize 
the issuance of additional 
 shares of common stock without notice to, or further 
action by, our shareholders, unless shareholder approval is required by law or the 
 rules of the NASDAQ Stock 
Market. The issuance of additional 
shares could dilute the equity 
ownership of our current shareholders 
 and any such additional shares would likely be freely tradable, which could 
adversely affect the trading price of our common 
stock.

21 
 Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial 
reporting in accordance with Section 404 
 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, especially 
over companies 
that we 
may acquire, 
could have 
a material 
adverse 
 effect on our business and stock price. 
 Under Section 404 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002, 
or Sarbanes, we 
are required to 
furnish a management 
certification and 
 auditor attestation regarding the 
effectiveness of our internal 
control over financial reporting. 
We are 
required to report, among other 
 things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness 
or changes in internal control that 
materially affect, or are reasonably 
 likely 
to 
materially 
affect, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting. 
A 
 material 
weakness 
is 
a 
deficiency, 
or 
a 
combination 
of 
 deficiencies, in internal 
control over financial 
reporting such that 
there is a 
reasonable possibility that 
a material misstatement 
of annual 
 or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on 
a timely basis. 
 The 
requirement 
to 
evaluate 
and 
report 
on 
our 
internal 
controls 
also 
applies 
to 
companies 
that 
we 
acquire. 
Some 
of 
these 
 companies may not 
be required 
to comply with 
Sarbanes prior 
to the 
time we 
acquire them. 
The integration of 
these acquired 
companies 
 into our internal 
control over financial 
reporting could require 
significant time and 
resources from our 
management and other 
personnel 
 and may increase our compliance costs. 
If we fail to successfully 
integrate the operations of these 
acquired companies into our internal 
 control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting 
may not be effective. 
 While 
we 
continue 
to 
dedicate 
resources 
and 
management 
time 
to 
ensuring 
that 
we 
have 
effective 
controls 
over 
financial 
 reporting, failure to 
achieve and maintain 
an effective internal 
control environment could 
have a material 
adverse effect on 
the market s 
 perception of our business and our stock price. 
 You 
may 
experience 
difficulties 
in 
effecting 
service 
of 
legal 
process, 
enforcing 
foreign 
judgments 
or 
 bringing 
original 
actions 
based 
upon 
U.S. 
laws, 
including 
federal 
securities 
laws 
or 
other 
foreign 
laws, 
 against us or certain of our directors and officers and experts. 

 While Lesaka is incorporated in the state of Florida, United States, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa 
 and substantially all of the company s 
assets are located outside the United 
States. In addition, the majority of 
Lesaka s directors 
and 
 all 
its 
officers 
reside 
outside 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
our 
experts, 
including 
our 
independent 
registered 
public 
 accountants, are based in South Africa. 
 As a 
result, even 
though you 
could effect 
service of 
legal process 
upon Lesaka, 
as a 
Florida corporation, 
in the 
United States, 
 you may not be able 
to collect any judgment obtained 
against Lesaka in the United 
States, including any judgment based 
on the civil 
 liability 
provisions 
of 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws, 
because 
substantially 
all 
of 
our 
assets 
are 
located 
outside 
the 
United 
States. 
 Moreover, it may not be possible for 
you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of 
our directors and officers or upon our 
 experts within 
the United 
States or 
elsewhere outside 
South Africa 
and any 
judgment obtained 
against any 
of our 
foreign directors, 
 officers and experts in 
the United States, including 
one based on the 
civil liability provisions of the 
U.S. federal securities laws, 
may 
 not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by a South 
African court. 
 South Africa 
is not 
a party 
to any 
treaties regarding 
the enforcement 
of foreign 
commercial judgments, 
as opposed 
to foreign 
 arbitral awards. Accordingly, a foreign judgment that 
is not recognized in 
South Africa has 
no extra territorial effect, and 
is not directly 
 enforceable in South Africa, but 
constitutes a cause of action 
which may be recognized and enforced 
by South African courts provided 
 that: 
 
 the court which 
pronounced the judgment 
had international jurisdiction 
and competence to entertain 
the case according to 
 the principles recognized by South African law with reference to the jurisdiction 
of foreign courts; 

the judgment is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot be altered by the court which 
pronounced it); 

the judgment has not lapsed; 
 
 the recognition and 
enforcement of the 
judgment by South African 
courts would not 
be contrary to public 
policy in South 
 Africa, including observance of the rules of natural justice which require 
that no award is enforceable unless the defendant 
 was duly served with documents 
initiating proceedings, that he 
or she was given a 
fair opportunity to be 
heard and that he 
 or she enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial 
tribunal; 

the judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means; 
 
 the 
judgment 
does 
not involve 
the 
enforcement 
of a 
penal 
or 
foreign 
revenue 
law or 
any 
award 
of multiple 
or punitive 
 damages; and 

the enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of 
the Protection of Business Act 99 of 1978 
 (as amended), of the Republic of South Africa. 
 It has been the policy 
of South African courts to award 
compensation for the loss or damage 
actually sustained by the person 
to 
 whom the compensation is awarded. South African courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as 
 a result 
of a 
diminution in 
the value 
of their 
shares based 
on various 
actions by 
the corporation 
and its 
management. Although 
the 
 award 
of punitive 
damages 
is generally 
unenforceable 
in the 
South 
African legal 
system, that 
does not 
mean 
that such 
awards are 
 necessarily 
contrary 
to 
public 
policy. 
The 
award 
of 
punitive 
damages 
is 
governed 
by 
the 
relevant 
South 
African 
legislation, 
the 
 Conventional Penalties Act 15 of 1962 (as amended). 

22 
 Whether a judgment 
was contrary to 
public policy 
depends on the 
facts of each 
case. Exorbitant, 
unconscionable, or 
excessive 
 awards will generally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot 
 act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. Further, if a foreign judgment is enforced by a South African court, 
it will be 
 payable in South African currency unless approval is obtained from SARB or an Authorised Dealer of SARB, to settle the judgement 
 in another 
currency. 
Also, under 
South Africa s 
exchange control 
laws, the 
approval of 
SARB or 
an Authorised 
Dealer is 
required 
 before a defendant 
resident in South Africa 
may pay money to 
a non-resident plaintiff 
in satisfaction of a 
foreign judgment enforced 
 by a court in South Africa. 

 It is 
doubtful 
whether an 
original action 
based on 
United States 
federal 
securities laws 
may 
be brought 
before South 
African 
 courts. A plaintiff who 
is not resident in South Africa may 
be required to provide security for 
costs in the event of proceedings being 
 initiated in 
South Africa. 
Furthermore, the 
Rules of 
the High 
Court of 
South Africa 
require that 
documents executed 
outside South 
 Africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in South African courts. In reaching the foregoing conclusions in respect of South 
 Africa, we consulted with our South African legal counsel, Werksmans 
Inc.

 Overview 
 We are a provider of financial technology, 
or fintech, products and services to unbanked and underbanked individuals and small 
 businesses, predominantly 
in South Africa. 
We 
have developed and 
own most of 
our payment technologies, 
and where possible, 
we 
 utilize this technology to 
provide financial and 
value-added services to 
our customers by 
including them in the 
formal financial system. 
 Sources of Revenue 
 We 
generate our 
revenues by 
charging 
transaction fees 
to merchants, 
financial service 
providers, utility 
providers, bill 
issuers 
 and consumers; 
by selling 
pinned airtime 
to merchants; 
by providing 
loans to 
merchants and 
consumers, and 
insurance products 
to 
 consumers and by selling hardware, licensing software and providing 
related technology services to merchants. 
 We act 
as a service provider whereby we 
own and operate the technology and 
apply it in a system ourselves, 
charging one-time 
 and ongoing fees for the use of the system either on 
a fixed or ad valorem basis. For instance, through 
the acquisition of Connect, we 
 now provide cash management and payment services to merchant customers through a digital vault (safe asset) which is located at the 
 customer s premises and 
generate processing revenue from 
the provision of these services. 
We also 
offer merchant customers 
access 
 to platforms through 
which we (a) generate 
revenue from the sale 
of prepaid airtime and 
(b) generate fees from 
distribution of VAS, 
 including prepaid 
airtime, prepaid 
electricity, 
gaming voucher, 
and other 
services, to 
users of 
our platforms. 
We 
also generate 
fees 
 from debit 
and credit 
card transaction 
processing and 
interest revenue 
from qualifying 
merchant 
customers 
who are 
able to 
access 
 short-term loans. The revenue and costs associated with these services and 
sales are included in our merchant operating segment. 
 We 
provide consumers with 
bank accounts from 
which we generate 
a monthly fee 
and also charge 
fees on an ad 
valorem basis 
 for goods 
and services 
purchased. Usage 
of our 
bank accounts 
also provides 
our customers 
with access 
to short-term 
loans and 
life 
 insurance products. 
We 
also generate 
fees from 
consumers utilizing 
our ATM 
network. The 
revenue and 
costs associated 
with this 
 approach are reflected in our consumer operating segment. 
 Developments during Fiscal 2023 
 Fiscal 2023 represents a milestone for Lesaka. We 
made significant progress in our turnaround strategy and delivered continued 
 growth for Lesaka despite challenging macroeconomic and socio-political 
conditions. 

 We 
reported a 
net loss 
attributable to 
us of 
 35.1 million 
(ZAR 629.2 
million) during 
fiscal 2023 
compared with 
a net 
loss of 
 43.9 million (ZAR 666.8 million) during fiscal 2022. Our Consumer Division Consumer returned to 
profitability and contributed 
 three 
sequential 
quarters 
of 
positive

South Africa s grant beneficiaries 
 by providing access 
to innovative financial 
technology and value

 Merchant Division outperformance 
 Our Merchant Division has 
shown significant growth in our offering 
to MSME, which is supported 
by the robust secular trends 
 underpinning financial inclusion, cash management and digitalization 
for MSMEs. 

 Performance in our Merchant division has been driven by: 
 
 Kazang, which is our VAS and Supplier Payments Business, has seen 
strong adoption by MSMEs in 
the informal sector, with 
 a 47 year-on-year 
growth in the 
number of devices 
deployed. We 
had approximately 
75,000 devices deployed 
as of June 
 30, 2023, compared to approximately 51,000 devices one year ago; 
 
 We 
provide card acquiring 
solutions in the informal 
sector via Kazang 
Pay and in 
the formal sector we 
provide this service 
 through 
Card 
Connect. 
Card-enabled 
POS 
devices 
increased 
to 
approximately 
44,900 
as 
of 
June 
30, 
2023, 
compared 
to 
 approximately 22,650 a year ago, a growth of 98 in deployed devices; 

We provide merchants access to credit through Capital 
Connect and Kazang Pay 
Advance. We continue to see strong demand 
 for this merchant 
credit offering 
and disbursed 
just over ZAR 
1.0 billion 
during the 
year, compared 
to approximately 
ZAR 
 0.6 billion in the comparable period last year, representing 
growth of 62 . 
 
 Our automated cash management and payments business, Cash 
Connect, effectively puts the bank in approximately 
4,390 
 merchants stores (compared to approximately 4,080 merchants 
stores a year ago). Cash 
Connect is a provider of 
robust cash 
 vaults in the 
formal sector, 
and is building 
a presence 
in the informal 
sector. 
Cash Connect enables 
our merchant 
customer 
 base to significantly mitigate their operational risks pertaining to cash management 
and security. 

 Consumer Division contributing sequential positive Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
and poised for growth 
 Over the past four quarters we have consistently referenced the 
three levers underpinning our strategy of returning the Consumer 
 Division 
to 
profitability 
- 
growing 
active 
EasyPay 
Everywhere EPE 
account 
numbers, 
increasing 
average 
revenue 
per 
user 
 ARPU through cross-selling and cost optimization. 

 The progress on our three key initiatives is as follows: 
 
 Driving customer acquisition
 
 Our total active EPE transactional account base 
stood at approximately 1.3 million at 
the end of June 2023, 
of which 
 approximately 
1.1 million 
(or approximately 
85 are 
permanent grant 
recipients. The 
balance 
comprises Social 
 Relief of 
Distress SRD 
grant 
recipients, which 
was introduced 
during the 
COVID pandemic 
and extended 
in 
 calendar 2023. As of the end of June 
2023, we increased our permanent grant account base by 2 on 
a net basis and 
 our 
total 
grant 
base 
by 
10 
on 
a 
net 
basis, 
compared 
to 
the 
prior 
year. 
The 
net 
growth 
of 
our 
permanent 
grant 
 recipient base has 
been slower 
than anticipated as 
we continue to 
transition the business 
into a 
sales driven, customer-
 centric, financial services provider. 

Our priority 
is to grow 
our permanent 
grant recipient 
customers base, 
where we 
can build 
deeper relationships 
by 
 offering other products such as insurance and lending. We do not offer the same breadth of service to the SRD grant 
 base due to the temporary nature of the grant. 
 
 We continue to focus our efforts on designing and implementing products and services that we believe will enhance 
 the lives of these people and their families. This in turn should improve account 
activation and utilization. 
 
 Progress on cross 
selling 
 EasyPay Loans 

 o
 We originated approximately 850,000 loans in fiscal 2023 with our net consumer loan book increasing 19 to ZAR 
 415 
million 
as 
of 
June 
30, 
2023, 
compared 
to 
ZAR 
349 
million 
as 
of 
June 
30, 
2022. 
The 
loan 
conversion 
rate 
 continues to 
improve following 
the implementation 
of a 
number of 
targeted loan 
campaigns over 
the last 
quarter. 
 The portfolio loss ratio, 
calculated as the loans 
written off during the 
period as a percentage 
of the total loan book, 
 remains encouragingly low at approximately 6 per annum. 
 EasyPay Insurance 

 o
 Our insurance product sales 
continues 
to grow and 
is a material 
contributor to the 
improvement in our 
overall ARPU. 
 We 
have been 
able to improve 
customer penetration 
to approximately 
30 of our 
active permanent 
grant account 
 base as of June 30, 2023, compared to just below 20 as of June 30, 2022. Over 124,700 new policies were written 
 during fiscal 2023, compared to approximately 27,600 in the comparable period in fiscal 2022. The total number of 
 active policies has 
grown by 36 
to approximately 335,000 policies 
as of June 
30, 2023, compared to 
June 30, 2022. 
 o
 We 
have experienced 
a reduction in 
the number of 
insurance claims incurred 
following the cancellation 
of certain 
 offerings and also as a result of reduction in the number of pandemic 
-related deaths. 

29 
 ARPU 

 o
 ARPU for our 
permanent client base 
has increased 
to approximately ZAR 
80 for the 
fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2023, 
 from approximately ZAR 74 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. 

Cost optimization 
 o
 Successful execution 
of the 
cost optimization 
initiatives has 
contributed 
to our 
achievement of 
three consecutive 
 quarters of positive 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA. 
These initiatives included 
branch rationalizations, deployment 
of 
 our 
ATMs 
in 
third 
party 
merchant 
stores 
and 
reductions 
in 
our 
cash 
management 
expenditures. 
We 
continue 
to 
 evaluate 
and 
implement 
further 
optimization 
measures, 
particularly 
around 
our 
branch 
infrastructure 
and 
ATM 
 network, as we grow our Consumer Division. 

 Strengthening our relationships with key 
stakeholders 
 We continue to build our relationship with the South African Social Security Agency SASSA through proactive engagement 
 at a local, provincial, and national level. 

 We 
have 
also 
made 
good 
progress 
in 
enhancing 
our 
relationships 
with 
our 
shareholders, 
regulators, 
suppliers 
and 
other 
key 
 participants across our industry. 
 Economic Environment and Impact of loadshedding 

 The 
trading 
environment 
remains 
challenging 
in 
South 
Africa. 
High 
interest 
rates, 
inflation 
and 
unemployment 
are 
being 
 compounded by daily power 
cuts (known as load-shedding 
in South Africa). The power 
disruptions adversely impact our 
customers, 
 especially in our 
Merchant Division, where 
they lose valuable 
trading hours if 
they do not 
have access to 
alternative power supplies 
 and 
back-up 
facilities 
to 
process 
electronic 
payments 
and 
value-added 
services. 
The 
negative 
impact 
is, 
however, 
to 
some 
extent 
 mitigated as our customer base is geographically diversified, and the rotational nature of load-shedding results in 
localized power cuts 
 over shorter time periods. 
 According to data published by EskomSePush, our customers experienced significantly higher level of load-shedding during the 
 first six months of calendar 2023 of just over five hours, on average, per day, 
compared with just over two hours, on average, 
per day 
 during calendar 2022. Specifically, these power cuts intensified during 
the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2023, frequently exceeding 10 hours 
 per day. 
This deterioration 
has severely 
impacted our 
merchant s 
ability to 
make up 
lost trading 
hours and 
recharge back 
up power 
 supplies where available. 
 Notwithstanding 
the 
challenging 
operating 
environment 
our 
teams 
have 
delivered 
growth 
in 
the 
Merchant 
and 
Consumer 
 Divisions, demonstrating the resilience of our business model which is firmly underpinned by 
the relevance and value of our offering 
 to our target market. 

 Improvement in our Broad Based Black Economic 
Empowerment B-BBEE rating to level 5 
 B-BBEE is 
key 
strategic priority 
for us. 
Achievement 
of B-BBEE 
objectives 
is measured 
by a 
scorecard which 
establishes a 
 weighting 
for 
various 
elements. 
Scorecards 
are 
independently 
reviewed 
by 
accredited 
BEE 
verification 
agencies 
which 
issue 
a 
 certificate that presents 
an entity s 
BEE Contributor Status 
Level, with level 1 
being the highest and 
 no rating (a level 
below level 
 8) as the lowest. 
During fiscal 2023, we 
made significant progress in terms 
of improving our empowerment credentials 
and are pleased 
 to report 
that our 
independently 
verified 
B-BBEE rating 
has improved 
to a 
level 5 
rating from 
a level 
8 rating. 
Together 
with the 
 various other B-BBEE initiatives and programmes being 
rolled out, including our Youth 
Employment Services YES programme, 
 we aim to achieve a level 4 rating by the end of fiscal year 2024. 

 Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP 
 Under 
the 
South 
African 
Competition 
Tribunal s 
approval 
of 
the 
Connect 
acquisition, 
we 
are 
required 
to 
establish 
an 
ESOP 
 within 36 months of 
the implementation of the 
transaction that complies with certain 
design principles. This will 
benefit the workers 
 of the merged 
entity and result in 
them receiving a shareholding 
in our company equal 
in value to at 
least 3 of the 
issued shares in 
 our company as of April 14, 2022. If within 24 months of the implementation date of the transaction, we generate a positive net profit 
 for three consecutive 
quarters, the 
ESOP shall 
increase to 
5 of 
the issued 
shares in 
our company 
as of 
April 14, 
2022. We 
expect 
 that the majority 
of our South African 
workforce will be 
eligible to participate 
in the ESOP. 
We 
expect that participating 
employees 
 will be required 
to earn the 
shares awarded over 
a period of 
time, currently 
estimated at approximately 
seven years, 
but this vesting 
 period, as well as other 
terms of ESOP, 
have not been finalized 
as of the date of 
filing this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K and 
will be 
 subject to shareholder approval. 
 We 
currently 
expect to 
issue up 
to 5 
of our 
issued share 
capital to 
the ESOP 
and 
we believe 
that this 
transaction 
will be 
a 
 qualifying transaction under South Africa s Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment 
Act, and is a key strategic imperative for us 
 in achieving a target BBEE level 4 rating by 30 
June 2024. We are 
pleased to report that we progressed well on this 
initiative and are 
 confident that we will achieve this condition of the Connect acquisition within 
the time frames agreed. 

30 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our audited consolidated 
financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP, 
which requires management 
 to 
make 
estimates 
and 
assumptions 
about 
future 
events 
that 
affect 
the 
reported 
amount 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
and 
disclosure 
of 
 contingent 
assets and liabilities. As future 
events and their effects 
cannot be determined with 
absolute certainty, 
the determination of 
 estimates requires 
management s 
judgment based 
on a 
variety of 
assumptions and 
other determinants 
such as 
historical experience, 
 current 
and 
expected 
market 
conditions 
and 
certain 
scientific 
evaluation 
techniques. 
Management 
believes 
that 
the 
following 
 accounting policies 
are critical due 
to the degree 
of estimation required 
and the impact 
of these policies 
on the understandi 
ng of the 
 results of our operations and financial condition. 
 Business Combinations and the Recoverability of Goodwill 

 A significant component 
of our growth 
strategy is to acquire 
and integrate businesses 
that complement 
our existing operations. 
 The purchase 
price of 
an acquired 
business is 
allocated to 
the tangible 
and intangible 
assets acquired 
and liabilities 
assumed 
based 
 upon their estimated 
fair value at the 
date of purchase. 
The difference between 
the purchase price and 
the fair value of 
the net assets 
 acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. 
In determining 
the fair value 
of assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed 
in a business 
combination, 
 we use various 
recognized valuation methods, including 
present value modeling. 
Further, we make assumptions 
using certain valuation 
 techniques, including discount rates and timing of future cash flows. 

 We review the carrying value of goodwill annually 
or more frequently if circumstances indicating impairment have occurred. In 
 performing this review, 
we are required to estimate 
the fair value of goodwill that 
is implied from a valuation of 
the reporting unit to 
 which the goodwill 
has been allocated 
after deducting the 
fair values of 
all the identifiable 
assets and liabilities 
that form part 
of the 
 reporting 
unit. 
The determination 
of 
the fair 
value 
of a 
reporting 
unit requires 
us 
to 
make 
significant 
judgments 
and estimates. 
In 
 determining the fair value of reporting units for 
fiscal 2023 
and 2022, we considered entity-specific growth rates, future expected cash 
 flows 
to 
be 
used 
in 
our 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model, 
and 
the 
weighted-average 
cost 
of 
capital 
applicable 
to 
peer 
and 
industry 
 comparables of the reporting units. 
We base 
our estimates on assumptions 
we believe to be reasonable 
but that are unpredictable and 
 inherently uncertain. In addition, we make 
judgments and assumptions in allocating assets 
and liabilities to each of 
our reporting units. 
 The results of our impairment tests during fiscal 2023 
indicated that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded 
their carrying 
 values, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
 7.0 
million 
of 
goodwill 
impaired 
during 
fiscal 
2023, 
as 
discussed 
in 
Note 
10 
to 
our 
audited 
 consolidated financial statements. The 
results of our impairment tests 
during fiscal 2022 
indicated that the fair value 
of our reporting 
 units exceeded their carrying values and so did not require impairment. 
 Intangible Assets Acquired Through Acquisitions 
 The 
fair values 
of the 
identifiable 
intangible 
assets acquired 
through 
acquisitions 
were determined 
by management 
using 
the 
 purchase 
method 
of accounting. 
We 
completed 
the acquisition 
of 
Connect 
during 
fiscal 2022 
where 
we 
identified 
and 
recognized 
 intangible assets. We 
used the relief 
from royalty 
method to value 
identified brands 
and the multi-period 
excess earnings method 
to 
 value the 
integrated platform 
and identified 
customer relationships. 
We 
have used 
the relief 
from royalty 
method, the 
multi-period 
 excess earnings method, the income approach and the cost approach 
to value other historic acquisition-related intangible assets. In so 
 doing, 
we 
made 
assumptions 
regarding 
expected 
future 
revenues 
and 
expenses 
to 
develop 
the 
underlying 
forecasts, 
applied 
 contributory asset charges, discount rates, exchange rates, 
cash tax charges and useful lives. 

 The valuations were based on information available at the 
time of the acquisition and the expectations and 
assumptions that were 
 deemed reasonable by us. No assurance can be given, however, 
that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets 
 will occur as 
projected. For these 
reasons, among others, 
the actual cash 
flows may vary 
from forecasts of 
future cash flows. 
To 
the 
 extent actual cash flows vary, revisions to the useful life or impairment of intangible assets may be necessary. 
Management assess the 
 useful life of 
the acquired intangible 
assets upon initial 
recognition and revisions 
to the useful 
life or impairment 
of these intangible 
 assets may be necessary in the future. 
 Revenue recognition principal versus agent considerations
 We generate 
revenue from the provision of transaction-processing 
services through our various platforms 
and service offerings. 
 We 
use 
these 
platforms 
to 
(a) 
sell 
prepaid 
airtime 
and 
(b) 
distribute 
VAS, 
including 
prepaid 
airtime, 
prepaid 
electricity, 
gaming 
 voucher, and other services, to 
users of our 
platforms. The determination 
of whether we 
act as 
a principal or 
as an agent 
when providing 
 these services 
requires a 
significant amount 
of judgement 
and is based 
on whether 
(i) we 
are primarily 
responsible for 
fulfilling the 
 promise to provide the specified goods or service, (ii) we have inventory risk before the specified good 
or service has been transferred 
 to a customer 
and (iii) we 
have discretion 
in establishing 
the price 
for the specified 
good or 
service. When 
we are the 
principal in 
a 
 transaction, 
such as 
when we 
purchase (and 
thus control 
and assume 
inventory risk) 
prepaid airtime 
before selling 
it to 
customers 
 utilizing our platform, 
revenue is reported 
on a gross 
basis. When we 
are an agent 
in a transaction, 
such as when 
we distribute VAS 
 on behalf of our customers, and do not control the good or service to be provided, revenue is recognized 
based on the amount that we 
 are contractually entitled to receive for performing the distribution 
service on behalf of our customers using our platform.

 Valuation 
of investment in Cell C 
 We have elected to measure 
our investment in 
Cell C, an 
unlisted equity security, at fair 
value using the 
fair value option. 
Changes 
 in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
this 
equity 
security 
are 
recognized 
in 
the 
caption 
 change 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
equity 
securities 
in 
our 
audited 
 consolidated statements of operations. The tax impact related to the change in 
fair value of equity securities is included in income tax 
 expense in our audited 
consolidated statements of operation. 
The determination of 
the fair value of this 
equity security requires us 
to 
 make significant judgments 
and estimates. 
We base our estimates 
on assumptions we 
believe to be 
reasonable but that 
are unpredictable 
 and inherently uncertain. Refer 
to Note 6 
of our audited consolidated 
financial statements regarding the 
valuation inputs and 
sensitivity 
 related to our investment in Cell C. 
 We used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our investment in Cell C as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and 
 valued Cell C at 
 0.0 (zero) as 
of each of 
June 30, 2023 
and 2022. We 
utilized the latest approved 
business plan provided 
by Cell C 
 management for 
the period 
ended December 
31, 2025, 
for the 
June 30, 
2023 
and 2022 
valuations, and 
the following 
key valuation 
 inputs were used: 
 Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital: 
 Between 20 and 31 over the period of the forecast 
 Long-term growth rate: 
 4.5 (3 as of June 30, 2022) 
 Marketability discount: 
 20 (10 as of June 30, 2022) 
 Minority discount: 
 24 (15 as of June 30, 2022) 
 Net adjusted external debt - June 30, 2023:
 (1)
 ZAR 8.1 billion 0.4 billion), no lease liabilities included 
 Net adjusted external debt - June 30, 2022:
 (2)
 ZAR 13.5 billion 0.8 billion), no lease liabilities included 
 (1) translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable 
as of June 30, 2023. 
 (2) translated from ZAR to U.S. dollars at exchange rates applicable 
as of June 30, 2022.
 We 
believe the 
Cell C 
business plan 
is reasonable 
based on 
the current 
performance and 
the expected 
changes in 
the business 
 model. Refer to the sensitivity analysis included in 
Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements 
related to our valuation of 
 Cell C as of June 30, 2023. 
 Recoverability of equity securities and equity-accounted investments 
 We 
review our 
equity securities 
and equity-accounted 
investments for 
impairment whenever 
events or 
circumstances indicate 
 that the 
carrying amount 
of the 
investment may 
not be 
recoverable. 
In performing 
this review, 
we are 
required to 
estimate the 
fair 
 value of our 
equity-accounted investments and other 
equity securities. The 
determination of the 
fair value of 
these investments requires 
 us to make significant judgments and estimates. 

 Other equity securities include our investments in MobiKwik and CPS. These equity securities do not have readily determinable 
 fair 
values 
and 
therefore 
we 
have 
elected 
to 
measure 
these 
investments 
at 
cost 
minus 
impairment, 
if 
any, 
plus 
or 
minus 
changes 
 resulting 
from 
observable 
price 
changes 
in 
orderly 
transactions 
for 
the 
identical 
or 
a 
similar 
investment 
of 
the 
same 
issuer. 
If 
we 
 identify an impairment indicator related 
to these equity 
securities, we are required 
to assess the 
carrying value of these 
equity securities 
 against their fair 
value. We 
did not identify 
any impairment indicators 
during each 
of fiscal 2023, 
2022 
and 2021, 
and therefore did 
 not recognize any impairment losses related to these equity securities during 
those years. 
 The determination of the fair value of an investment requires us to make significant judgments and estimates. We are required to 
 base our 
estimates on 
assumptions 
which we 
believe to 
be reasonable, 
but these 
assumptions may 
be unpredictable 
and inherently 
 uncertain. 
 The Company did not 
identify any observable transactions during 
either of the 
years ended June 30, 
2023 
and 2022, and therefore 
 there was no 
change in the 
fair value of 
MobiKwik during 
the year. 
During the year 
ended June 30, 
2021, MobiKwik 
entered into a 
 number of separate 
agreements with new 
shareholders to raise 
additional capital through the 
issuance of additional 
shares. Specifically, 
 we used the 
following transactions as 
the basis for 
our fair value 
adjustments to our 
investment in MobiKwik 
during the year 
ended 
 June 30, 2021: (i) in 
early November 2020, 135.54 per 
share; (ii) in March 2021, 170.33 
per share; and (iii) in June 
2021, 245.50 
 per share. We 
considered each of these transactions to 
be an observable price change in 
an orderly transaction for similar or 
identical 
 equity securities issued by MobiKwik. Accordingly, 
the carrying value of our investment in MobiKwik increased 
from 27.0 million 
 as of June 30, 2020, to 76.3 million as of June 30, 2021. The change in the fair value 
of MobiKwik for the year ended June 30, 2021, 
 of 
 49.3 
million, 
is 
included 
in 
the 
caption 
 Change 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
equity 
securities 
in 
our 
audited 
consolidated 
statement 
of 
 operations for the year ended June 30, 2021. 
 We did 
not identify any impairment indicators 
during fiscal 2022 and therefore 
did not recognize any impairment 
losses related 
 to our 
equity-accounted investments 
during that 
year. 
We 
performed impairment 
assessments 
during fiscal 
2023 
and 2021, 
for our 
 investment in 
Finbond Group 
Limited (Finbond 
following the 
identification of 
certain impairment 
indicators. The 
results of 
our 
 impairment tests during 
fiscal 2023 
and 2021, resulted 
in impairments of 
 1.1 million and 
 21.1 million, respectively, 
related to our 
 equity-accounted investments. These impairments are discussed in 
Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

32 
 For fiscal 2023, in determining the fair value of Finbond, 
as it is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, 
its market price as 
 of the impairment assessment dates, 
adjusted for a liquidity discount 
of 25 . For fiscal 2021, 
in determining the fair value of 
certain 
 of our equity-accounted investments, we 
have considered (i) for Finbond 
specifically, its market price as of the 
impairment assessment 
 date, adjusted for a liquidity discount of 15 , 
and (ii) the net asset 
value of the equity-accounted investment being assessed as a proxy 
 of fair value because reasonable cash flow forecasts were not available. 
 We 
base our estimates on 
assumptions we believe to 
be reasonable but that 
are unpredictable and inherently 
uncertain. The fair 
 value of our investment in Finbond is sensitive to movements in its market price, which is quoted in ZAR, because we use the market 
 price as the basis of our valuation. 
 Deferred Taxation 
 We 
estimate 
our 
tax 
liability 
through 
the 
calculations 
done 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
our 
current 
tax 
liability, 
together 
with 
 assessing temporary 
differences 
resulting 
from the 
different 
treatment of 
items for 
tax and 
accounting purposes. 
These differ 
ences 
 result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are disclosed on our balance 
sheet. 

 Management then 
has to assess 
the likelihood 
that deferred tax 
assets are more 
likely than not 
to be realized 
in the foreseeable 
 future. A valuation allowance is 
created if it is determined 
that a deferred tax asset will not 
be realized in the foreseeable 
future. Any 
 change to the valuation allowance 
would be charged or 
credited to income in the period 
such determination is made. In 
assessing the 
 need for a valuation allowance, 
historical levels of income, expectations 
and risks associated with estimates of 
future taxable income 
 and ongoing prudent and 
practicable tax planning strategies 
are considered. During fiscal 2023 
and 2022, respectively we recorded 
a 
 net decrease 
of 8.0 million 
and 1.7 million, 
to our valuation 
allowance, and during 
fiscal 2021 we 
recorded a net 
increase of 1.5 
 million. As of June 30, 
2023 and 2022, the valuation 
allowance related to deferred 
tax assets was 109.1 million 
and 117.1 million, 
 respectively. 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 Management is required to make estimates and assumptions related to our valuation and recording of stock-based 
compensation 
 charges under 
current accounting 
standards. These standards 
require all share-based 
compensation to employees 
to be recognized 
in 
 the 
statement 
of 
operations 
based on 
their 
respective 
grant date 
fair 
values 
over 
the requisite 
service 
periods 
and 
also 
requires 
an 
 estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. 

 We utilize the Cox Ross 
Rubinstein binomial model to 
measure the fair 
value of stock 
options granted to 
employees and directors. 
 We 
have also utilized 
a bespoke adjusted Monte 
Carlo simulation discounted 
cash flow model to 
measure the fair value 
of restricted 
 stock with market 
conditions granted to 
employees and directors. 
The stock-based compensation 
cost related to 
these valuations has 
 been 
recognized 
on 
a 
straight-line 
basis. 
These 
valuation 
models 
require 
estimates 
of 
a 
number 
of 
key 
valuation 
inputs 
including 
 expected volatility, expected dividend yield, expected term and 
risk-free interest rate. Our 
management has estimated forfeitures based 
 on 
historic 
employee 
behavior 
under 
similar 
compensation 
plans. 
The 
fair 
value 
of 
stock 
options 
is 
affected 
by 
the 
assumptions 
 selected. The fair value calculation is especially sensitive 
to our valuation assumption with respect to expected volatility. For instance, 
 a 5 increase (to 55 or decrease (to 45 in the expected volatility used (of 50 to value stock options granted in February 2022, 
 would 
result 
in a 
charge 
that was 
9 
higher 
(if 55 
were used) 
or 9 
lower (if 
45 
were used). 
Net 
stock-based 
compensation 
 expense from continuing operations was 7.3 million, 3.0 million and 0.3 
million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

33 
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable 
 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
related to our Merchant 
and Consumer segments with respect 
to sales 
 or rental 
of hardware, 
support and 
maintenance 
services provided; 
or sale 
of licenses 
to customers; 
or the 
provision of 
transaction 
 processing services to our customers. 
 Our 
policy 
is 
to 
regularly 
review 
the 
aging 
of 
outstanding 
amounts 
due 
from 
customers 
and 
adjust 
the 
provision 
based 
on 
 management s estimate of 
the recoverability of the amounts outstanding. 
 Management 
considers 
factors including 
period outstanding, 
creditworthiness 
of the 
customers, past 
payment 
history and 
the 
 results 
of 
discussions 
by 
our 
credit 
department 
(and 
in 
some cases 
including 
our 
sales and 
finance 
teams) 
with 
the 
customer. 
We 
 consider this policy to be appropriate taking into account factors such as historical 
bad debts, current economic trends and changes in 
 our customer 
payment patterns. 
Additional provisions 
may be 
required should 
the ability 
of our 
customers to 
make payments 
when 
 due 
deteriorate 
in 
the 
future. 
Judgment 
is 
required 
to 
assess 
the 
ultimate 
recoverability 
of 
these 
receivables, 
including 
ongoing 
 evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer. 
 Lending 
 Merchant lending
 We maintain 
an allowance for doubtful finance loans 
receivable related to our Merchant services 
segment with respect to short-
 term loans 
to qualifying 
merchant 
customers. 
Our policy 
is to 
regularly 
review 
the ageing 
of outstanding 
amounts due 
from 
these 
 merchants and 
an allowance is 
created for 
the full amount 
outstanding if 
the customer is 
in arrears for 
more than 15 
days. We 
write 
 off 
loans and 
related 
interest and 
fees when 
it is 
evident 
that reasonable 
recovery 
procedures, 
including 
where 
deemed 
necessary, 
 formal legal action, have failed. 
 Our 
risk 
management 
procedures 
include 
adhering 
to 
our 
proprietary 
lending 
criteria 
which 
uses 
an 
online-system 
loan 
 application process, obtaining necessary customer transaction-history data and credit bureau checks. 
We consider these procedures to 
 be 
appropriate 
because 
it takes 
into 
account 
a 
variety 
of 
factors 
such 
as the 
customer s 
credit 
capacity 
and 
customer-specific 
risk 
 factors when originating a loan. 

 Consumer microlending 
 We maintain an allowance for doubtful finance 
loans receivable related to our Consumer services segment with respect to short-
 term loans to qualifying customers. 
Our policy is to 
regularly review the ageing 
of outstanding amounts due from 
borrowers and adjust 
 the provision based on management s 
estimate of the recoverability of finance loans receivable. We 
write off microlending loans and 
 related service fees if a borrower is in arrears with repayments for more than three months or 
dies. 
 Credit bureau checks as well as an affordability test are 
conducted as part of the origination process, both of which being in 
line 
 with local regulations. We consider this policy to be appropriate because the affordability 
test we perform takes into account a variety 
 of 
factors 
such 
as 
other 
debts 
and 
total 
expenditures 
on 
normal 
household 
and 
lifestyle 
expenses. 
Additional 
allowances 
may 
be 
 required should the ability of our customers to make payments when 
due deteriorates in the future. A significant amount of 
judgment 
 is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these 
finance loan receivables, including ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness 
 of each customer.

 Results of operations
 The discussion 
of our 
consolidated overall 
results of 
operations is 
based on 
amounts 
as reflected 
in our 
audited consolidated 
 financial statements which are prepared in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP. 
We analyze our 
results of operations both in U.S. dollars, as 
 presented in the audited consolidated financial statements, and supplementally in ZAR, because ZAR is the functional currency of the 
 entities which contribute the majority of our results and is the currency 
in which the majority of our transactions are initially incurred 
 and 
measured. 
Presentation 
of 
our 
reported 
results 
in 
ZAR 
is 
a 
non-GAAP 
measure. 
Due 
to 
the 
significant 
impact 
of 
currency 
 fluctuations between 
the U.S. dollar 
and ZAR on 
our reported 
results and 
because we 
use the 
U.S. dollar as 
our reporting 
currency, 
 we believe that 
the supplemental presentation 
of our results 
of operations in 
ZAR is useful 
to investors to 
understand the changes 
in 
 the underlying trends of our business.

 Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022 
 The following factors had 
a significant influence on 
our results of 
operations during fiscal 
2023 as compared 
with the same 
period 
 in the prior year: 
 
 Higher revenue: 
 Our revenues 
increased by 
180.0 in 
ZAR, primarily 
due to 
the contribution 
from Connect 
in Merchant 
 and an increase in account fees and insurance revenues in Consumer;
 
 Lower operating 
losses: 
 Operating 
losses decreased, 
delivering 
an improvement 
of 55 
in ZAR 
compared 
with the 
prior 
 period 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
contribution 
from 
Connect, 
strong 
hardware 
sales, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
various 
cost 
 reduction 
initiatives 
in 
Consumer, 
which 
was 
partially 
offset 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
acquisition 
related 
intangible 
asset 
 amortization; 
 
 Higher 
net 
interest 
charge:
 
The 
net 
interest 
charge 
increased 
to 
ZAR 
299.9 
million 
from 
ZAR 
56.8 
million 
due 
to 
the 
 additional borrowings 
incurred in 
order to 
fund the 
acquisition of 
Connect as 
well as 
the debt 
acquired within 
the Connect 
 business itself; 
 
 Significant transaction costs:
 
We expensed 6.0 million of transaction 
costs related to 
the Connect acquisition in 
fiscal 2022; 
 and 
 
 Foreign exchange movements:
 
The U.S. dollar was 18.0 stronger against the ZAR 
during fiscal 2023, which impacted our 
 reported results.

 Revenue increased by 305.4 million (ZAR 6.1 billion), or 137.2 (in ZAR, 180.0 ), primarily due to the inclusion of Connect 
 for 
the entire 
fiscal year, 
which has 
substantial low

in addition 
to its 
core processing 
revenue and 
an 
 increase in account fees and insurance revenues.

by 249.2 
million (ZAR

or 148.1 
(in ZAR,

which were partially offset by the benefits of 
various cost reduction initiatives in 
 Consumer and lower insurance-related claims. 

37 
 Selling, general and administration expenses increased by 20.1 million (ZAR 0.6 billion), or 26.7 (in ZAR, 49.6 ), primarily 
 due 
to 
higher

year-over-year 
impact 
of 
 inflationary 
increases 
on 
employee-related 
expenses 
and 
the 
inclusion 
of 
expenses 
related 
to 
Connect s 
operations, 
which 
were 
 partially offset by the benefits of various cost reduction initiatives in Consumer. 
 Depreciation and 
amortization expense 
increased by 16.1 
million (ZAR 0.3 
billion), or 212.7 
(in ZAR, 269.1 ), 
due to the 
 inclusion of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization related 
to intangible assets identified pursuant to 
the Connect acquisition, 
 as well as the inclusion of depreciation expense related to Connect s 
property, plant and equipment. 
 During fiscal 2023, we 
recorded an impairment loss 
of 7.0 million related 
to the impairment of 
our hardware/ software supply 
 business 
unit s 
allocated 
goodwill. 
Refer 
to 
Note 
10 
of 
our 
audited 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
for 
additional 
information 
 regarding these impairment losses. 
 We embarked on a retrenchment process on January 10, 2022, and incurred reorganization expenses of 5.9 million during fiscal 
 2022. 
 Transaction 
costs related 
to Connect 
acquisition in 
fiscal 2022 
includes fees 
paid to 
external service 
providers associated 
with 
 the contract drafting and negotiations; corporate finance advisory services; legal, financial and tax due diligence 
activities performed; 
 warranty and 
indemnity insurance 
related to the 
transaction; and other 
advisory services procured; 
as well as 
our portion 
of the fees 
 paid to competition authorities related to the regulatory filings made in 
various jurisdictions. 
 Our operating loss 
margin in fiscal 
2023 
and 2022 
was 
(2.9 and 
(18.1 ), respectively. 
 We 
 discuss the 
components of operating 
 loss margin under Results of operations by operating 
segment. 

 We 
did 
not 
record 
any 
changes 
in 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
equity 
interests 
in 
MobiKwik 
and 
Cell 
C 
during 
fiscal 
2023 
and 
2022, 
 respectively. 
We continue 
to carry our investment 
in Cell C at 0 
(zero). Refer to Note 
9 to our consolidated financial 
statements for 
 the methodology 
and inputs used 
in the fair 
value calculation for 
MobiKwik and Note 
6 for the 
methodology and 
inputs used in 
the 
 fair value calculation for Cell C. 
 Gain related to fair value adjustment to currency 
options represents the realized gain related to foreign exchange 
option contracts 
 entered into in November 2021 
in order to manage the risk of 
currency volatility and to fix 
the USD amount to be utilized 
for part of 
 the Connect purchase 
consideration settlement. The 
foreign exchange option 
contracts matured on 
February 24, 2022. 
Refer to Note 
 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
related to these currency options. 
 We 
recorded 
a 
net 
loss 
of 
 0.2 
million 
comprising 
a 
loss 
of 
 0.4 
million 
related 
to 
the 
disposal 
of 
a 
minor 
portion 
of 
our 
 investment in Finbond and a 0.25 million gain related to 
the disposal of our entire interest in Carbon 
during fiscal 2023. We recorded 
 a loss of 0.4 million related to the disposal 
of a minor portion of our investment in Finbond during fiscal 
2022. Refer to Note 9 to our 
 consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding 
these disposals. 
 We recorded 
a gain of 0.7 million related to the disposal of our entire interest 
in an equity security during fiscal 2022. Refer to 
 Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
regarding this gain. 
 Interest on surplus cash decreased to 1.9 million (ZAR 
33.2 million) from 2.1 million (ZAR 31.7 million), primarily 
due to the 
 inclusion of Connect, which was partially offset by lower overall surplus 
cash balances following the acquisition of Connect. 
 Interest expense increased 
to 18.6 million 
(ZAR 333.1 million) 
from 5.8 million 
(ZAR 88.6 million), 
primarily as a result 
of 
 additional 
interest 
expense 
incurred 
related 
to 
borrowings 
obtained 
to 
partially 
fund 
the acquisition 
of 
Connect, 
interest 
expenses 
 incurred in Connect to fund our cash management, digitization and VAS offerings, and a higher utilization of our facilities to fund our 
 ATMs, 
which was also coupled with an increase in base interest rates. 
 Fiscal 2023 
tax benefit was (2.3) million (ZAR (41.4) million) compared 
to a tax expense of 0.3 million (ZAR 5.0 million) in 
 fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was impacted by a reduction in 
the enacted South African corporate income tax rate 
 from 
28 
to 
27 
from 
January 
2023 
(but 
backdated 
to 
July 
1, 
2022),

tax 
expense 
recorded 
by 
our 
profitable 
South 
African 
 operations, a deferred 
tax benefit related to 
acquisition-related intangible asset 
amortization, non-deductible 
expenses, a deferred tax 
 benefit related 
to an 
expense paid 
by Connect 
before we 
acquired the 
business and 
which subsequently 
has been 
determined to 
be 
 deductible 
for 
tax 
purposes, 
the

 Results of Operations Use of 
Non-
 GAAP Measures . 
 Merchant 
 Segment 
revenue 
increased 
due 
to 
the 
contribution 
from 
Connect 
for 
the 
full fiscal 
year 
compared 
with 
only 
two 
and a 
half 
 months in fiscal 
2022. This increase 
was partially offset 
by lower hardware 
sales revenue given 
the lumpy nature 
of bulk sales. 
The 
 increase in 
Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA is 
also due 
to the inclusion 
of Connect, 
which was partially 
offset by 
lower hardware 
sales. 
 Connect records a significant proportion of its airtime sales in revenue and cost of sales, while only earning a relatively small margin. 
 This significantly depresses the Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins 
shown by the business. 
 Our Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA 
(loss) margin 
(calculated as 
Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA (loss) 
divided by 
revenue) in 
fiscal 
 2023 
and 2022 was 7.2 and 8.1 , respectively. 
 Consumer
 Segment revenue increased primarily due to higher insurance revenues and higher account holder fees, though this was partially 
 offset by 
lower ATM 
transaction fees. 
We 
embarked on a 
retrenchment process 
during the third 
quarter of fiscal 
2022 and recorded 
 an expense of 
 5.9 million which is 
included in Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA loss. The 
cost reduction initiatives 
we initiated in 
fiscal 
 2022 delivered 
a significant 
reduction in 
Consumer s operating 
expenses which 
resulted in 
a significantly 
lower Segment 
Adjusted 
 EBITDA 
loss 
compared 
with 
fiscal 
2022. 
Specifically, 
expenses 
associated 
with 
operating 
a 
mobile 
distribution 
network 
were 
 discontinued 
in 
early 
fiscal 
2022, 
and 
we 
have 
streamlined 
our 
fixed 
distribution 
network 
through 
reductions 
in 
certain 
expenses 
 including 
employee-related 
costs, 
security, 
guarding 
and 
premises costs. 
In 
June 
2022 
we 
recalibrated 
our 
allowance 
for 
doubtful 
 microlending finance 
loans receivable 
from 10 
of the 
lending book 
outstanding to 
6.5 of 
the lending 
book, which 
resulted in 
a 
 release from the allowance in fiscal 2022. 
 Our Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA loss 
margin in 
fiscal 2023 
and 2022 
was 5.3 and 
(32.9 ), respectively. 
After adjusting for 
 the 
reorganization 
charge 
our fiscal 
2022 
Segment 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
loss margin 
was 
(23.9 ). 
Segment 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
loss 
 margin before the reorganization charge is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that the presentation of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 loss margin 
before the 
reorganization 
charge 
is useful 
to investors 
to understand 
the improvement 
in the 
operating performance 
in 
 Consumer, before the reorganization 
charge, in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. 

 Group costs 
 Our group 
costs primarily 
include employee 
related costs 
in relation 
to employees 
specifically hired 
for group 
roles and 
costs 
 related 
directly 
to 
managing 
the 
US-listed 
entity; 
expenditures 
related 
to 
compliance 
with 
the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act 
of 
2002; 
non-
 employee directors fees; legal fees; group and US-listed related audit 
fees; and directors and officers insurance premiums. 
 Our 
group 
costs 
for 
fiscal 
2023 
increased 
compared 
with 
the 
prior 
period 
due 
to 
higher 
employee 
costs 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
 directors and officers insurance premiums. 

40 
 Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021 
 The following factors had 
a significant influence on 
our results of 
operations during fiscal 
2022 as compared with 
the same period 
 in the prior year: 
 
 Higher revenue: 
 Our revenues increased 
by 64.6 in 
ZAR, primarily due 
to the contribution 
from Connect, an 
increase in 
 hardware 
sales, 
an 
increase 
in 
merchant 
transaction 
processing 
fees, 
and 
a 
moderate 
increase 
in 
lending 
and 
insurance 
 revenues;
 
 Lower operating 
losses: 
 Operating 
losses decreased, 
delivering 
an improvement 
of 28 
in ZAR 
compared 
with the 
prior 
 period 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
positive 
contribution 
from 
Connect, 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
loss-making 
IPG 
operations 
and 
the 
 implementation of 
various cost reduction 
initiatives in our 
Consumer business, 
which was partially 
offset by 
an increase in 
 acquisition 
related 
intangible 
asset 
amortization 
and 
transaction 
costs. 
During 
fiscal 
2022, 
we 
recorded 
a 
reorganization 
 charge of 5.9 million related to the retrenchment process we 
commenced in January 2022; 
 
 Significant transaction costs:
 
We expensed 6.0 million of transaction 
costs related to 
the Connect acquisition in 
fiscal 2022; 
 and 
 
 Foreign exchange movements:
 
The U.S. dollar was 3.3 stronger 
against the ZAR during fiscal 2022, 
which impacted our 
 reported results. 
 The following tables show the changes in the items comprising our statements of 
operations, both in U.S. dollars and in ZAR:

 Revenue increased 
by 91.8 
million (ZAR 
1.3 billion), 
or 70.2 
(in ZAR, 
64.6 ), primarily 
due to 
the inclusion 
of Connect, 
 which has 
substantial low 
margin prepaid 
airtime sales 
in addition 
to its 
core processing 
revenue, an 
increase in 
hardware sales, 
an 
 increase in merchant transaction processing fees, and moderate increases in lending 
and insurance revenues. 

 Cost of goods 
sold, IT processing, 
servicing and support 
increased by 72.1 
million (ZAR 1.0 
billion), or 74.9 
(in ZAR, 69.1 ), 
 primarily due 
to the 
inclusion of 
Connect, an 
increase in 
the cost 
of hardware 
sales, higher 
costs related 
to transaction 
fees and 
an 
 increase in insurance-related claims experience, which 
were partially offset by the benefits of various cost reduction 
initiatives in our 
 Consumer business. 
 Selling, general and administration expenses decreased by 9.1 
million (ZAR 0.2 billion), or 10.8 (in ZAR, 13.7 ), primarily 
 due 
to 
lower 
IPG-related 
expenses 
incurred 
following 
its 
closure, 
some 
benefits 
from 
our 
cost 
reduction 
initiatives, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
 recalibration, in June 2022, of 
our allowance for doubtful microlending finance loans 
receivable, in our Consumer business, from 10 
 of the 
lending book 
outstanding to 
6.5 of 
the lending 
book, which 
resulted in 
a release 
from the 
allowance in 
fiscal 2022. 
These 
 reductions were partially offset by the 
inclusion of expenses related to 
Connect s operations, higher employee-related expenses related 
 to 
the 
expansion 
of 
our 
senior 
management 
team, 
and 
the 
year-over-year 
impact 
of 
inflationary 
increases 
on 
employee-related 
 expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 3.2 million (ZAR 46.8 million), or 74.3 (in ZAR, 68.5 ), 
increased due 
 to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
acquisition-related 
intangible 
asset 
amortization 
related 
to 
intangible 
assets 
identified 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Connect 
 acquisition, as well as the inclusion of depreciation expense related to 
Connect s property, 
plant and equipment. 
 We embarked on a retrenchment process on January 10, 2022, and incurred reorganization expenses of 5.9 million during 
fiscal 
 2022. 
 Transaction 
costs related 
to 
Connect 
acquisition 
includes 
fees 
paid 
to 
external

other advisory 
services procured; 
as well 
as our 
portion 
of the 
fees paid 
to 
 competition authorities related to the regulatory filings made in various jurisdictions 
. 
 Our operating loss margin 
in fiscal 2022 and 2021 
was 
(18.1 and 
(41.2 ), 
respectively. Adjusting 
for the restructuring and 
 transaction costs incurred, the underlying 
operating loss margin in fiscal 
2022 was (12.7 ). We 
discuss the components of operating 
 loss margin under Results of operations by operating 
segment. 

 The 
change 
in 
fair 
value 
of 
equity 
securities 
during 
fiscal 
2021 
represents 
a 
non-cash 
fair 
value 
adjustment 
gain 
related 
to 
 MobiKwik. We 
continue to 
carry our investment 
in Cell C 
at 0 (zero). 
Refer to Note 
9 to our 
consolidated financial 
statements for 
 the methodology 
and inputs used 
in the fair 
value calculation for 
MobiKwik and Note

methodology and 
inputs used in 
the 
 fair value calculation for Cell C.

 Gain related to fair value adjustment to currency 
options represents the realized gain related to foreign exchange 
option contracts 
 entered into in November 2021 
in order to manage the risk of 
currency volatility and to fix 
the USD amount to be utilized 
for part of 
 the Connect purchase 
consideration settlement. The 
foreign exchange 
option contracts matured 
on February 24, 
2022. Refer to 
Note 
 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
related to these currency options. 
 We recorded 
a gain of 0.7 million related to the disposal of our 
entire interest in an equity security during fiscal 2022. 
Refer to 
 Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
regarding this gain. 
 We 
recorded a 
loss of 0.4 
million related 
to the 
disposal of 
a minor 
portion of 
our investment 
in Finbond 
during fiscal 
2022. 
 Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
regarding these disposals. 
 We recorded 
a loss of 0.5 million related to the disposal of Bank Frick during fiscal 2021. 
 Interest on surplus cash decreased to 2.1 million (ZAR 
31.7 million) from 2.4 million (ZAR 38.0 million), 
primarily due to the 
 utilization of a significant portion 
of our surplus cash 
reserves to acquire Connect as 
well as lower average daily 
cash balances in fiscal 
 2022. 
 Interest 
expense increased 
to 5.8 
million (ZAR 
88.6) million 
from 3.0 
million (ZAR 
46.9 million), 
primarily 
as a 
result of 
 additional 
interest 
expense 
incurred 
related 
to 
borrowings 
obtained 
to 
partially 
fund 
the acquisition 
of 
Connect, 
interest 
expenses 
 incurred in Connect to fund our cash management, digitization and VAS offerings, and a higher utilization of our facilities to fund our 
 ATMs 
. 
 Fiscal 2022 tax expense 
was 0.3 million (ZAR 
5.0 million) compared 
to 7.6 million (ZAR 
118.8 million) 
in fiscal 2021. Our 
 effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was impacted 
by the tax expense recorded by our profitable South 
African operations, a deferred tax 
 benefit related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, non-deductible expenses (including transaction expenses related to 
 the 
acquisition 
of 
Connect), 
the 
on-going 
losses 
incurred 
by 
certain 
of 
our 
South 
African 
businesses 
and 
the 
associated 
valuation 
 allowances created related to the deferred tax assets recognized regarding 
net operating losses incurred by these entities. 
 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 
impacted by the tax effect on the 
change in the fair value 
of our equity securities, which 
 is at 
a lower 
tax rate 
than 
the South 
African 
statutory 
rate, the 
tax charge 
related 
to our 
profitable 
South 
African operations, 
non-
 deductible expenses, the on-going losses incurred by certain of our 
South African businesses and the associated valuation allowances 
 created related to the deferred 
tax assets recognized regarding net 
operating losses incurred by these 
entities, which was partially offset 
 by the reversal of the deferred tax liability related to one of our equity-accounted 
investments following its impairment. 
 The disposal of certain of our equity-accounted investments in 
fiscal 2021, as well as a number of impairments, 
has impacted the 
 comparability of our 
loss from 
equity-accounted investments. We disposed of 
our investment 
in Bank Frick 
in fiscal 
2021. 
 We 
 recorded 
 an impairment loss related to our investment in Finbond in fiscal 2021 
following a slow-down in its business activity and lower listed 
 share price. 
Refer to Note 9 
to our audited consolidated financial statements 
for additional information regarding our equity-accounted 
 investments, including disclosure regarding the disposals and impairments.

 Results of Operations Use of

 Merchant 
 Segment revenue 
increased due 
to the 
inclusion of 
Connect for 
two and 
a half 
months and 
an increase 
in hardware 
sales and 
 processing fees. The 
increase in Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA is 
primarily due to 
the inclusion of 
Connect, which was 
partially offset 
 by higher costs related 
to processing fees 
and higher employee-related expenses. Connect 
records a significant proportion 
of its airtime 
 sales in revenue 
and cost of 
sales, while only 
earning a relatively 
small margin. This depresses 
the Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
margins 
 shown by the business. 

44 
 Our Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal 2022 
and 2021 
was 8.1 and 8.6 , respectively. 
 Consumer
 The underlying decrease in revenue was primarily due to 
lower processing fees, partially offset by higher insurance 
and lending 
 revenue 
and account 
holder fees. 
We 
embarked 
on a 
retrenchment process 
during 
the third 
quarter of 
fiscal 2022 
and recorded 
an 
 expense 
of 
 5.9 
million 
which 
is 
included 
in 
the 
Segment 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
loss, 
refer 
to 
Note 
1 
to 
our 
consolidated 
financial 
 statements for 
additional information 
regarding this 
process. 
Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA loss, 
excluding the 
reorganization charge, 
 has 
decreased 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
various 
cost 
reduction 
initiatives 
and 
a 
recalibration, 
in 
June 
2022, 
of 
our 
 allowance for doubtful microlending finance loans receivable from 10 of the lending book outstanding to 6.5 of the lending book, 
 which resulted in a release from the allowance in 
fiscal 2022, which decreases were partially offset by an increase in 
insurance-related 
 claims experience. 
 Our Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
loss margin for fiscal 
2022 
and 2021 was 
(32.9 and 
(39.2 ), respectively. 
After adjusting 
 for the reorganization 
charge our fiscal 2022 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA loss 
margin was (23.9 
. 
We 
believe that the presentation 
 of our Segment Adjusted EBITDA loss margin before 
the reorganization charge is useful to investors to understand 
the improvement 
 in the operating performance in Consumer, before 
the reorganization charge, in fiscal 2022 
compared with fiscal 2021. 
 Group costs 
 Our group costs increased primarily due to higher employee 
costs, an increase in audit fees and directors 
and officers 
insurance 
 premiums. 
 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 U.S. securities laws 
require that when 
we publish any 
non-GAAP measures, we 
disclose the reason 
for using these 
non-GAAP 
 measures and provide reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The presentation of Group Adjusted EBITDA 
 is 
a 
non-GAAP 
measure. 
We 
provide 
this 
non-GAAP 
measure 
to 
enhance 
our 
evaluation 
and 
understanding 
of 
our 
financial 
 performance. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Group

EBITDA

fair value adjustments to currency 
 options), (earnings) loss from

 Once-off items are non-recurring in nature, however, certain 
items may be reported in 
multiple quarters. For instance, transaction 
 costs include costs incurred related to acquisitions and 
transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. The transactions can span 
 multiple quarters, for instance in fiscal 2022 we 
incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition Connect over 
a number 
 of quarters, and the transactions are generally non-recurring. 
 Non-recurring revenue not 
allocated to segments 
includes once off 
revenue recognized that 
we believe does 
not relate to 
either 
 our Merchant 
or Consumer 
divisions. Employee 
misappropriation of 
company funds 
represents a 
once-off 
loss incurred. 
Expenses 
 incurred 
related 
to 
close 
of 
legacy 
businesses 
represents 
costs 
incurred 
related 
to 
subsidiaries 
which 
we 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
 deregistering/ liquidation 
and therefore we 
consider these costs non-operational 
and ad hoc in 
nature. Indirect tax 
provision includes 
 non-recurring indirect taxes 
which have been 
provided related to 
prior periods following 
an on-going 
investigation from a 
tax authority. 
 We 
incurred separation 
costs related 
to the 
termination of 
certain senior-level 
employees, including 
an executive 
officer and 
senior 
 managers, during 
the fiscal 
year and 
we consider 
these specific 
terminations to 
be of 
a non-recurring 
nature. The 
legacy processing 
 adjustments represents amounts we 
identified during fiscal 2022 
related to prior 
periods that are 
payable to third 
parties. 
The allowance 
 for doubtful 
EMI loans 
receivable relates 
to provision 
created in 
fiscal 2021 
related to 
loan provided 
to certain 
of our 
then equity-
 accounted investments.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 At June 30, 
2023, our unrestricted 
cash and cash 
equivalents were 35.5 
million and comprised 
of ZAR-denominated 
balances 
 of ZAR 
0.6 million 29.2 
million), U.S. dollar-denominated 
balances of 4.5 
million, and other 
currency deposits, primarily 
Botswana 
 pula, of 
 1.8 million, 
all amounts translated 
at exchange 
rates applicable 
as of 
June 30, 
2023. The 
decrease in 
our unrestricted 
cash 
 balances 
from 
June 
30, 
2022, 
was 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
utilization 
of 
cash 
reserves 
to 
fund 
certain 
scheduled 
repayments 
of 
our 
 borrowings, fully settle our revolving credit facility, purchase ATMs 
and safe assets, and to make an investment in working capital in 
 our 
Consumer 
and 
Merchant 
operation, 
which 
was 
partially 
offset 
by 
the 
utilization 
of 
our 
available 
borrowings 
and 
a 
positive 
 contribution from Connect and certain of our Consumer operations. 
 We generally 
invest any surplus cash held by our 
South African operations in overnight 
call accounts that we maintain at 
South 
 African banking institutions, 
and any surplus 
cash held by 
our non-South African 
companies in 
U.S. dollar-denominated money market 
 accounts. 

 Historically, 
we have financed 
most of our 
operations, research and 
development, working capital, 
and capital expenditures, 
as 
 well 
as 
acquisitions 
and 
strategic 
investments, 
through 
internally 
generated 
cash 
and 
our 
financing 
facilities. 
When 
considering 
 whether to borrow under our financing 
facilities, we consider the cost 
of capital, cost of financing, opportunity cost 
of utilizing surplus 
 cash and 
availability of 
tax efficient 
structures to 
moderate financing 
costs. For 
instance, in 
fiscal 2022, 
we obtained 
loan facilities 
 from RMB 
to fund 
a portion 
of our 
acquisition of 
Connect. 
Following the 
acquisition of 
Connect, we 
now utilize 
a combination 
of 
 short 
and 
long-term 
facilities to 
fund our 
operating 
activities and 
a long-term 
asset-backed 
facility to 
fund 
the acquisition 
of POS 
 devices and 
safe assets. 
Refer to

12. These borrowings 
include outstanding 
long-term borrowings 
obtained by Lesaka 
SA of ZAR 
0.9 
 billion, 
including 
accrued 
interest, 
which 
was 
used 
to 
partially 
fund 
the 
acquisition 
of 
Connect. 
The 
Lesaka 
SA 
borrowing 
 arrangements were amended 
in March 2023 
to include a 
ZAR 200 million 
revolving credit facility. 
The revolving credit 
facility had 
 been repaid in full as of June 30, 2023, and the entire balance is available for utilization. In contemplation of the Connect transaction, 
 Connect obtained 
total facilities 
of approximately 
ZAR 1.3 
billion, which 
were utilized 
to repay 
its existing 
borrowings, 
to fund 
a 
 portion of its capital expenditures and to settle obligations under the transaction documents, and which has subsequently been upsized 
 for its 
operational requirements 
and has 
an outstanding 
balance as 
of June 
30, 2023, 
of ZAR 
1.2 billion, 
We 
also have 
a revolving 
 credit facility, of ZAR 300.0 million 
which is utilized to fund a portion of our merchant finance loans receivable book. 
 Restricted cash 
 We 
have credit 
facilities with RMB 
in order 
to access cash 
to fund 
our ATMs 
in South Africa. 
Our cash, cash 
equivalents and 
 restricted cash 
presented in 
our consolidated 
statement of 
cash flows 
as of 
June 30, 
2023, includes 
restricted cash 
of approximately 
 23.0 
million 
related 
to 
cash withdrawn 
from 
our 
debt 
facility 
to 
fund 
ATMs. 
This 
cash 
may 
only 
be 
used 
to 
fund 
ATMs 
and 
is 
 considered restricted as to use and therefore is classified as restricted cash on 
our consolidated balance sheet. 
 We 
have also 
entered into 
cession and 
pledge agreements 
with Nedbank 
related to 
our Nedbank 
credit facilities 
and we 
have 
 ceded and 
pledged certain 
bank accounts 
to Nedbank. 
The funds 
included in 
these bank 
accounts are 
restricted as 
they may 
not be 
 withdrawn without 
the express permission 
of Nedbank. Our 
cash, cash equivalents 
and restricted cash 
presented in our 
consolidated 
 statement of cash flows as of June 30, 2023, includes restricted cash of approximately 
 0.2 million that has been ceded and pledged. 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided 
by operating activities 
during fiscal 
2023 
was 0.4 million 
(ZAR 7.4 million) 
compared to 
net cash utilized 
 by 
operating 
activities 
of 
 37.2 
million 
(ZAR 
565.3 
million) 
during 
fiscal 
2022. 
Excluding 
the 
impact 
of 
income 
taxes, 
our 
cash 
 provided by operating activities 
during fiscal 2023 
was impacted by 
the positive contribution from 
Connect and certain 
business within 
 our consumer 
business, which was 
partially offset 
by growth 
in our consumer 
and merchant finance 
loans receivable 
books. During 
 fiscal 2023, we 
observed fluctuations in 
our working capital, primarily 
within our merchant business, 
as a result of 
monthly changes 
 in our inventory and prepayment 
account balances as a result of 
payments made to secure prepaid 
airtime inventory. 
Certain of these 
 purchases were funded from our borrowing arrangements and the 
impact of the funding is included in financing activities. 
 Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2022 was 37.2 million (ZAR 565.3 million) compared to 58.4 million (ZAR 
 887.1 million) generated during fiscal 
2021. Excluding the impact of income 
taxes, our cash used in operating activities during 
fiscal 
 2022 was impacted by 
the cash losses incurred by 
the majority of our 
continuing operations, the reorganization 
costs paid during the 
 third quarter of 
fiscal 2022, and 
transactions costs paid 
related to our 
acquisition of Connect. 
In fiscal 2022, 
we absorbed 5 
million 
 into working capital compared to a 4.7 million release from working capital 
in fiscal 2021. 
 During fiscal 2023, 
we paid our 
first provisional South 
African tax payments 
of 3.0 million 
(ZAR 50.8 million) 
related to our 
 2023 
tax year. During fiscal 2023, we 
also made our second 
provisional South African tax 
payments 
of 4.1 million (ZAR 
76.1 million 
 related to our 2023 tax 
year and received tax refunds 
of 0.2 million (ZAR (3.8) 
million). We 
also paid taxes totaling 0.4 
million in 
 other tax jurisdictions, primarily in the Botswana. 
 During fiscal 2022, 
we made our 
first provisional South 
African tax payments 
of 0.6 million 
(ZAR 9.1 million) 
related to our 
 2022 
tax year. During fiscal 2022, we 
also made our second 
provisional South African tax 
payments 
of 0.7 million (ZAR 
10.9 million 
 related to our 2022 tax year and made an additional tax payment of 0.0 million (ZAR 
0.0 million) related to our 2021 tax year. 

 During fiscal 2021, we made our first provisional South 
African tax payments 
of 0.8 million (ZAR 11.9 million) 
related to our 
 2021 
tax year. During fiscal 2021, we also 
made our second provisional South African 
tax payments 
of 0.5 million (ZAR 8.0 
million) 
 related to our 2021 tax year and made an additional 
tax payment of 0.8 million (ZAR 11.6 
million) related to our 2020 tax year. 
We 
 also paid taxes totaling 4.3 million in other tax jurisdictions, primarily in the U.S.

 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Cash used 
in investing 
activities for 
fiscal 2023 
included capital 
expenditures of 
 16.2 million 
(ZAR 289.8 
million), primarily 
 due to the 
acquisition of ATMs 
. 
During fiscal 2023, 
we received proceeds 
of 0.25 million 
related to the 
first tranche (of 
two) from 
 the disposal of our entire equity interest in Carbon and 0.4 million related to 
the sale of minor positions in Finbond. 
 During fiscal 
2022, we 
paid approximately 
 4.6 million 
(ZAR 69.3 
million), primarily 
due to 
the roll 
out of 
our new 
express 
 branches, acquisitions of ATMs and the acquisition of 
computer equipment. During fiscal 
2022, we paid approximately 
 202.2 million 
 (ZAR 2.9 billion), net of cash acquired, for 100 of Connect. We 
also received funds totaling approximately 11.4 
million related to 
 the sale of Bank 
Frick in fiscal 
2021, proceeds from sale of 
property, plant and equipment of 4.2 million, 
and proceeds of 0.9 
million 
 and 0.7 million, respectively, related to the sale of minor positions in Finbond and from the disposal of our entire interest in Revix in 
 fiscal 2022. 
 During 
fiscal 
2021, 
we paid 
approximately 
 4.3 million 
(ZAR 65.1 
million), 
primarily 
for 
the acquisition 
of motor 
vehicles, 
 which largely comprised a fleet of customized mobile ATMs 
used to deliver a service to rural communities, computer equipment 
and 
 leasehold improvements in South 
Africa. In February 2021, we disposed 
of our investment in Bank 
Frick and received 18.6 million 
 of the 30.0 million 
sales proceeds, the remainder 
of which was expected 
to be received in 
fiscal 2022 and 2023. 
We 
received 20.1 
 million in September 2020 related to the sale of our South Korean 
business in fiscal 2020 following the successful refund application 
 of 
the 
amounts 
withheld 
and 
paid 
to 
the 
South 
Korean 
tax 
authorities 
pursuant 
to 
that 
transaction. 
We 
received 
 6.0 
due 
on 
the 
 remaining deferred sale proceeds related to the fiscal 2020 sale of DNI. We also extended loan funding of 1.0 million to V2 and 0.2 
 million to Revix. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 During fiscal 2023, we utilized approximately 520.1 
million from our South African overdraft facilities to fund 
our ATMs 
and 
 our cash management business through Connect and repaid 
 547.3 million of these facilities. We utilized approximately 24.4 million 
 of our long-term 
borrowings to settle approximately 
 10.5 million of our 
revolving credit facilities, 
fund our merchant 
finance loans 
 receivable business, and to fund the acquisition of certain capital expenditures 
. 
We repaid approximately 
 17.5 million of these long-
 term, including approximately 10.5 million to settle our 
revolving credit balance in full. We 
received 0.5 million from the exercise 
 of stock options. We also paid 1.3 million to repurchase shares from employees in order for the employees to settle taxes due related 
 to the vesting of shares of restricted stock and to settle the strike price due and taxes 
due related to the exercise of stock options. 
 During fiscal 2022, we utilized approximately 570.9 million 
from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs 
and 
 our cash management business through Connect and 
repaid 525.5 million of these facilities. 
We utilized approximately 78.9 million 
 of our long-term borrowings 
to fund a portion 
of the acquisition of Connect, 
to fund our merchant 
finance loans receivable business, 
 and to fund the acquisition 
of certain capital expenditures. We 
repaid approximately 5.6 million 
of these long-term borrowings. 
We 
 also received 0.8 million from the exercise of stock options. 
 During fiscal 2021, we utilized approximately 360.1 million 
from our South African overdraft facilities to fund our ATMs 
and 
 repaid 365.4 million of these facilities.

 Our capital expenditures 
for fiscal 2023, 
2022 and 2021, are 
discussed under Liquidity 
and Capital Resources Cash 
flows 
 from investing activities. 
 All of our capital expenditures 
for the past three fiscal 
years were funded through 
internally-generated funds, except 
for certain 
 capital 
expenditures 
of 
POS devices 
and 
safe 
assets, made 
by 
Connect 
which 
were funded 
through 
the utilization 
of asset-backed 
 borrowings. 
We 
had 
outstanding 
capital commitments 
as of 
June 30, 
2023, 
of 0.1 
million. 
We 
expect 
to fund 
these expenditures 
 through 
internally-generated 
funds. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
capital 
expenditures, 
we 
expect 
that 
capital 
spending 
for 
fiscal 
2024 
will 
 include acquisition 
of POS devices, 
safe assets, vehicles, 
computer and office 
equipment, as well 
as for our 
ATM 
infrastructure and 
 branch 
network 
in 
South 
Africa. 
These 
assets 
will 
be 
funded 
through 
the 
use 
of 
internally-generated 
funds 
and 
our 
asset-backed 
 borrowing arrangement.

 ITEM 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 We seek to manage our exposure to currency exchange, translation, interest rate, credit, microlending credit and equity price and 
 liquidity risks as discussed below. 
 Currency Exchange Risk 
 We 
are subject 
to currency 
exchange risk 
because we 
purchase components 
for safe 
assets, that 
we assemble, 
and inventories 
 that we 
are required 
to settle 
in other 
currencies, primarily 
the euro, 
renminbi, and 
U.S. dollar. 
We 
have used 
forward contracts 
in 
 order to limit our exposure in these transactions to 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the South African rand ZAR ), on the one 
 hand, and the U.S. dollar and the euro, on the other hand. 

 We 
 had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of June 30, 
2023 and 2022. 
 Translation Risk 
 Translation risk relates to the risk that our 
results of operations will vary significantly as 
the U.S. dollar is our 
reporting currency, 
 but we earn a significant amount of our revenues and 
incur a significant amount of our expenses in ZAR. The U.S. dollar 
to the ZAR 
 exchange rate has 
fluctuated significantly over 
the past three 
years. As exchange rates 
are outside our 
control, there can 
be no assurance 
 that future fluctuations will not adversely affect our results 
of operations and financial condition. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As a result 
of our normal borrowing 
activities, our operating results 
are exposed to fluctuations 
in interest rates, 
which we manage 
 primarily through regular 
financing activities. Interest 
rates in South 
Africa are trending upwards 
and we expect higher 
interest rates 
 in the foreseeable future which will increase our cost of 
borrowing. We periodically evaluate the cost and effectiveness of interest rate 
 hedging strategies 
to manage this 
risk. We 
generally maintain 
investments in 
cash equivalents and 
held to maturity 
investments and 
 have occasionally invested in marketable securities. 
 We have 
short and long-term borrowings in South 
Africa as described in Note 12 
to our consolidated financial statements which 
 attract interest 
at rates 
that fluctuate 
based on 
changes in 
the South 
African prime 
and 3-month 
JIBAR interest 
rates. The 
following 
 table illustrates the effect on 
our annual expected interest charge, 
translated at exchange rates 
applicable as of June 30, 
2023, as a result 
 of changes in the South African prime and 3-month JIBAR interest 
rates, using our outstanding short and long-term borrowings 
as of 
 June 30, 2023. The effect of a hypothetical 1 (i.e. 100 basis points) increase and a 1 decrease in the interest rates applicable to the 
 borrowings as of June 30, 
2023, are shown. The 
selected 1 hypothetical change does 
not reflect what could be considered 
the best- 
 or worst-case scenarios.

 Credit Risk 

 Credit risk 
relates to 
the risk of 
loss that we 
would incur 
as a 
result of non-performance 
by counterparties. 
 We 
 maintain credit 
 risk 
policies 
in 
respect 
of 
our 
counterparties 
to 
minimize 
overall 
credit 
risk. 
These 
policies 
include 
an 
evaluation 
of 
a 
potential 
 counterparty s 
financial 
condition, 
credit 
rating, 
and 
other 
credit 
criteria 
and 
risk 
mitigation 
tools 
as 
our 
management 
deems 
 appropriate. 
With 
respect to 
credit risk 
on financial 
instruments, 
we maintain 
a policy 
of entering 
into such 
transactions only 
with 
 South African and European financial institutions that have a credit rating 
of B (or its equivalent) or better, as determined 
by credit 
 rating agencies such as Standard Poor s, Moody s 
and Fitch Ratings. 

51 
 Consumer microlending credit risk 
 We are exposed 
to credit risk in our Consumer microlending activities, which provides unsecured short-term loans 
to qualifying 
 customers. Credit bureau checks as well as an affordability test are conducted as part of the origination process, both of 
which are line 
 with local regulations. 
 We 
 consider this policy to be appropriate because the affordability test we perform takes into account a variety 
 of 
factors 
such 
as 
other 
debts 
and 
total 
expenditures 
on 
normal 
household 
and 
lifestyle 
expenses. 
Additional 
allowances 
may 
be 
 required should the 
ability of our customers 
to make payments when 
due deteriorate in 
the future. A significant 
amount of judgment 
 is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these 
finance loan receivables, including ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness 
 of each customer. 
 Merchant lending 
 We 
 maintain an allowance 
for doubtful finance 
loans receivable related 
to its Merchant 
services segment with 
respect to short-
 term loans 
to qualifying 
merchant customers. 
Our risk 
management procedures 
include adhering 
to our 
proprietary lending 
criteria 
 which uses an online-system loan 
application process, obtaining necessary customer transaction-history data and 
credit bureau checks. 
 We 
 consider these procedures to be appropriate because it 
takes into account a variety of 
factors such as the customer s credit capacity 
 and customer-specific risk factors when originating a loan. 
 Equity Securities Price Risk 
 Equity price risk relates to the risk 
of loss that we would incur as 
a result of the volatility in the exchange 
-traded price of equity 
 securities that we hold. As of June 30, 2023, we did not have any equity securities that 
were exchange-traded and held as available for 
 sale. Historically, exchange 
-traded equity securities held as available for sale were expected to be held for an extended period of time 
 and we were 
not concerned with 
short-term equity price volatility 
with respect to 
these securities provided that 
the underlying business, 
 economic and management characteristics of the company remained 
sound. 

 The market price of these exchange-traded equity securities may fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
and, consequently, the amount 
 we may obtain in a subsequent sale of these securities may significantly differ 
from the reported market value. 
 Equity Securities Liquidity Risk
 Equity liquidity risk 
relates to the 
risk of loss 
that we would 
incur as a 
result of the 
lack of liquidity 
on the exchange 
on which 
 those securities are 
listed. 
 We 
 may not 
be able to 
sell some or 
all of these 
securities at one 
time, or over 
an extended period 
of time 
 without influencing the exchange-traded price, or at all. 
 We monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed 
 to be other-than-temporary. 
 We hold approximately 27.8 of the issued share capital 
of Finbond which are exchange-traded equity 
securities, however, from 
 April 1, 2016, 
we have accounted 
for them using 
the equity method. 
The fair value 
of these securities 
of 4.6 million 
as of June 
30, 
 2023, 
represented approximately 0.8 of our total assets, including these securities.

 Under the supervision and 
with the participation of 
our management, including our 
Group Chief Executive Officer and 
our Group 
 Chief Financial 
Officer, 
we conducted 
an evaluation 
of our 
disclosure controls 
and procedures, 
as such 
term is 
defined under 
Rule 
 13a-15(e) under the 
Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, as amended 
(the Exchange Act ). 
Based on this evaluation, 
our Group Chief 
 Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer 
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective as of June 
 30, 2023.
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, 
our Group Chief Executive Officer 
 and Group Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing 
similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management, and 
 other 
personnel, 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
 statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, 
 in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
our assets; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that 
 transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of 
financial statements in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP, 
and that receipts 
 and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our officers and directors; and (3) provide 
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized 
acquisition, use or disposition 
of our assets that could 
 have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Inherent Limitations in Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving 
financial reporting objectives because of 
 its inherent 
limitations. 
Internal 
control 
over 
financial reporting 
is a 
process that 
involves 
human 
diligence 
and 
compliance 
and 
is 
 subject 
to 
lapses 
in 
judgment and 
breakdowns 
resulting 
from human 
failures. 
Internal 
control over 
financial 
reporting 
also 
can 
be 
 circumvented by collusion or improper 
management override. Because of such 
limitations, there is a risk that 
material misstatements 
 may not 
be prevented 
or detected 
on a 
timely basis 
by internal 
control over 
financial reporting. 
However, 
these inherent 
limitations 
 are known features of the financial reporting 
process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards 
to reduce, though 
 not eliminate, this risk. 
 Management s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management, including our Group Chief 
Executive Officer and our Group 
Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for 
establishing 
 and maintaining 
adequate internal control 
over our financial 
reporting. Management 
conducted an evaluation 
of the effectiveness 
of 
 internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued 
by the 
 Committee 
of Sponsoring 
Organizations 
of the 
Treadway 
Commission 
(COSO). Based 
on this 
evaluation, management 
concluded 
 that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
June 30, 2023. Deloitte Touche (South Africa), our independent 
 registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, 
 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the shareholders 
and the Board of Directors of Lesaka Technologies, 
Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited 
the internal control over financial reporting of Lesaka Technologies, 
Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as 
 of 
June 
30, 
2023, 
based 
on 
criteria 
established 
in 
 Internal 
Control 
 
Integrated 
Framework 
(2013)
 
issued 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
 Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). 
In our 
opinion, the 
Company maintained, 
in all material 
respects, 
 effective internal 
control over financial 
reporting as of 
June 30, 2023, 
based on criteria 
established in 
 Internal Control 
 Integrated 
 Framework (2013)
 
issued by COSO. 

 We 
have 
also audited, 
in accordance 
with the 
standards of 
the Public 
Company Accounting 
Oversight Board 
(United States) 
 (PCAOB), the 
consolidated 
financial statements 
as of 
and for 
the year 
ended June 
30, 2023, 
of the 
Company and 
our report 
dated 
 September 12, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial 
statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The 
Company s 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
and 
for 
its 
 assessment of 
the effectiveness 
of internal 
control over 
financial reporting, 
included in 
the accompanying 
Management s 
Report on 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our 
responsibility is to express 
an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial 
 reporting based 
on our 
audit. We 
are a 
public accounting 
firm registered 
with the 
PCAOB and 
are required 
to be 
independent with 
 respect to the 
Company in accordance 
with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and 
the applicable rules 
and regulations of 
the Securities 
 and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted 
our audit in accordance with 
the standards of the PCAOB. Those 
standards require that we plan 
and perform the 
 audit to 
obtain reasonable 
assurance about 
whether effective 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting was 
maintained in 
all material 
 respects. Our audit 
included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over 
financial reporting, assessing 
the risk that a 
material 
 weakness 
exists, 
testing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
based 
on 
the 
assessed 
risk, 
and 
 performing such 
other procedures as 
we considered necessary 
in the circumstances. 
We 
believe that our 
audit provides a 
reasonable 
 basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A 
company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
 reliability of financial 
reporting and the 
preparation of financial 
statements for external 
purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted 
 accounting principles. A company s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
 the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
 company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
 accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the 
company are being made only 
in 
 accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
company; 
and 
(3) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition 
of the company s assets that could have 
a material effect 
 on the financial statements. 
 Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
misstatements. 
Also, 
 projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of 
 changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the shareholders 
and the Board of Directors of Lesaka Technologies, 
Inc.
 Opinion on the Financial Statements
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lesaka Technologies, 
Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company 
 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive 
(loss) income, changes in equity, 
and 
 cash flows, for each 
of the three years 
in the period ended June 
30, 2023, and the 
related notes (collectively referred to as 
the financial 
 statements ). In our opinion, 
the financial statements present 
fairly, in 
all material respects, the 
financial position of the 
Company as 
 of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations 
and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended June 30, 
 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America.
 We 
have 
also audited, 
in accordance 
with the 
standards of 
the Public 
Company Accounting 
Oversight Board 
(United States) 
 (PCAOB), the Company's 
internal control over financial 
reporting as of 
June 30, 2023, 
based on criteria established 
in 
 Internal Control 
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission and our report 
 dated September 12, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion 
on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
 Basis for Opinion
 These financial statements 
are the responsibility 
of the Company's 
management. Our 
responsibility is to express 
an opinion on 
 the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required 
 to 
be 
independent 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Company 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws 
and 
the 
applicable 
rules 
and 
 regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the 
 audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or 
 fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due 
 to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. 
Such procedures included examining, on a 
test basis, evidence 
 regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. 
Our audits also included evaluating 
the accounting principles used 
 and significant estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. We 
believe 
 that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 Critical Audit Matters
 The critical audit matters communicated 
below are matters arising from 
the current-period audit of the financial 
statements that 
 were communicated 
or required 
to be 
communicated 
to the 
audit committee 
and that 
(1) relates 
to accounts 
or disclosures 
that are 
 material to the 
financial statements and 
(2) involved our 
especially challenging, subjective, or 
complex judgments. The 
communication 
 of 
critical 
audit 
matters 
does 
not 
alter 
in 
any 
way 
our 
opinion 
on 
the 
financial 
statements, 
taken 
as 
a 
whole, 
and 
we 
are 
not, 
by 
 communicating 
the 
critical 
audit 
matters 
below, 
providing 
a 
separate 
opinion 
on 
the 
critical 
audit 
matters 
or 
on 
the 
accounts 
or 
 disclosures to which they relate.
 Goodwill Potential impairment of reporting units
 Refer to Note 10 to the financial statements
 Critical Audit Matter Description
 Goodwill 
represents 
the 
cost 
in 
excess 
of 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
identifiable 
net 
assets 
from 
the 
businesses 
that 
the 
Company 
 acquired. 
The Company's 
evaluation 
of goodwill 
for 
impairment 
involves 
the 
comparison 
of 
the fair 
value 
of 
reporting 
unit 
to 
its 
 carrying value. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the 
fair value for each reporting unit, which requires the 
 Company to make significant estimates 
and assumptions related to forecasts of 
future cash flows. In 
addition, the discounted cash flow 
 model requires the Company to select an appropriate weighted average cost of capital based on current market conditions. Changes in 
 these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the 
amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was 
Addressed in the Audit
 Our principal audit procedures related to the assessment of forecasts of cash flows and the computation of the weighted average 
 cost of capital used by the Company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
included the following, among others:
 
 Tested the effectiveness of controls over the 
Company's goodwill impairment evaluation. This 
included controls to the 
review 
 of the Company's forecasts of future cash flows and controls over the computation 
of the weighted average cost of capital. 
 
 Verified 
the mathematical accuracy of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) calculations used by 
the Company. 

F-3 
 
 Evaluated the Company's ability to accurately forecast cash flows by:
 
 Performing sensitivity 
analyses of 
certain significant 
assumptions to 
evaluate the 
changes in 
the fair 
value of 
the 
 reporting units that would result from changes in these assumptions;
 
 Determining 
the reasonableness 
of the 
revenue 
growth rates 
against historic 
performance, 
approved 
budgets, and 
 expected future performance based on industry and entity-specific factors; 
and
 
 Assessing forecast revenue to approved forecasts.
 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated 
the weighted average cost of capital used by the Company by:
 
 Testing the mathematical 
accuracy of the Company's calculation of the weighted average cost of capital; and
 
 Developing a range of independent estimates of weighted average cost of capital per reporting unit and comparing this range 
 to the weighted average cost of capital selected by the Company.
 Valuation 
of One MobiKwik Systems Limited (Mobikwik) impairment 
considerations
 Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements
 Critical Audit Matter Description
 The investment in Mobikwik 
is measured at cost minus 
impairment, plus or minus 
adjustments resulting from observable 
price 
 changes in orderly transactions 
for the identical or 
a similar investment of the 
same issuer minus impairment, 
if any. 
The subsequent 
 measurement section of 
FASB ASC 
Topic 
321: Investments Equity 
Securities requires that because 
the Investment in MobiKwik 
 represents 
an 
equity 
security 
without 
a 
readily 
determinable 
fair 
value, 
it 
should 
be 
written 
down 
to 
its 
fair 
value 
if 
a 
qualitative 
 assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, and the fair value of 
the investment is less than its carrying value.
 We 
identified the 
qualitative assessment 
of impairment 
of investments 
as a 
critical audit 
matter due 
to the 
significance of 
the 
 balance 
to 
the 
financial 
statements 
as 
a 
whole, 
the 
limited 
availability 
of 
public 
information 
related 
to 
the 
investment 
and 
the 
 subjectivity 
of 
the 
qualitative 
factors 
involved 
in 
the 
assessment. 
There 
were 
significant 
judgments 
and 
estimates 
made 
by 
the 
 Company in their assessment of various factors (including operating 
performance, global and country specific industry prospec 
ts and 
 other company-specific information) to consider whether there were indicators 
of impairment present. 
 This 
required 
complex 
auditor 
judgment, 
and 
an 
increased 
extent 
of 
audit 
effort 
in 
performing 
procedures, 
to 
evaluate 
the 
 reasonableness of management's judgments in reaching this conclusion.
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was 
Addressed in the Audit
 Our principal 
audit procedures over 
the relevant factors 
to be considered 
related to the 
valuation of the 
Company s 
investment 
 in Mobikwik as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value included 
the following, among others: 
 
 Inquired of the Company to obtain an understanding of the Company's process in 
evaluating the indication of impairment.
 
 Tested the effectiveness of controls 
over the Company's evaluation of the fair value of the investment in Mobikwik at period 
 end.
 
 Assessed whether there 
were any 
observable transactions (as 
defined in ASC 
321) and assessed 
the relevant factors 
considered 
 by the Company.
 
 Considered the completeness of internal and external factors to be 
considered in relation to the value of the investment to be 
 recognized in the financial statements.
 
 With the assistance of 
our fair value specialists, we performed 
an independent assessment of the factors 
to consider whether 
 or not the investment needed to be impaired.
 
 Compared the Company's assessment and conclusion to our independent 
assessment.

Finished goods

 that was 
previously classified 
as finished 
goods subject 
to sale restrictions. 
In support 
of Cell C s 
liquidity position 
and pursuant 
to 
 Cell C s 
recapitalization process, 
the Company 
limited the 
resale of 
this airtime 
to its 
own distribution 
channels. On 
September 30, 
 2022, Cell C concluded its recapitalization process and the Company and Cell 
C entered into an agreement under which Cell C 
agreed 
 to 
repurchase, 
from 
October 
2023, 
up 
to 
ZAR 

million 
of 
Cell 
C 
inventory 
from 
the 
Company 
per 
month. 
The 
amount 
to 
be 
 repurchased by Cell C will be calculated as ZAR 

million less the face value of any sales made by the Company during that month. 
 The Company continued to sell a minimum amount 
of Cell C airtime through its internal channels 
in late fiscal 2022/ early fiscal 2023 
 in support 
of Cell 
C s 
liquidity position. 
However, 
its ability 
to sell 
this airtime 
has increased 
significantly since 
the acquisition 
of 
 Connect 
because 
Connect 
is a 
significant 
reseller of 
Cell C 
airtime. 
As a 
result, 
the Company 
has 
sold higher 
volumes of 
airtime 
 through 
this 
channel 
than 
it 
did 
prior 
to 
the 
Cell 
C 
recapitalization, 
however, 
continued 
sales 
at 
these 
volumes 
is 
dependent 
on 
 prevailing conditions 
continuing in 
the airtime 
market. If 
the Company 
is able 
to sell 
at least 
ZAR 

million a 
month through 
this 
 channel from 
October 1, 
2023, then 
Cell C would 
not be 
required to 
repurchase any 
airtime from 
the Company 
during any 
specific 
 month. The 
Company has 
agreed to 
notify Cell 
C prior 
to selling 
any of 
this airtime, 
however, 
there is 
no restriction 
placed on 
the 
 Company on the sale of the airtime.

The Company used a discounted cash flow model developed by the Company to determine 
the fair value of 
 its investment 
in Cell 
C as of 
June 30, 
2023 and 
June 30, 2022,

and valued Cell 
C at 

(zero) and 

(zero) as 
of 
 June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, respectively. 
The Company incorporates the payments under Cell C s 
lease liabilities into the cash 
 flow forecasts 
and assumes that 
Cell C s 
deferred tax 
assets would 
be utilized over 
the forecast period. 
The Company has 
increased 
 the 
marketability 
discount 
from 
 
 to

the 
minority 
discount 
from 
 
 to 
 
 due 
to 
the reduction 
in the 
Company s 
 shareholding percentage from

 Adjustments have been made to the WACC

assessment of risk to Cell C achieving its business plan. 
 The following key valuation inputs were used as of June 30, 2023 and 2022:

The fair value 
of Cell C 
as of June 
30, 2023, utilizing 
the discounted 
cash flow valuation 
model developed 
by the Company 
is 
 sensitive to the following inputs: (i) the ability of Cell C to 
achieve the forecasts in their business case; (ii) the weighted 
average cost 
 of capital WACC 
rate used; 
and (iii) 
the minority 
and marketability 
discount used. 
Utilization of 
different inputs, 
or changes 
to 
 these inputs, may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 

 The following table presents the impact on the carrying value of 
the Company s Cell C investment 
of a 
 
 increase and 

decrease in the WACC rate and the 
EBITDA margins used in 
the Cell C valuation

 rates applicable as of June 30, 2023:

The Company expects to 
hold these shares for 
an extended period 
of time and that 
there will be short-term 
equity price 
 volatility with respect to these shares particularly given the current situation of 
Cell C s business.

year ended 
June 30, 2023, 
related to the 
 other-than-temporary 
decrease 
in 
Finbond s 
value, 
which 
represented 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
determined 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
 Company s 
interest in Finbond 
and the Company s 
carrying value (before 
the impairment). 
There continues 
to be limited 
trading in 
 Finbond 
shares 
on 
the 
JSE 
because 
a 
small 
number 
of 
shareholders 
own 
approximately 

of 
its 
issued 
and 
outstanding 
shares 
 between them. The 
Company calculated a fair 
value per share for 
Finbond by applying a 
liquidity discount of 
 
 to the September 
 30, 
2022, 
Finbond 
closing 
price 
of 
ZAR 
 
 . 
The 
Company 
increased 
the 
liquidity 
discount 
from 

(used 
in 
the 
previous 
 impairment 
assessment) 
to 

(used 
in 
the 
September 
30, 
2022 
assessment) 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
ongoing 
limited 
trading 
activity 
 observed on the JSE. 
 Finbond impairments 
recorded during 
the year ended June 30, 2021
 Finbond published its 
half-year results to 
August 2020 in 
October 2020, which 
included the financial 
impact of the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic on its reported results during that reporting period. 
Finbond incurred losses during the six months to 
August 2020, primarily 
 due to a slow-down in its lending activities. Finbond 
reported that its lending activities had increased again since 
August 2020, albeit 
 at a slower pace compared with the 
prior calendar period. Finbond s share price declined substantially during the period from its 
fiscal 
 year end (February 2020) to September 30, 2020, and the weakness in its traded share 
price continued post September 30, 2020. 
 The 
Company 
considered 
the 
combination 
of 
the 
slow-down 
in 
business 
activity 
and 
the 
lower 
share 
price 
as 
impairment 
 indicators. The 
Company performed 
an impairment 
assessment of 
its holding 
in Finbond 
as of 
September 30, 
2020. The 
Company 
 recorded 
an 
impairment 
loss 
of 

million 
during 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2020, 
related 
to 
the 
other-than-temporary 
 decrease in Finbond s value, which represented the difference between the 
determined fair value of the 
Company s interest in Finbond 
 and the 
Company s 
carrying value 
(before the 
impairment). There 
was limited 
trading in 
Finbond shares 
on the 
JSE because 
it had 

shareholders that owned approximately 
 
 of its issued and outstanding 
shares between them. The Company calculated 
a fair 
 value per share for Finbond by applying a liquidity discount of 
 
 to the September 30, 2020, Finbond closing price of ZAR 
 
 . 
 The Company performed a 
further impairment assessment 
of its holding 
in Finbond as 
of December 31, 2020, 
following a modest 
 further decline 
in its 
market price 
during the 
quarter ended December 
31, 2020. 
The Company 
recorded an 
impairment loss 
of

to 
the 
other-than-temporary

in 
Finbond s 
value, 
which 
 represented the difference between the determined fair value of the Company s interest in Finbond and the Company s 
carrying value 
 (before the

Company calculated 
a fair

of

closing price 
of ZAR 
 
 . The 
total impairment 
charge for 
the year 
ended June

 Carbon 
 In September 
2022, the 
Company, 
through its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, 
Net1 Applied 
Technologies 
Netherlands B.V. Net1 
 BV ), 
entered 
into 
a binding 
term 
sheet 
with the 
Etobicoke 
Limited Etobicoke 
to sell 
its entire 
interest, or 
 
 , 
in Carbon 
to 
 Etobicoke for 

million and a loan 
due from Carbon, with 
a face value of 

million, to Etobicoke for 

million. Both the equity 
 interest and 
the loan 
had a 
carrying value 
of 

(zero) at 
June 30, 
2022. The 
parties have 
agreed that 
Etobicoke pledge 
the Carbon 
 shares purchased as security for the amounts outstanding under the binding term 
sheet. 

 The Company received 

million on closing and the outstanding balance due by Etobicoke is expected to be 
paid as follows: 
 (i) 

million on September 30, 
2023, and (ii) the 
remaining amount, of 

million in March 2024. 
Both amounts are included 
 in the 
caption accounts 
receivable, net 
and other 
receivables in 
the Company s 
consolidated balance 
sheet as 
of June 
30, 2023. 
The 
 Company has allocated the 

million received to the sale of the equity interest and will allocate the funds received first to the sale 
 of the equity interest and then to the loans. 
 The Company currently 
believes that the fair 
value of the Carbon 
shares provided as security 
is 

(zero), which is in 
line with 
 the carrying value as of June 30, 2022, and has created an allowance for 
doubtful loans receivable related to the 

million due from 
 Etobicoke. The Company did not incur any significant 
transaction costs. The Company has included the gain of 

million related 
 to the 
sale of 
the Carbon equity 
interest in the 
caption net gain 
on disposal of 
equity-accounted investments in 
the Company s unaudited

and settle all

 The Company 
signed a 
subscription agreement 
with MobiKwik, 
which is 
one of 
India s 
largest independent 
mobile payments 
 networks and buy now 
pay later businesses. 
Pursuant to the 
subscription agreement, the Company agreed 
to make an 
equity investment 
 of up to 

million in MobiKwik over a 
 
 -month period. The Company made an 
initial 

million investment in August 2016 
 and a 
further 

million investment 
in June 
2017, 
under this 
subscription 
agreement. 
During the 
year ended 
June 30, 
2019, the 
 Company paid 

million to subscribe 
for additional shares in 
MobiKwik. As of 
each of June 30, 
2023 and 2022, respectively, 
the 
 Company owned approximately 
 
 of MobiKwik s issued share capital. 
 In October 
2021, the 
Company converted 
(at a 
rate of 
approximately 

for 1) 
its 

shares of 
compulsorily convertible 
 cumulative 
preferences 
shares 
to 

equity 
shares 
in 
anticipation 
of 
MobiKwik s 
initial 
public 
offering. 
The 
Company s 
 investment 
percentage 
remained 
unchanged 
following 
the 
conversion. 
The 
Company 
did 
not 
identify 
any 
observable 
transactions 
 during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and therefore there was no change in the fair value of MobiKwik during 
 these years. 

 During the year 
ended June 30, 
2021, MobiKwik 
entered into a 
number of separate 
agreements with new 
shareholders to 
raise 
 additional capital through the issuance of additional shares. Specifically, the Company used the following transactions as the basis for 
 its fair value 
adjustments to 
its investment in 
MobiKwik during 
the year ended 
June 30, 2021:

March 
2021, 

post 
conversion) 
per 
share; 
and 
June 
2021, 

post 
 conversion) per share. The Company considered 
each of these transactions to be an observable price change 
in an orderly transaction 
 for similar 
or identical 
equity securities 
issued by 
MobiKwik. The 
Company used 
the November 
2020 valuation 
as the 
basis for 
its 
 adjustment to 
increase the carrying 
value in its 
investment in 
MobiKwik by 

million from 

million to 

million as of 
 December 31, 2020. The 
Company used the March 2021 
valuation as the basis for 
its adjustment to increase the 
carrying value in its 
 investment in 
MobiKwik by 

million from 

million to 

million as 
of March 
31, 2021. 
The Company 
used the

by

 Goodwill 
associated 
with 
the 
acquisition 
of 
Connect 
represents the 
excess 
of 
cost 
over 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
acquired 
net assets. 
 Connect goodwill 
is not deductible 
for tax purposes. 
See Note 3 
for the allocation 
of the purchase 
price to the 
fair value of 
acquired 
 net assets. 
 Impairment loss
 The Company assesses the carrying 
value of goodwill for impairment 
annually, or 
more frequently, 
whenever events occur and 
 circumstances change indicating 
potential impairment. The Company 
performs its annual impairment 
test as at June 30 of 
each year. 
 Except as discussed below, 

goodwill has been impaired during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. 
 Year ended 
June 30, 2023 goodwill impairment loss
 The Company 
recognized an 
impairment loss 
of 

million as 
a result 
of its 
annual impairment 
analysis related 
to goodwill 
 allocated 
to 
its 
hardware/ 
software 
support 
business 
within 
its 
merchant 
operating 
segment. 
The 
impairment 
loss 
resulted 
from 
a 
 reassessment 
of 
the 
business 
growth 
prospects 
given 
the 
change 
in 
customer 
demand 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
cheaper 
 hardware devices which incorporate 
software widely adopted by our customers 
customer-base, coupled with a challenging 
economic 
 environment 
in 
South 
Africa. 
The 
impairment 
is 
included 
within 
the 
caption 
impairment 
loss 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statement 
of 
 operations for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 In order to determine the 
amount of the goodwill 
impairment, the estimated fair value 
of our hardware/ software support business 
 assets and liabilities were compared to the carrying 
value of its assets and liabilities. 
The Company used a discounted cash flow model 
 in order 
to determine 
the fair 
value of 
the business. 
Based on 
this analysis, 
the Company 
determined that 
the carrying 
value of 
the 
 business assets and liabilities exceeded their fair value at the reporting date. 
 In the event that there is a deterioration in the Company s operating segments, or in any other of the Company s 
businesses, this 
 may lead to additional impairments 
in future periods. 
Furthermore, the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses 
may be increased 
 by 
the 
necessity 
of 
integrating 
personnel 
with 
disparate 
business 
backgrounds 
and 
combining 
different 
corporate 
cultures. 
The 
 Company also may not 
be able to retain key 
employees or customers of 
an acquired business or realize 
cost efficiencies or 
synergies 
 or other 
benefits that 
it anticipated 
when selecting 
its acquisition 
candidates. Acquisition 
candidates may 
have liabilities 
or adverse 
 operating 
issues that 
the 
Company 
fails 
to 
discover 
through 
due 
diligence 
prior 
to 
the 
acquisition. 
These 
factors 
may 
also 
lead 
to 
 additional impairments in future periods.

 The Loan 
Documents contain 
customary 
covenants that 
require Lesaka

maintain a 
specified total 
asset cover 
ratio and 
 restrict the ability of Lesaka, Lesaka SA, and certain of its subsidiaries to make 
certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, 
 prepay 
other debt, 
encumber their 
assets, incur 
additional indebtedness, 
make investment 
above specified 
levels, engage

(as defined in the CTA) of Cash Connect Management Solutions 
Proprietary Limited CCMS and K2021 
 Proprietary Limited K2021 from the respective CCMS and 
K2021 valuations. When determining the Covenant Equity Value, 
the 
 value of the aggregate of the CCMS Equity Value 
(as defined in the CTA) and the K2021 Equity Value 
(as defined in the CTA) must 
 be at least 

per cent of the Covenant Equity Value. 
To the extent that the value of the 
aggregate of the CCMS Equity Value 
and the 
 K2021 Equity Value 
is not at least 

per cent of the 
Covenant Equity Value, 
the Covenant Equity Value 
will be reduced so 
that the 
 aggregate of the CCMS Equity Value and the K2021 Equity Value 
is 

per cent of the Covenant Equity Value. The amendments also 
 include the removal of a requirement to maintain a minimum group cash balance. 
 Interest on 
Facility G

will be 
repaid on 
the maturity 
 date, provided that the sum of the outstanding facility (including interest and fees) plus any accrued interest does not exceed 

times 
 of the 
Facilities outstanding 
balance. Any 
interest that 
exceeds this 
cap must 
be settled 
in full 
on a 
quarterly basis. 
The JIBAR 
rate

 on June 30, 2023. 
 Lesaka SA will pay a quarterly commitment fee computed at a rate of 
 
 of the Applicable Margin (as defined in the CTA) on 
 the amount of the revolving credit facility outstanding 
and such commitment fee will also be capitalized, 
subject to the cap discussed 
 above. 
 The Facilities are repayable in full on or before December 31, 2025. 
 The then 
available 
amounts available

 CCC Revolving Credit Facility, comprising 
long-term borrowings 
 On

closed on December 1, 2022. 
 The CCC Loan Document contains 
customary covenants that require CCC and 
K2020 to collectively maintain a 
specified capital 
 adequacy ratio, restrict the ability of the entities to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, 
encumber their assets, 
 incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in certain business

K2020 s existing lending arrangement and 
increases the 
borrowings available to 
facilitate 
 further growth of the 
business. Certain merchant finance 
loans receivable have been 
pledged as security for 
the revolving credit 
facility 
 obtained from

also provided 
RMB with 
an unsecured 
limited guarantee the guarantee 
in respect 
of the 
revolving 
 credit facility entered into between 
K2020 and RMB. The guarantee is limited 
to a maximum aggregate amount of ZAR

million 

million). The credit facility represents an 
indirect and derivative facilities of up 
to ZAR 

million 
 
 million), which include guarantees, letters of credit and forward exchange 
contracts. 
 On November 2, 2020, the Company amended its short-term 
South African credit facility with Nedbank Limited to 
increase the 
 indirect 
and 
derivative 
facilities 
component 
of 
the 
facility 
from 
ZAR 

million 
to 
ZAR 

million. 
On 
June 
1, 
2021, 
the 
 Company 
further 
amended 
its short-term 
South 
African 
credit facility 
with Nedbank 
Limited 
to reduce 
the indirect 
and derivative 
 facilities component of the facility 
from ZAR 

million to ZAR 

million, and to cancel its ZAR 

million general banking 
 facility. During the year ended June 30, 2022, 
the Company cancelled its 
overdraft facility of up to 
ZAR 

million 

million), 
 which was used to fund mobile ATMs 
as it no longer operates a mobile ATM 
service. 
 The Company 
has entered 
into cession 
and pledge 
agreements with 
Nedbank related 
to certain 
of its 
Nedbank credit 
facilities 
 (the general banking 
facility and a 
portion of the 
indirect facility) and 
the Company has 
ceded and pledged 
certain bank accounts 
to 
 Nedbank and also provided a cession of Lesaka SA s 
shareholding in Cell C. The funds included in these bank accounts are restricted 
 as they may not be withdrawn without the express permission of Nedbank. 
 The short-term facility 
provided Nedbank with 
the right to set off 
funds held in certain 
identified Company bank 
accounts with 
 Nedbank against any amounts owed to Nedbank under the facility. 
As of June 30, 2023, these facilities were no longer available. 

 As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 
2022, the Company had utilized approximately 
ZAR 

million 

million) and ZAR 
 
 million 

million), respectively, 
of its indirect and derivative facilities of 
ZAR 

million (June 30, 2022: ZAR 

million) 
 to enable the bank to issue guarantees, letters of credit and forward exchange 
contracts (refer to Note 22). 
 On June 30, 
2022, the Company s 
ZAR 

million bank guarantee 
issued by Nedbank 
to a third 
party expired and 
on July 1, 
 2022, it was replaced with a ZAR 

million bank guarantee issued by RMB to 
the same third party. In July 2022, the Company was 
 able to release 
ZAR 

million in cash 
held in a 
pledged bank 
account with Nedbank 
which was held 
as security against 
the bank 
 guarantee issued by Nedbank, and the ZAR 

million bank guarantee did not require a cash underpin.

of

these 

shares 
sold 
from 
redeemable 
common 
stock 
to 
 additional paid-in-capital during the year ended June 30, 2022. Previously reported periods were not amended because the transaction 
 only impacted equity. 
 The Company has entered 
into a Policy Agreement with 
the IFC Investors (the 
 Policy Agreement ). The 
material terms of the 
 Policy Agreement are described below. 

 Board Rights 
 For so long as the IFC Investors in aggregate beneficially own shares representing at least 
 
 of the Company s common stock, 
 the IFC Investors will have the right to nominate one director to the Company s board of directors. For so long as the IFC Investors in 
 aggregate beneficially 
own shares representing 
at least 
 
 of the 
Company s 
common stock, the 
IFC Investors will 
have the right 
 to appoint 
an observer 
to the 
Company s 
board of 
directors at 
any time 
when they 
have not 
designated, or 
do not 
have the 
right to 
 designate, a director. 
 Put Option 
 Each IFC Investor will have 
the right, upon the occurrence of specified 
triggering events, to require the Company 
to repurchase 
 all of the shares 
of its common stock purchased by 
the IFC Investors pursuant to 
the Subscription Agreement (or upon exercise 
of their 
 preemptive rights 
discussed below). 
Events triggering 
this put 
right relate 
to (1) 
the Company 
being the 
subject of 
a governmental 
 complaint alleging, a court judgment finding or an indictment alleging that the Company (a) engaged in specified corrupt, 
fraudulent, 
 coercive, collusive or obstructive practices; (b) entered into transactions with targets of economic sanctions; or (c) failed to operate its 
 business in compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws; or (2) the Company rejecting a bona fide offer to acquire 
 all of its outstanding Common Stock at a time when it has in place or implements a shareholder rights plan, or adopting a shareholder 
 rights plan triggered by a beneficial ownership 
threshold of less than 
 twenty
 
percent. The put price per share will be 
the higher of the 
 price per 
share paid 
by the 
IFC Investors 
pursuant to 
the Subscription 
Agreement (or 
paid when 
exercising their 
preemptive rights) 
 and the 
volume weighted 
average price 
per share 
prevailing for 
the 

trading days 
preceding the 
triggering event, 
except that 
with 
 respect to a put right triggered by rejection of a bona fide offer, the put price per share will be the highest price offered 
by the offeror. 
 The Company believes that the 
put option has no 
value and, accordingly, has not recognized the put 
option in its consolidated 
financial 
 statements. 
 Registration Rights 
 The Company has agreed 
to grant certain registration 
rights to the IFC Investors 
for the resale of their 
shares of the Company s 
 common stock, including filing a resale shelf registration statement and 
taking certain actions to facilitate resales thereunder. 
 Preemptive Rights 
 For so long as the IFC Investors hold in 
aggregate 
 
 of the outstanding shares of common stock of 
the Company, each Investor 
 will have the right to purchase its pro-rata share of new issuances of securities by the Company, 
subject to certain exceptions.

requires the Remuneration Committee to 
equitably adjust the number 
and kind of shares 
of common stock issued 
 or reserved pursuant to the plan or outstanding awards, the maximum number of shares 
issuable pursuant to awards, the exercise price 
 for awards, 
and other 
affected terms 
of awards 
to reflect 
such event. 
No awards 
may be 
granted under 
the Plan 
after September 
7, 
 2032, but awards granted on or before such date may extend to later dates. 

 Options 
 General Terms of 
Awards 
 Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant, 
 with vesting conditioned upon the recipient s continuous service through the applicable vesting date and expire 

years after the date 
 of grant. The options generally become exercisable in accordance with a 
vesting schedule ratably over a period of 

from the 
 date of grant. The Company issues new shares to satisfy stock option award exercises but may 
also use treasury shares. 
 Valuation 
Assumptions
 The 
fair 
value 
of 
each 
option 
is 
estimated 
on 
the 
date 
of 
grant 
using the 
Cox 
Ross 
Rubinstein 
binomial 
model 
that 
uses the 
 assumptions 
noted 
in 
the 
table 
below. 
The 
estimated 
expected 
volatility 
is 
generally 
calculated 
based 
on 
the 
Company s 
 
 -day 
 volatility. The 
estimated expected life of the 
option was determined based on 
the historical behavior of employees 
who were granted 
 options with similar terms. 

stock options were granted during the year ended June 30, 2023. The table below presents the range of 
 assumptions used to value options granted during the years ended June 30, 2022

period, with 
vesting conditioned 
upon the 
recipient s 
continuous service 
through the 
applicable vesting 
date and 
under certain 
 circumstances, the achievement of certain performance targets, 
as described below. 

 Recipients 
are 
entitled 
to 
all 
rights 
of 
a 
shareholder 
of 
the 
Company 
except 
as 
otherwise 
provided 
in 
the 
restricted 
stock 
 agreements. These 
rights include the 
right to vote 
and receive dividends 
and/or other 
distributions, 
however, any 
or all dividends 
or 
 other 
distributions 
paid 
related 
to 
restricted 
stock 
during 
the period 
of 
such 
restrictions 
shall 
be 
accumulated 
(without 
interest) 
or 
 reinvested in additional shares of common stock, which in either case shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying award 
 or such other restrictions as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine. 
The restricted stock agreements generally 
prohibit transfer 
 of any 
nonvested and 
forfeitable restricted 
stock. If a 
recipient ceases 
to be 
a member 
of the 
Board of 
Directors or 
an employee 
for 
 any reason, 
all shares 
of restricted 
stock that 
are not 
then vested 
and nonforfeitable 
will be immediately 
forfeited and 
transferred to 
 the 
Company 
for 
no 
consideration. 
Forfeited 
shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
are 
available 
for 
future 
issuances 
by 
the 
Remuneration 
 Committee.
 The Company issues new shares to satisfy restricted stock awards. 
 Valuation 
Assumptions 
 The fair value 
of restricted stock 
is generally based 
on the closing 
price of the 
Company s stock 
quoted on The 
Nasdaq Global 
 Select Market on the date of grant.
 Forfeiture of 150,000 shares 
of restricted stock with Market Conditions awarded 
in August 2017
 In August 2017, the Remuneration Committee approved an award 
of 

shares of restricted stock to executive 
officers. The 
 shares of restricted 
stock awarded to 
executive officers 
in August 2017 
were subject to 
a time-based vesting 
condition and a 
market 
 condition and would vest 
in full only on 
the date, if any, 
that the following conditions 
were satisfied: (1) the 
price of the Company s 
 common stock must equal or exceed certain agreed VWAP 
levels (as described below) during a measurement period commencing on 
 the date that 
it filed its Annual 
Report on Form 
10-K for the 
fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2020 
and ending on 
December 31, 2020 
and 
 (2) the recipient 
is employed by the 
Company on a 
full-time basis when 
the condition in 
(1) is met. 
If either of 
these conditions was 
 not satisfied, then 
none of the 
shares of restricted 
stock would vest 
and they would 
be forfeited. The 

price target represented 
 an approximate 
 
 increase, compounded annually, 
in the price of the Company s common stock on 
Nasdaq over the 

closing 
 price on August 23, 2017. The VWAP 
levels and vesting percentages related to such levels were as follows: 
 
 Below 

(threshold) 

At or above 

and below 

At or above 

and below 

At or above 

The 

shares of restricted stock were effectively forward starting knock-in barrier options with multi-strike prices of 
 
 . 
 The fair 
value of 
these shares 
of restricted 
stock was calculated 
utilizing a 
Monte Carlo 
simulation model 
which was 
developed for 
 the purpose 
of the 
valuation of 
these shares. 
For each 
simulated share 
price path, 
the market 
share price 
condition was 
evaluated to 
 determine whether 
or not 
the shares would 
vest under 
that simulation. 
A standard 
Geometric Brownian 
motion process 
was used 
in 
 the forecasting 
of the share 
price instead of 
a jump diffusion 
model, as the 
share price volatility 
was more stable 
compared to 
the 
 highly volatile regime 
of previous 
years. Therefore, the 
simulated share price 
paths capture the 
idiosyncrasies of the 
observed Company 
 share price movements. 

 In scenarios where 
the shares do not 
vest, the final vested 
value at maturity is 
zero. In scenarios where 
vesting occurs, the 
final 
 vested value on maturity is 
the share price on vesting date. The 
value of the grant is the 
average of the discounted vested 
values. The 
 Company used an expected volatility of 
 
 , an expected life of 
approximately 
 
 , a risk-free rate ranging between 

to 
 
 and 

future dividends 
in its 
calculation of 
the fair 
value of 
the restricted 
stock. The 
estimated expected 
volatility was 
 calculated based on the Company s 

VWAP 
share price using the exponentially weighted moving average of returns.

 Market Conditions - Restricted Stock Granted in September 2018 
all forfeited
 In September 2018, the Remuneration Committee approved an award of 

shares of restricted stock to executive officers. 
 The 

shares of restricted stock awarded to executive 
officers in September 2018 are subject 
to a time-based vesting condition 
 and a market 
condition and vest 
in full only 
on the 
date, if 
any, that the following 
conditions are 
satisfied: (1) the 
price of the 
Company s 
 common stock must equal or exceed certain agreed VWAP 
levels (as described below) during a measurement period commencing on 
 the date that 
it files its 
Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for 
the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 
2021 and ending 
on December 31, 
2021 and 
 (2) the recipient is employed by the Company on a full-time basis when the 
condition in (1) is met. If either of these conditions is not 
 satisfied, 
then 
none 
of 
the 
shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
will 
vest 
and 
they 
will 
be 
forfeited. 
The 

price 
target 
represented 
an 
 approximate 
 
 increase, 
compounded annually, 
in the 
price of 
the Company s 
common stock 
on Nasdaq 
over the 

closing 
 price on September 7, 2018. The VWAP 
levels and vesting percentages related to such levels are as follows: 
 
 Below 

(threshold) 

At or above 

and below 

At or above 

and below 

At or above 

The fair value of these shares of restricted stock was calculated using a Monte 
Carlo simulation of a stochastic volatility process. 
 The choice of a stochastic volatility process as an extension to the standard Black Scholes process was driven by both observations of 
 larger than expected moves in the daily time series for the Company s 
VWAP 
price, but also the observation of the strike structure of 
 volatility 
(i.e. 
skew 
and 
smile) 
for 
out-of-the 
money 
calls 
and 
out-of-the 
money 
puts 
versus 
at-the-money 
options 
for 
both 
the 
 Company s stock and NASDAQ futures. 
 In scenarios where 
the shares do not 
vest, the final vested 
value at maturity is 
zero. In scenarios where 
vesting occurs, the 
final 
 vested value on maturity is the share price on 
vesting date. In its calculation of the fair value 
of the restricted stock, the Company used 
 an average volatility of 
 
 for the VWAP 
price, a discounting based on USD overnight indexed swap rates for 
the grant date, and 
 no future dividends. The average volatility was extracted from the time series for VWAP prices as the standard deviation of log prices 
 for the 

preceding the grant date. The mean 
reversion of volatility and the volatility of 
volatility parameters of the stochastic 
 volatility process 
were extracted 
by regressing 
log differences 
against log 
levels of 
volatility from 
the time 
series for 
at-the-money 
 options 

volatility quotes, which were available from January 2, 2018 onwards. 
 During 
the year 
ended June 
30, 2022, 
an executive 
officer forfeited 

shares of 
restricted 
stock that 
were subject 
to the 
 market conditions described above because the performance conditions were not met. During the year ended June 30, 2021, executive 
 officers forfeited 

shares of restricted 
stock that were 
subject to the 
market conditions described above 
following their separation 
 from the Company.

 average between 
the opening 
net equity 
and closing 
net equity

measurement period. 
The targeted 
 return per year within the measurement period is derived from GAAP net income 
attributable to the Company per fiscal year.

 Market Conditions - Restricted Stock Granted in May 2021 and 
July 2021
 In May 
2021 and 
July 2021, 
respectively, 
the Remuneration 
Committee 
approved 
an award 
of 

and 

shares of 
 restricted stock to executive officers. These shares of restricted stock awarded to executive officers are subject to a 
time-based vesting 
 condition and a market condition and vest in full 
only on the date, if any, that the following conditions are satisfied: (1) a 
compounded 
 annual 
 
 appreciation in the Company s 
stock price over the measurement period commencing on June 
30, 2021 through June 30,

when 
the 
condition 
in 
(1) 
is 
met. 
If 
either 
of 
these 
 conditions is not satisfied, then none of the shares 
of restricted stock will vest and they will 
be forfeited. The Company s closing stock 
 price on Nasdaq on June 30, 2021, was 
 
 . 

 The appreciation levels (times and price) and vesting percentages as of each 
period ended related to such levels are as follows: 
 
 Prior to the first anniversary of the grant date: 

Fiscal 2022, stock price as of June 30, 2022 is

 Market Conditions - Restricted Stock Granted in December 2022
 In December 2022, the Remuneration 
Committee approved an award of 

shares of restricted stock to executive 
officers. 
 The 

shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
awarded 
to 
executive 
officers 
are 
subject 
to 
a 
time-based 
vesting 
condition 
and 
a 
market 
 condition and vest 
in full only 
on the date, 
if any, that the 
following conditions are 
satisfied: (1) a 
compounded annual 
 
 appreciation 
 in 
the 
Company s 
stock 
price 
off 
a 
base 
price 
of 

over 
the 
measurement 
period 
commencing 
on 
December 
1, 
2022 
through 
 December 1, 2025, and (2) the recipient is employed by the Company on a full-time basis when the condition in (1) is 
met. If either of 
 these conditions is not satisfied, then none of the shares of 
restricted stock will vest and they will be 
forfeited. The Company s closing 
 price on December 1, 2022, was 
 
 . 
 The appreciation levels (times and price) and vesting percentages as of each 
period ended are as follows: 
 
 Prior to the first anniversary of the grant date: 
 
 ; 
 
 Fiscal 2024, stock price as of December 1, 2023 is 

times higher (i.e. 

or higher) than 
 
 : 
 
 ; 
 
 Fiscal 2025, stock price as of December 1, 2024 is 

times higher (i.e. 

or higher) than 
 
 : 
 
 ; 
 
 Fiscal 2026, stock price as of December 1, 2025 is 

times higher (i.e. than 4.94: 
 
 . 
 The fair value of these shares of restricted stock was calculated using a Monte Carlo 
simulation. 

 In scenarios where 
the shares do not 
vest, the final vested 
value at maturity is 
zero. In scenarios where 
vesting occurs, the 
final 
 vested value on maturity is the share price on 
vesting date. In its calculation of the fair value 
of the restricted stock, the Company used 
 an equally 
weighted volatility 
of 
 
 for 
the closing 
price (of 
 
), a discounting 
based on 
U.S. dollar 
overnight indexed 
swap 
 rates for the grant date, and no 
future dividends. The equally weighted 
volatility was extracted from the 
time series for closing prices 
 as the standard deviation of log prices for the three years preceding the grant date. 
 Restricted Stock Units 
 The Remuneration Committee 
may approve the 
grant of other 
stock-based awards. In 
April 2022, the 
Company granted 
 
 shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
to 
employees 
of 
Connect 
pursuant 
to 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
acquisition. 
The 
award 
included 
an 
equalization 
 mechanism to 
maintain a 
return of 

per share 
of restricted 
stock upon 
vesting through 
the issue 
of restricted 
stock units. 
The 
 conversion of restricted stock units to shares cannot exceed 
 
 under the terms of the award and therefore no more than 

(or 

divided by 
two) would 
be issued 
upon vesting. 
During the 
year ended 
June 30, 
2023, 

shares of 
restricted stock 
 vested, 
and 

restricted 
stock units 
vested, 
the maximum 
amount possible, 
and 
were converted 
to shares 
of common 
stock. 
 Employees elected 
for 

shares to 
be withheld 
from 

restricted stock 
units which 
vested, and 
which were 
converted to 
 shares, in order 
to satisfy the withholding 
tax liability on 
the vesting of 
these shares. These 

shares have been 
included in our 
 treasury shares. 
 Stock Appreciation Rights 

 The Remuneration Committee may also grant stock appreciation rights, either 
singly or in tandem with underlying stock 
options. 
 Stock appreciation rights entitle the holder upon exercise to receive an amount in any combination of cash or shares of common stock 
 (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) 
equal in value to the 
excess of the fair 
market value of the shares 
covered by the right 
 over the grant price. 

stock appreciation rights have been granted.

 to employees during the 
years ended June 30, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. 
On August 5, 2020, the Company

The number 
of forfeitures 
during the 
year ended 
June 30, 
2021, increased 
significantly compared 
to prior 
periods as 
a 
 result of the closure of our IPG operations during the latter half of calendar 2020 and the unrelated (to 
the IPG closure) resignation of 
 various employees 
in the 
first half 
of calendar 
2021. The 
stock options 
forfeited had 
strike prices 
ranging from 

to

 addition, the Company s former chief executive officer forfeited 

stock options with strike 
prices ranging from 

to 
 
 per share following his separation from the Company during the year

and 

shares 
 of restricted stock, respectively, to employees 
and an executive officer which have time-based vesting conditions. In December 
2022, 
 the Company awarded 

shares of restricted 
stock to executive officers 
which contained time 
and performance-based (market 
 conditions related to 
share price performance) vesting 
conditions. The Company 
also agreed to match, 
on a 
 
 -for-one basis, (1) 
an 
 employee s purchase of up to 

million worth of the Company s shares of common stock in open market purchases, and in August 
 2022, the Company granted 

shares of restricted stock to the employee, and (2) another employee s purchase of up to 
 
 shares 
of 
the 
Company s 
common 
stock, 
and 
in 
November 
2022, 
the 
Company 
granted

of 
restricted

to 
the 
 employee. 
These 
shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
contain 
time-based 
vesting 
conditions. 
The 
Company 
awarded 

shares 
to 
an 
 executive officer on December 31, 2022, which vested on the date 
of the award. 
 On June 30, 2021, the Company 
entered into employment agreements with 
Mr. Chris G.B. 
Meyer, under which 
Mr. Meyer was 
 appointed Group Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective July 
1, 2021. Mr. Meyer was awarded 

shares of restricted 
 stock on July 
1, 2021, which were 
subject to time-based 
vesting and vest 
in full on June 
30, 2024, subject 
to Mr. 
Meyer s continued 
 service to the 
Company through June 
30, 2024. In 
addition, under the 
terms of Mr. Meyer s engagement, the 
Company s Remuneration 
 Committee also awarded Mr. Meyer 

shares of restricted stock which include performance conditions and which only vest on 
 June 30, 
2024 if 
the performance 
conditions are 
met and 
Mr. 
Meyer remains 
employed with 
the Company 
through June 
30, 2024. 
 Vesting 
of 
half 
of 
these 
awards, 
or 

shares 
of 
restricted 
stock, 
is 
subject 
to 
the Company 
achieving 
its 

financial 
 services plan during the specific measurement period from June 30, 2021, to June 30, 2024, and the other half is subject to share price 
 growth 
targets, 
and only 
vest if 
the Company s 
share price 
is 

or higher 
on June 
30, 2024. 
On March 
1, 2022, 
the Company 
 awarded 

shares of restricted 
stock to executive 
officers and 
vesting of these 
awards is subject 
to the executive s 
continuous 
 service through 
the applicable vesting 
date, one 
third of which 
vests on each 
of the first, 
second and third 
anniversaries of 
the grant 
 date. 
 In 
August 
2021, 
December 
2021, 
February 
2022, 
and 
May 
2022, 
the 
Company 
awarded 
 
 , 
 
 , 

and 
 
 shares of restricted stock, respectively, to employees which 
have time and performance-based (market conditions 
related to share price 
 performance) vesting conditions. 
 On 
April 
14, 
2022, 
the 
Company 
granted 

shares 
of 
restricted 
stock 
to 
employees 
of 
Connect 
pursuant 
to 
the 
Sale 
 Agreement. The 
award includes 
an equalization 
mechanism to 
maintain a 
return of 

per share 
of restricted 
stock upon 
vesting 
 through the issue of restricted stock units. The conversion of restricted stock units to shares cannot exceed 
 
 under the terms of the 
 award. 
 Upon joining the Company, each of Messrs. Meyer and Lincoln C. Mali, were entitled to receive an award of shares of restricted 
 stock which were subject to them purchasing an agreed value of 
shares matching awards in the market during a prescribed period 
 of time. However, these 
executives were unable to 
purchase shares in 
the market during 
that period due 
to a Company-imposed 
insider-
 trading 
restriction 
placed 
on 
them. 
On 
November 
15, 
2021, 
the 
Company 
amended 
the 
terms 
of 
these 
awards 
in 
order 
to 
put 
the 
 executives into an economically equivalent position, as follows: 
 (i) assume 
that the 
executives would 
have purchased 
their agreed 
allocation within 
their first 

days post 
commencement of 
 employment had they not been embargoed; 
 (ii) require the 
executives to fulfill 
their agreed allocations 
within a short 
period following release 
of the Company s 
Quarterly 
 Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2021; 
 (iii) to the 
extent that the 
price per share 
actually paid is 
greater than the 
 
 -day volume-weighted 
average price VWAP 
in 
 their respective first 
months of employment, award 
the executives a 
top-up top up awards 
which amounts to 
the after-tax difference 
 between (a) number of shares purchased at 
the 
 
 -day VWAP in their respective first months of employment and (b) number of 
shares 
 purchased at the actual share price paid. The top-up will be settled as follows: (a) 
 
 in shares of the Company s common stock and 
 (b) 
 
 , at the election of 
the executive, as either shares 
of the Company s common stock or cash. The top 
up awards were not subject 
 to any vesting conditions and vested immediately; and 
 (iv) 
adjust the initial matching awards to the aggregate number of shares acquired in terms of (ii) and (iii). The matching awards 
 vest ratably over a period of three years commencing on the first anniversary 
of the grant of the matching awards. 
 The 
executives 
acquired 
shares 
during 
November 
and 
December 
2021, 
and 
the 
Company 
granted 
the 
executives 
 
 matching 
awards and 

top up 
awards. In 
May 2022, 
the Company 
amended the 
terms of 
these awards 
to change 
the vesting 
 dates from when the 
shares were acquired in 
November and December 2021 
to the anniversary of 
the executive s 
date of joining the 
 Company. The shares 
continue to vest ratably over three years on the applicable vesting date.

 Tax consequences 
 The Company

deferred tax 
asset of 
approximately 

million and 

million, respectively, 
for the 
years ended 
 June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, 
the Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately 
 
 million and 

million respectively, 
related to the 
deferred tax asset 
because it does 
not believe that 
the stock-based compensation 
 deduction would be utilized as it does not anticipate generating 
sufficient taxable income in the United States. The Company 
deducts

between

The change 
in the 
income tax 
rate was 
enacted on 
 January 5, 2023, 
and accordingly all deferred 
taxes assets and 
liabilities have been 
remeasured to the 
new tax rate. 
This has resulted 
 in 
the 
inclusion 
of 
an 
income 
tax 
benefit 
of 

million 
in 
the 
Company s 
income 
tax 
(benefit) 
expense 
line 
in 
its 
consolidated 
 statements of operations for each of the year ended June 30, 2023, 
as a result of the reversal of a portion of the deferred tax assets and 
 liabilities recognized as 
of December 31, 2022. 
There were 

changes to the enacted 
tax rates in the years 
ended June 30, 2022 
and 
 2021. 
 The 
Company s 
current income 
tax 
expense for 
the year 
ended June 
30, 
2023, 
was higher 
than 
the previous 
year 
due 
to 
the 
 acquisition of Connect, which is profitable and generates taxable income.
 The Company s 
deferred taxation 
(benefit) charge 
for the year 
ended June 
30, 2023, 
was higher 
than the previous 
year due 
to 
 the inclusion of 
the deferred tax 
benefit recorded related 
to the amortization 
of intangible assets recognized 
due to the 
acquisition of 
 Connect. The 
amount for 
the year 
ended June 
30, 2023, 
also includes 
a deferred 
tax benefit 
related to 
an expense 
paid by 
Connect 
 before the 
Company acquired 
the business 
and which 
subsequently 
determined to 
be deductible 
for tax 
purposes of 
approximately 

million. During the years ended June 
30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company 
incurred net operating losses through certain 
of its 
 South African wholly-owned subsidiaries and recorded a deferred taxation benefit related to these losses. However, 
the Company has 
 created a valuation allowance for certain of these net operating 
losses which reduced the deferred taxation benefit recorded.

liability 
created 
related 
to 
the 
fair 
 adjustment to 
the Company s 
investment in 
MobiKwik (refer 
to Note 
9). The 
capital gains 
differential 
for the 
year ended 
June 30, 
 2021, represents the impact of the reversal of the 
deferred tax liability related to one of the Company s 
equity-accounted investments 
 following its impairment (refer to Note 9). 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
 Deferred 
income taxes 
reflect the 
temporary 
differences 
between 
the 
financial 
reporting and 
tax bases 
of assets 
and 
liabilities 
 using enacted tax rates 
in effect for the 
year in which 
the differences are expected 
to reverse. The 
primary components of the 
temporary 
 differences that gave rise to the Company s 
deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, and their classification, were as follows:

Net operating loss carryforwards

 Management believes, 
based on 
the weight 
of available 
positive and 
negative evidence 
it is 
more likely 
than not 
that the 
Company 
 will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. 
However, the amount of the deferred tax asset 
 considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable 
income are revised. 
 At June

the Company

 contravention of this Code, such 
Employee must promptly and confidentially advise 
their line manager, 
the Head 
 of Human Resources or a member of the Compliance Department 
(provided such person was not involved in the 
 alleged violation). 

 Lesaka s efforts to ensure observance of, and adherence to, the goals and policies outlined in this Code mandate 
 that you must 
promptly bring to 
the attention of 
your line manager, 
the Head of 
Human Resources 
or a member 
 of 
the 
Compliance 
Department 
(provided 
such 
person 
was 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
alleged 
violation) 
any 
material 
 transaction, relationship, 
act, failure 
to act, 
occurrence or 
practice that 
you believe, 
in good 
faith, is 
inconsistent 
 with, in violation of, 
or reasonably could 
be expected to 
give rise to a 
violation of, this Code. 
In the event that 
an 
 Employee feels unable to 
report such matters via 
the aforementioned channels, 
then the Lesaka 
Whistleblowing 
 Hotline is available for safe and anonymous reporting of 
any potential breaches of this policy. 
 The matter will 
be investigated 
and dealt 
with according 
to the Lesaka s 
Whistleblowing Policy. 
Failure to 
report 
 violations of this Code will itself be considered a serious 
violation of this Code. 

 It is Lesaka s 
policy that no 
retaliation or other 
adverse action will 
be taken against 
any Employee for 
good-faith 
 reports 
of 
Code 
violations. 
Persons 
who 
discriminate, 
retaliate 
or 
harass 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
civil, 
criminal 
and 
 administrative penalties, as well as disciplinary action, up to 
and including termination of employment for cause. 

 Managers set an example for other Employees 
and are often responsible for directing the 
actions of others. Every 
 manager and 
supervisor is 
expected to 
take necessary 
actions to 
ensure compliance 
with this 
Code, to 
provide 
 guidance and assist Employees in resolving questions concerning this Code and to permit Employees to express 
 any concerns regarding compliance with this Code. 

No one has the authority to order another Employee to 
act in a manner that is contrary to this Code. 
 2.2.
 
WAIVERS OF OR AMENDMENTS 
TO THIS CODE 

 Any waivers of or amendments to this Code must be 
in writing and must be approved in advance by the Board. 

 Waivers 
and 
amendments, 
and 
the 
reason 
therefore, 
shall 
be 
disclosed 
as required 
under 
applicable 
law 
and 
 regulations. If Employees are in 
doubt about the application of 
this Code, they should discuss the 
matter with their 
 line manager, the Head of 
Human Resources, or the Compliance Department. 

3. 
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS 
 Employees must 
comply with 
all applicable 
laws, rules 
and regulations 
which relate 
to their activities 
for and 
on 
 behalf of Lesaka. Lesaka will not tolerate any violation of the law or unethical business dealing by any Employee, 
 including any payment for, 
or other participation in, an illegal act, such as bribery. 

 Lesaka is committed 
to full 
compliance with 
the laws, 
rules and 
regulations of 
the cities, 
states and 
countries in 
 which it 
operates. You 
must comply 
with all 
applicable laws, 
rules and 
regulations in 
performing your 
duties for 
 Lesaka. 

 Numerous federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations define and establish obligations with which Lesaka, 
 its 
Employees 
and 
agents 
must 
comply. 
Under 
certain 
circumstances, 
local 
country 
law 
may 
establish 
 requirements that differ from this Code. 

 You are expected 
to comply with all local country laws in conducting Lesaka s 
business. If you violate these laws 
 or 
regulations 
in 
performing 
your 
duties 
for 
Lesaka, 
you 
not 
only 
risk 
individual 
indictment, 
prosecution 
and 
 penalties, as well as civil actions and penalties, but also 
subject Lesaka to the same risks and penalties. 

 If you violate 
these laws in 
performing duties for 
Lesaka, you 
will be subjected 
to immediate disciplinary 
action, 
 including possible termination of your employment or affiliation 
with Lesaka. 

 Employees must ensure that their conduct cannot 
be interpreted as being in any way in contravention 
of 
 applicable laws, rules and regulations governing the operations 
of 
 Lesaka
 . 
 3.1.
 
FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT 
 Lesaka 
Employees 
are 
expressly 
prohibited 
from, 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
offering 
payment, 
promising 
to 
pay, 
or 
 authorizing the 
payment of 
any money, 
or offering 
any gift 
or non-monetary 
offer or 
benefit, promising 
to give 
a 
 gift or 
non-monetary offer or benefit, 
or authorizing the 
giving of anything 
of value to 
any foreign and/or 
local official 
 or any foreign political 
party, 
official of any foreign 
political party, 
or candidate for governmental 
or political office 
 for purposes of: 

Influencing any act 
or decision of 
that foreign 
and/or local official, 
political party or 
candidate in his/ 
her/ 
 its official capacity; 

Inducing that foreign and/or local 
official, candidate or political party to do 
or omit to do any act 
in violation 
 of the lawful duty of that official, candidate or 
party, or 

Securing any improper advantage; or 

Inducing that foreign and/or local 
official, candidate or political party to use 
his/ her/ its influence with local 
 and/or foreign government or instrumentality to affect or 
influence any act or decision of that government 
 or instrumentality, 
in order to assist Lesaka or 
its employee in obtaining or retaining 
business for or with, 
 or directing business to, Lesaka. 

 Various countries also have laws that 
prohibit commercial bribery. Accordingly, these laws are not limited 
in scope 
 to bribery of foreign and/or 
local officials 
and typically prohibit bribes 
or inducements to an individual 
or business 
 to improperly influence decision-making. 

 As such, it is Lesaka s policy that nothing of value 
should be provided to any person for the purpose of improperly 
 obtaining or retaining business or otherwise gaining an improper business advantage. Violations of this policy are 
 taken very seriously, 
as they can subject both 
Lesaka and the individual to 
criminal and civil penalties, 
up to and 
 including imprisonment. Therefore, 
any contravention of such laws and 
regulations will result in disciplinary action 
 as detailed in the Code of Conduct. 
 3.2.
 
COPYRIGHTED OR LICENSED MATERIAL 

 It is both illegal and unethical to engage in practices that violate 
copyright laws or licensing agreements. 

 Lesaka requires 
that all 
employees respect 
the rights 
conferred by 
such laws 
and agreements 
and refrain 
from 
 making unauthorized copies of protected materials, including but 
not limited to printed matter, musical recordings, 
 and computer software. 

 Any Employee who is found to have violated copyright 
laws will be subject to a disciplinary action. 

3.3.
 
COMPETITIVE RELATIONSHIPS 

 It is 
unethical and 
unlawful to 
collaborate with 
competitors or 
their agents 
or representatives 
for the 
purpose of 
 establishing or 
maintaining rates 
or prices 
at any 
particular level, 
or to 
collaborate in 
any way 
in the 
restraint of 
 trade. 
 It is 
prohibited 
and 
unlawful 
to collaborate 
or collude 
with competitors 
that 
are in 
a horizontal 
relationship 
with 
 Lesaka for the 
purposes of substantially preventing 
or lessening competition in 
a market. 
Any Employee of 
Lesaka 
 who is 
found to 
have violated 
the Competition 
laws in 
any of 
the jurisdictions 
in which 
Lesaka operates, 
will be 
 subject to disciplinary action. 

4. 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 

 Employees 
are 
expected 
to 
perform 
their 
duties 
conscientiously, 
honestly 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
best 
 interests of Lesaka to optimize business objectives. 

 Employees must not use 
their positions, or 
knowledge gained through 
their employment with 
Lesaka, for private 
 or personal advantage 
or in such 
a manner that 
a conflict or 
an appearance of 
conflict arises between 
Lesaka s 
 interest and their personal interests. 

 A conflict could 
arise where an 
Employee s family, 
or a business 
with which 
an Employee 
or his or 
her family is 
 associated obtains a gain, advantage or profit, or there is the appearance of a gain, advantage 
or profit, by virtue 
 of the Employee s position with Lesaka or knowledge 
gained through that position. 

 Every 
Employee 
must 
promptly 
inform 
Lesaka 
of 
any 
business 
opportunities 
that 
come 
to 
his 
or 
her 
attention 
 through the use of Lesaka assets, property 
or information or that relate to 
the existing or prospective business 
of 
 Lesaka. 

 If Employees feel 
that a course 
of action which 
they have pursued, 
are pursuing 
or are contemplating 
pursuing, 
 may 
involve 
them 
in 
a 
conflict 
of 
interest 
situation 
or 
a 
perceived 
conflict 
of 
interest 
situation, 
they 
should 
 immediately make all 
the facts known 
to the person 
to whom they 
report and the 
Head of Human 
Resources, or 
 Compliance Department.
 4.1. 
OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES, EMPLOYMENT AND 
DIRECTORSHIP 
 We all share a very real responsibility to contribute to our local communities, and Lesaka encourages Employees 
 to participate in religious, charitable, educational and civic 
activities. 

 Employees should, however, 
avoid acquiring any business interest or 
participating in any activity outside 
Lesaka 
 which would create, or appear to create: 

An 
excessive 
demand 
upon 
their 
time, 
attention 
and 
energy which 
would 
deprive 
Lesaka 
of their 
best 
 efforts on the job; or 

A 
conflict 
of 
interest 
- 
that 
is, 
an 
obligation, 
interest 
or 
distraction 
which 
would 
interfere 
or 
appear 
to 
 interfere with their independent exercise of judgment in Lesaka s 
best interest. 

 Employees other than outside directors may not take up outside employment without the prior written approval of 
 the Head of Human Resources. 
 Employees 
who 
hold, or 
have been 
invited to 
hold, 
outside directorships 
should 
take particular 
care 
to 
ensure 
 compliance 
with 
all 
provisions 
of 
this 
Code. 
When 
outside 
business 
directorships 
are 
being 
considered 
by 
 Employees other than outside directors, 
prior written approval must be obtained 
from the Chief Executive Officer 
 of Lesaka or Executive Director responsible for the division. 

 4.1. RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH CLIENTS, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS 

 Lesaka recognizes 
that relationships 
with clients, customers 
and suppliers 
give rise to 
many potential situations 
 where conflicts of interest, real or perceived, may arise. 

 Employees 
should 
ensure 
that 
they 
are 
independent, 
and 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
independent, 
from 
any 
business 
 organization 
having 
a 
contractual 
relationship 
with 
Lesaka 
or providing 
goods 
or services 
to Lesaka, 
if such 
a 
 relationship 
might 
influence 
or 
create 
the 
impression 
of 
influencing 
their 
decisions 
in 
the 
performance 
of 
their 
 duties on behalf of Lesaka. 

 In such circumstances, Employees 
should not invest in, 
or acquire a 
financial interest, directly or 
indirectly, in such 
 an organization. 
 4.2.
 
GIFTS, HOSPITALITY 
AND FAVOURS 

Conflicts of interest can arise 
where Employees are offered gifts, hospitality or 
other favours which might, or 
could 
 be perceived 
to, influence 
their judgment 
in relation 
to business 
transactions such 
as the 
placing of 
orders and 
 contracts. 
 An Employee should 
not accept gifts, 
hospitality or other 
favours from suppliers 
of goods or 
services to Lesaka. 
 However, the acceptance of 
the following would not be considered contrary to such 
policy: 

Promotional matter of limited commercial value; 

Occasional business entertaining such as lunches, cocktail 
parties or dinners; and 

Occasional personal hospitality such as tickets to sporting 
events or theatres. 
 Any 
bribe 
or 
attempted 
bribe 
must 
be 
reported 
to 
the 
Employee s 
line 
manager 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
It 
is 
the 
 intention that dealings with any supplier that offers 
bribes will be terminated. 
 Certain functions 
or operating 
areas may 
have more 
detailed rules 
governing 
the receipt 
of gifts, 
hospitality 
or 
 other favours. 
 In addition, no bribes of 
any kind should be made 
by any Lesaka Employee to any customer 
or potential customer 
 to secure business. 
 Providing the occasional gifts to customers, as set out 
below, would not be considered 
contrary to such a policy: 

Advertising matter of limited commercial value; 

Occasional business entertaining such as lunches, cocktail 
parties or dinners; and 

Occasional personal hospitality such as tickets to sporting 
events or theatres. 
 4.3.
 Employees of the Lesaka Group may accept gifts from Third Parties (other than Government Officials) that are of 
 modest 
value 50 
USD 
or 
less), 
provided 
the 
gift 
and 
entertainment 
guidelines 
stated 
in 
the 
Gifts 
and 
 Entertainment policy, 
are satisfied.

4.4.
 
PERSONAL INVESTMENTS 
 Lesaka respects the 
right of all 
Employees to make 
personal investment decisions as 
they see fit, 
as long as 
these 
 decisions do not contravene any provisions of this Code, any applicable legislation, or any policies or procedures 
 established by the various operating areas of Lesaka, and provided these decisions are not made on the basis of 
 material non-public information acquired by reason of an Employee s 
connection with Lesaka. 
 Employees should not permit their personal investment 
transactions to have priority over transactions for 
Lesaka 
 and its clients. 
 When considering the application of this section, Employees should ensure that no investment decision made for 
 their 
own 
account 
could 
reasonably 
be 
expected 
to 
adversely 
influence 
their 
judgment 
or 
decisions 
in 
the 
 performance of their duties on behalf of Lesaka. 
 Employees involved in performing 
investment activities on behalf 
of Lesaka and those who 
by the nature of their 
 duties 
or positions 
are 
exposed 
to price 
-sensitive 
information 
relating 
to 
Lesaka 
are subject 
to additional 
rules 
 governing 
personal 
investments. 
These 
may 
be 
imposed 
by 
the 
Companies 
Act, 
the 
Stock 
Exchange 
of 
 Johannesburg, 
Banks Act, 
Financial Sector 
Conduct 
Authority, 
Securities 
Regulation Panel, 
the Securities 
and 
 Exchange Commission, NASDAQ and other regulatory bodies, 
industry associations and management. 
 The rules include requirements for all Employees to: 

Obtain prior 
written approval 
from their 
line manager 
and the 
Compliance 
Officer 
for, 
and to 
report on, 
 their personal 
investment 
activity and 
the 
investment 
activity of 
those 
persons 
with whom 
they have 
a 
 close relationship; and 

Refrain 
from 
dealing 
in 
the 
shares 
of 
entities 
that 
Lesaka 
deals 
with 
during 
certain 
restricted/closed 
 periods, as well as Lesaka subsidiaries and associates. 

 4.5.
 
INSIDER INFORMATION 
AND INSIDER TRADING 

 Employees 
may 
receive 
information 
concerning 
Lesaka 
or 
one 
of 
its 
affiliates, 
business 
partners, 
clients, 
or 
 customers 
that 
is 
confidential 
and 
not 
generally 
known 
by 
the 
public. 
If 
that 
information 
is 
 material 
(i.e., 

publication of that information is likely 
to affect the market price 
of the stock of the entity to which 
the information 
 relates), then the Employee has an ethical and legal obligation 
not to: 

Act on that information (i.e., buy or sell stock based on 
that information); 

Disclose that information to others; or 

Advise others to buy or sell the stock of the entity to which that information relates, 
until such information 
 becomes public. 

 An Employee s direct 
or indirect 
use of 
or sharing 
of such 
confidential, privileged, or 
otherwise proprietary business 
 information of Lesaka 
or its partners, 
clients, or customers 
for financial gain, 
including investment by 
the Employee 
 or 
the 
transmission 
of 
this 
information 
to 
others 
so 
that 
they 
can 
use 
this 
information 
for 
their 
financial 
gain, 
 constitutes insider 
trading, which 
is a 
criminal offense. 
Please refer 
to Lesaka s 
Insider Trading 
Policy for 
more 
 information. 

 4.6.
 
REMUNERATION 
 No Employee 
may receive 
commissions 
or other 
remuneration 
related 
to the 
sale of 
any product

of 
 Lesaka except

cases of 
actual or 
suspected discrimination 
to their 
line managers 
or the 
Head of 
 Human Resources. 

 Employees with illnesses 
or disabilities may continue 
to work, provided that 
they are able to 
continue to perform 
 satisfactorily the essential 
duties of their 
jobs and do 
not present a 
safety or health 
hazard to themselves 
or others. 
 5.2.
 
HEALTH AND SAFETY 

 Lesaka is committed to taking every reasonable precaution to ensure a safe work environment for all employees. 

 Employees who become aware of circumstances relating to Lesaka s operations or activities which pose 
a real or 
 potential health or safety 
risk should report 
the matter to their 
line manager and 
the Head of Human 
Resources. 
 It is Lesaka s 
policy that no 
retaliation or other 
adverse action will 
be taken against 
any employee for 
good-faith 
 reports. 

 5.3.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 

 Lesaka is 
committed to developing 
operating policies to 
address the environmental 
impact of 
its business activities 
 by 
integrating 
pollution 
control, 
waste 
management

activities 
into 
operating 
procedures. 
 Employees should give appropriate and timely attention to 
environmental issues. 

 5.4.
 
POLITICAL SUPPORT 

 Lesaka 
accepts 
the 
personal 
participation 
of 
its 
Employees 
in 
the 
political 
process 
and 
respects 
their 
right 
to 
 absolute privacy 
with regard 
to personal 
political activity. 
Lesaka will 
not attempt 
to influence 
any such 
activity 
 provided there is no disruption to workplace activities and it does 
not contribute to industrial unrest. 

 Lesaka funds, goods 
or services, however, may 
not be 
used as 
contributions to political 
parties or 
their candidates. 
 However, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
legitimate 
need 
to 
make 
a 
donation 
to 
a 
political 
party, 
this 
must 
receive 
specific 
 approval from the Social and Ethics committee of the Board. 

6. 
LESAKA S FUNDS, PROPERTY AND RECORDS 
 6.1.
 
FUNDS AND PROPERTY 

 Lesaka 
has 
developed 
a 
number 
of 
internal 
controls 
to 
safeguard 
its 
assets 
and 
imposes 
strict 
standards 
to 
 prevent 
fraud 
and 
dishonesty. 
It 
is 
every 
Employee s 
responsibility 
to 
implement, 
maintain 
and 
enhance 
the 
 effectiveness of the control environment in which 
they operate. 

 All Employees who have access to 
Lesaka s funds in any form must at 
all times follow prescribed procedures 
for 
 recording, handling and protecting such funds. 

Operating areas may 
implement policies and 
procedures relating to 
the safeguarding of 
Lesaka property, including 
 computer software and intellectual property. 

 Employees must at 
all times ensure 
that Lesaka s funds and 
property are used 
only for legitimate 
Lesaka business 
 purposes. Where an Employee requires Lesaka funds to be spent, it is the Employee s responsibility to use good 
 judgment 
on 
Lesaka s 
behalf 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
value 
and 
authorization 
is 
received 
for 
such 
 expenditure. 

 All 
payments 
made 
by 
or 
on 
behalf 
of 
Lesaka 
for 
any 
purpose 
must 
be 
fully 
and 
accurately 
described 
in 
the 
 documents and 
records supporting 
the payment. 
No false, 
improper, 
or misleading 
entries shall 
be made 
in the 
 books and records of Lesaka. 

 Complete and accurate information is to be given in response to inquiries from Lesaka s Compliance Department 
 and independent auditors. 

 If Employees 
become aware 
of any 
evidence that 
Lesaka funds 
or property 
may have 
been or 
are likely 
to be 
 used in a fraudulent 
or improper manner 
they should immediately 
and confidentially advise 
Lesaka as set 
out in 
 the compliance with this Code section of this document. 

 It is Lesaka s 
policy that no 
retaliation or other 
adverse action will 
be taken against 
any employee for 
good-faith 
 reports. 

 6.2.
 
RECORDS
 Accurate and reliable 
records of many 
kinds are necessary 
to meet Lesaka s 
legal and financial 
obligations and 
 to 
manage 
the 
affairs 
of 
Lesaka. 
Lesaka s 
books 
and 
records 
should 
reflect 
all 
business 
transactions 
in 
an 
 accurate and timely manner. 

 Undisclosed 
or 
unrecorded 
revenues, 
expenses, 
assets 
or 
liabilities 
are 
not 
permissible, 
and 
the 
Employees 
 responsible for accounting and record-keeping functions are expected to be 
diligent in enforcing proper practices.

person the employee currently 
resides 
 with in an intimate, romantic or sexual relationship. 

 If such 
a situation 
should arise, 
it should 
be immediately 
brought to 
the attention 
of a direct 
manager of 
Human 
 Resources. 

 Lesaka 
also 
requires 
that 
employees 
disclose 
to 
Human 
Resources 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
intimate, 
romantic 
or 
 sexual 
relationship 
between 
employees 
where 
there 
exists 
a 
direct 
chain 
of 
command 
and/ 
or 
supervisor/ 
 subordinate relationship. Decisions concerning such employees will be made on a case-by-case basis by Human 
 Resources. 

 7.2.
 
RESTRICTIONS ON FORMER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 

 Former U.S. 
Government employees 
or U.S. 
military officers 
are generally 
prohibited from 
representing Lesaka 
 in matters in which the government has substantial 
interest and where the employee had prior responsibility. 

 Retired senior 
U.S. Government 
officials 
and regular 
military officers 
are further 
restricted from 
selling to, 
or in 
 some instances, contacting their former agency or military 
service. 

 The duration of 
these prohibitions and the 
matters to which they 
apply depend on the 
type of previous government 
 employment. Lesaka s legal department should be 
contacted to help identify which restrictions apply.

may 
provide 
advice 
or

identified with

activities, unless this identification has 
been specifically authorized in advance 
 by Lesaka.
