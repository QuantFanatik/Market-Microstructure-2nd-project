 PART I Item 1. Business. Introduction We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, CEMAC Sponsor LP, is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector (other than as set forth herein), we are focusing our search on high-growth companies operating in select emerging markets (excluding China), with the ability to replicate their business models sustainably across other emerging markets or translate their products, services or technologies to developed markets. Sectors of particular interest include consumer and consumer technology, financial and business services, healthcare, and technology, media and telecom. Our Management Team has deep investment and operational experience in these sectors. We will not pursue or consummate an Initial Business Combination with a target (i) whose business activities can be shown to be supporting and facilitating the Sudanese government in its continuing sponsorship of genocidal actions and human rights violations in Darfur and/or is scrutinized by the EIRIS Conflict Risk Network in its Sudan Company Report, (ii) that manufactures tobacco products, in each case at the time of our Initial Business Combination or (iii) that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have over 60 years of combined experience, including investment origination and diligence, and investment and operating management, of private and public corporations across global emerging markets. Our Chief Executive Officer, Roberta Brzezinski, is a World Bank Group alumnae and prominent emerging markets private equity investor, with investment experience in Asia, Central Europe and Latin America. Over the past 23 years, Ms. Brzezinski has acted in a principal capacity or had executive responsibility for over 5 billion in assets under management across 44 distinct private equity investments in emerging markets companies and funds, with a return on capital, from the day of investment to the exit date, of 2.6x (on average) on exited private equity investments. These investments include, among others, Coway and JD.com (Asia), Masterlease (Central Europe) and Sura Asset Management (Latin America). Our Chief Financial Officer, Herman G. Kotz , is the former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of a Nasdaq-listed company. These individuals are supported by our independent directors and Advisory Committee, each comprised of individuals with deep emerging markets experience. We have reviewed and, if the Lexasure Business Combination is not consummated, may continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an Initial Business Combination. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act, because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. Initial Public Offering The IPO Registration Statement was declared effective on November 30, 2021 (the Effective Date ). On December 3, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 20,000,000 Units. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 200,000,000. The underwriters had a 45-day option from the Effective Date to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 3, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 3,000,000 Over Allotment Units, generating additional gross proceeds of 30,000,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A Ordinary Share, par value 0.0001 per share and one-half of one Public Warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for 11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private sale of an aggregate of 10,500,000 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of 10,500,000 in the Private Placement. Also, in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor purchased an additional 1,200,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of 1,200,000. Following the closing of the IPO on December 3, 2021, 234,600,000 10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement was deposited into the Trust Account with Continental acting as trustee, which has been invested in (x) U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or (y) money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7

 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an Initial Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account. As of March 31, 2023, there was 240,442,010 in securities held in the Trust Account, which includes interest income of 5,825,601. As of March 31, 2023, 90,283 of cash was held outside the Trust Account, available for working capital needs. We are a Cayman Islands exempted company and are presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. It is the job of our Sponsor and Management Team to complete our Initial Business Combination. We must complete our Initial Business Combination by March 3, 2024, 27 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. If our Initial Business Combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account. Our Forward Purchase Agreement and Committed Capital We entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement, as amended, with the Forward Purchase Investor pursuant to which the Forward Purchase Investor, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, may, at the sole written election of the Forward Purchase Investor, purchase up to 20.0 million Forward Purchase Units, for 10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our Initial Business Combination. One Forward Purchase Unit consists of one Forward Purchase Share and one-half of one Forward Purchase Warrant. The Forward Purchase Investor has agreed that it, and any of its subsidiaries or affiliates will not redeem any Class A Ordinary Shares held by any of them in connection with the Initial Business Combination. Each whole Forward Purchase Warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share at 11.50 per share. The Forward Purchase Warrants will have the same terms as the Public Warrants and the Forward Purchase Shares will be identical to the Class A Ordinary Shares included in the Units sold in the IPO, except the Forward Purchase Shares will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights. The purchase of the Forward Purchase Units may be made regardless of whether any of our Class A Ordinary Shares are redeemed by our Public Shareholders and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our Initial Business Combination. The proceeds from the sale of Forward Purchase Units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our Initial Business Combination, expenses in connection with our Initial Business Combination and for working capital in the post-transaction company. Extension of Our Combination Period We initially had until March 3, 2023 to consummate our Initial Business Combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we signed a definitive agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination within such 15-month period. Upon the execution of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement, we received such automatic three-month extension of the time to consummate an Initial Business Combination until June 3, 2023. On May 23, 2023, we held the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting at which our shareholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which we must consummate an Initial Business Combination to March 3, 2024, and to permit our Board, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up our operations on an earlier date than March 3, 2024. In connection with the vote to approve the Extension, the holders of 18,751,603 Class A Ordinary Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.51 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 197,192,733.57, in connection with the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting. As a result of the approvals at the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting, we will deposit 50,000 per month, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an Initial Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of 450,000. On June 6, 2023 and July 3, 2023, respectively, the first two payments of 50,000 were deposited into the Trust Account pursuant to this deposit structure. However, if we have not completed our Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us (less taxes payable and up to 100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.

 Extension Non-Redemption Agreements On May 15, 2023, May 18, 2023 and May 22, 2023, we entered into the Extension Non-Redemption Agreements with the Sponsor and the NRA Holders in exchange for the NRA Holders agreeing either not to request redemption, or to reverse any previously submitted redemption demand with respect to an aggregate of 4,399,737 Class A Ordinary Shares sold in our Initial Public Offering in connection with the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting. In consideration of the foregoing agreement, immediately prior to, and substantially concurrently with, the closing of an Initial Business Combination, (i) the Sponsor (or its designees) will surrender and forfeit to us, for no consideration, an aggregate of 1,099,935 NRA Forfeited Shares and (ii) we shall issue to the NRA Holders a number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the NRA Forfeited Shares. The Extension Non-Redemption Agreements were not expected to increase the likelihood our shareholders approved the proposals put forth at the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting, but rather were effected to increase the amount of funds that remain in the Trust Account following the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting.

 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination General We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination, using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement, the sale of the Forward Purchase Securities, our shares (other backstop agreements we may enter into), securities, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. If our Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination, is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or the redemption of our Public Shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction Company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. While we could pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector (other than as set forth herein), we focused our search on high-growth companies operating in select emerging markets, with the ability to replicate their business models sustainably across other emerging markets or translate their products, services or technologies to developed markets. Although our Management assesses the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, such as Lexasure, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we have targeted and may continue to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by Public Shareholder, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination, funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our Initial Business Combination, including pursuant to private placement agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into. At this time, other than the Forward Purchase Agreement providing, as amended, for certain Forward Purchase Units to be purchased at the sole option of the Forward Purchase Investor in a private placement to occur substantially concurrently with the closing of our Initial Business Combination, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of the Sponsor or our executive officers, directors or shareholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our Initial Business Combination. We will not pursue or consummate an Initial Business Combination with a target (i) whose business activities can be shown to be supporting and facilitating the Sudanese government in its continuing sponsorship of genocidal actions and human rights violations in Darfur and/or is scrutinized by the EIRIS Conflict Risk Network in its Sudan Company Report, (ii) that manufactures tobacco products, in each case at the time of our Initial Business Combination or (iii) that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Lexasure does not fall under any of these categories. For more information on the Lexasure Business Combination and the financing arrangements associated therewith, please see Lexasure Business Combination above. Sources of Target Businesses Target business candidates have been and may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, private investment funds and other members of the technology community. Target businesses have been and may continue to be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the IPO Prospectus and this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting.

In addition, we received and may continue to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our executive officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our Management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our Management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing executive officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the Company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or members of our Management Team, or completing such Initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor or members of our Management Team. While Lexasure is not affiliated with our Sponsor, any of our executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Lexasure Business Combination and we seek to complete an Initial Business Combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor or members of our Management Team, we, or a committee of our independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that such Initial Business Combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination In evaluating a prospective target business, including Lexasure, we conduct a due diligence review that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, clinical, scientific, IP, legal and other information that are made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Initial Business Combination transaction. Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our Board of Directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the FINRA, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our Board of Directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis of our Management and Board of Directors, we have determined that the fair market value of Lexasure was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds in the Trust Account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target Management Team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Initial Business Combination. For example, we 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80 of net assets test described above. If the Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our Management Team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Acquisition Criteria Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that have been important in evaluating prospective targets for our Initial Business Combination, including Lexasure. We have leveraged these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the Lexasure Business Combination, but we may decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target that meets some, but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We seek target businesses with the following characteristics: Positive top-line growth and profitability and/or experiencing secular tailwinds. Strong or leading market positions. Opportunities for growth and scale across countries and regions. Consistent operating performance. Best-in-class governance and structuring with a high degree of transparency. Defensible and established business models with sustainable competitive advantage. Multi-pronged growth strategy to capture large addressable market. At-scale with track records of execution supporting an initial public offering. Not reliant on financial leverage to generate returns. Poised to benefit from Capitalworks industry network, operational expertise and financing experience. High barriers to entry. Capable and passionate management teams. Attractive risk-return profile and compelling value proposition. 
 We currently believe that there continues to be more than one hundred companies that meet our acquisition criteria. These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant, although we will not pursue or consummate an Initial Business Combination with a target that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). In the event that we decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business meets some but not all of the above criteria in our shareholder communications

 related to our Initial Business Combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC, such as the Lexasure Registration Statement. Acquisition Process In evaluating a prospective target business, including Lexasure, we have conducted rigorous due diligence reviews of issues that we deem important to validating a company s business quality and assessing growth and value creation opportunities, allowing our Management Team to price returns relative to potential risks appropriately. These reviews encompass, among other things, research related to the company s industry, markets, products, services and competitors, meetings with incumbent management and employees, on-site visits and a review of financial and other information that have been made available to us. Our approach to the acquisition process has been centered around leveraging the existing network and knowledge base of Capitalworks, across its integrated platform and our Management Team s operational and capital allocation expertise to target high-quality, established and scalable businesses where we see multiple opportunities for continued organic and strategic growth. Past experience or performance of Capitalworks, members of our Management Team or their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our Initial Business Combination and execute a transaction, such as the Lexasure Business Combination; or (2) success with respect to any Initial Business Combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of Capitalworks, members of our Management Team or their respective affiliates as indicative of our future performance of an investment in our Company or the returns our Company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. Lack of Business Diversification For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination, and cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
 Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of Lexasure, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the Lexasure Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other Initial Business Combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our Management Team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our Management Team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination in which Roberta Brzezinkski will serve as a director of Pubco post-Closing, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our Management Team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case in the Lexasure Business Combination as currently contemplated), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.

 Under Nasdaq s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our Initial Business Combination if, for example: We issue Ordinary Shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of our Ordinary Shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering); Any of our directors, executive officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of Ordinary Shares could result in an increase in outstanding Ordinary Shares or voting power of 5 or more; or The issuance or potential issuance of Ordinary Shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
 The Companies Act and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination. Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities If we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may purchase shares or Public Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a Public Shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our Initial Business Combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire Public Shares, vote their Public Shares in favor of our Initial Business Combination or not redeem their Public Shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or Public Warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their respective affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from Public Shareholder who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our Initial Business Combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our Initial Business Combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. The purpose of any such transaction could be to vote such shares in favor of the Initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Public Warrants could be to reduce the number of Public Warrants outstanding or to vote such Public Warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A Ordinary Shares or Public Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors and/or their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A Ordinary Shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their respective affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Initial Business Combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 a proxy with respect to our Initial Business Combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See Lexasure Business Combination above for more information on the requisite approvals needed for the Lexasure Business Combination. Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination We will provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A Ordinary Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. As of March 31, 2023, the amount in the Trust Account was approximately 10.45 per Public Share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor and each member of our Management Team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. See Lexasure Business Combination above for more information on the redemption process and specifics for the Lexasure Business Combination. Limitations on Redemptions Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of deferred underwriters commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A Ordinary Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A Ordinary Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. Manner of Conducting Redemptions We will provide our Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A Ordinary Shares upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding Ordinary Shares or seek to amend our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association would require shareholder approval. If we structure an Initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed Initial Business Combination. We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.

 If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association: conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
 Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, we will not redeem any Public Shares unless our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If Public Shareholder tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association: conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and file proxy materials with the SEC. 
 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our Public Shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if it is approved by Ordinary Resolution. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of the outstanding shares the Company representing one-half (1/2) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Initial Shareholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our Initial Shareholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our Initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding Ordinary Shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our Initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Forward Purchase Agreement, the Forward Purchase Investor has agreed that it shall vote any shares purchased during or after the IPO, in favor of our Initial Business Combination. As a result of the aggregate redemptions of Public Shares in connection with the Extension and the number of outstanding Founder Shares held by our Initial Shareholders, unless otherwise required under applicable law, we will not require the vote of the holders of any of the Public Shares sold in our Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an Initial Business Combination in order to have our Initial Business Combination approved. These quorums and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Initial Shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of deferred underwriters commissions (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination.

 However, the proposed Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A Ordinary Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A Ordinary Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. We intend to require our Public Shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to, at the holder s option, either deliver their share certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the Initial Business Combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a Public Shareholder seeking redemption of its Public Shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring Public Shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming Public Shareholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed Initial Business Combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by Public Shareholders who elected to redeem their shares. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately 100 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on a business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our Public Shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates (if any) delivered by Public Shareholders who elected to redeem their shares.

 If the Lexasure Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an Initial Business Combination with a different target until March 3, 2024, 27 months from the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Extension. Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that we will have only 27 months from the closing of the IPO to complete our Initial Business Combination, pursuant to the Extension. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, such as Lexasure, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our Public Shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination. Employees We currently have two executive officers and a junior staffer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. Available Information We have registered our Units, Class A Ordinary Shares and Public Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business, such as the Lexasure Registration Statement. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or the International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of

 their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following December 3, 2026, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Ordinary Shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior September 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 250 million as of the end of the prior September 30, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeds 700 million as of the prior September 30. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (1) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (2) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: we are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our Initial Business Combination in the prescribed time frame, including the Lexasure Business Combination; our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business, such as Lexasure, or businesses may not be realized;

 we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our Initial Business Combination; our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our Initial Business Combination; we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our Initial Business Combination, including the Lexasure Business Combination, or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our Initial Business Combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the Initial Business Combination; Trust Account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; our financial performance following an Initial Business Combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack of an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an Initial Business Combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our Initial Business Combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target; changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an Initial Business Combination; in the event that the Lexasure Business Combination is not completed and we seek alternative targets, we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability; we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an Initial Business Combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the Trust Account only upon completion of an Initial Business Combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the Initial Public Offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an Initial Business Combination; we may attempt to complete our Initial Business Combination with a private company, such as Lexasure, about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all; our Warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Ordinary Shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an Initial Business Combination; since our Initial Shareholders will lose their entire investment in us if our Initial Business Combination is not completed (other than with respect to any Public Shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering), and because our Sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our Public Shareholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our Initial Business Combination;

 changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our Initial Business Combination, and results of operations; the value of the Founder Shares following completion of our Initial Business Combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our Class A Ordinary Shares at such time is substantially less than 10.20 per share; resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, our Public Shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our Warrants will expire worthless; in March 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our Initial Business Combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an Initial Business Combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the Trust Account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an Initial Business Combination and instead liquidate the Company; to mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we expect that we will, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of our IPO Registration Statement, instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our Initial Business Combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the Trust Account, we would likely receive less interest on the funds held in the Trust Account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our Public Shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; we may not be able to complete an Initial Business Combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an Initial Business Combination; military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an Initial Business Combination; there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Market conditions, economic uncertainty or downturns could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination. In recent years, the United States and other markets have experienced cyclical or episodic downturns, and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, the Ukraine-Russia conflict, instability in the U.S. and global banking systems, rising fuel prices, increasing interest rates or foreign exchange rates and high inflation

 and the possibility of a recession. A significant downturn in economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to consummate an Initial Business Combination. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any future economic slowdown or any subsequent recovery generally, or in any industry. If the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination could be adversely affected. For example, in January 2023, the outstanding national debt of the U.S. government reached its statutory limit. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury Department has announced that, since then, it has been using extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. government s default on its payment obligations, and to extend the time that the U.S. government has to raise its statutory debt limit or otherwise resolve its funding situation. The failure by Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling could have severe repercussions within the U.S. and to global credit and financial markets. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its payment obligations, or experience delays in making payments when due. A payment default or delay by the U.S. government, or continued uncertainty surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling, could result in a variety of adverse effects for financial markets, market participants and U.S. and global economic conditions. In addition, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility a downgrade in the credit rating of the U.S. government and could result in economic slowdowns or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States as a result of disputes over the debt ceiling. The impact of a potential downgrade to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect economic conditions, as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination. If our Initial Business Combination involves a company organized under the laws of a state of the United States, it is possible a 1 U.S. federal excise tax will be imposed on us in connection with redemptions of our common stock after or in connection with such Initial Business Combination. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 became law in the United States, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of certain repurchases (including certain redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., United States) corporations (and certain non-U.S. corporations treated as surrogate foreign corporations ). The excise tax will apply to stock repurchases occurring in 2023 and beyond. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares of stock repurchased at the time of the repurchase. The Treasury Department has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax; however, only limited guidance has been issued to date. As an entity incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, the 1 excise tax is not expected to apply to redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares (absent any regulations and other additional guidance that may be issued in the future with retroactive effect) in connection with the Lexasure Business Combination. However, in connection with an Initial Business Combination other than the Lexasure Business Combination involving a company organized under the laws of the United States, it is possible that we domesticate and continue as a Delaware corporation prior to certain redemptions and, because our securities are trading on Nasdaq, it is possible that we will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection with the Initial Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the Treasury Department, redemptions in complete liquidation of the company). In all cases, the extent of the excise tax that may be incurred will depend on a number of factors, including the fair market value of our stock redeemed, the extent such redemptions could be treated as dividends and not repurchases, and the content of any regulations and other additional guidance from the Treasury Department that may be issued and applicable to the redemptions. Issuances of stock by a repurchasing corporation in a year in which such corporation repurchases stock may reduce the amount of excise tax imposed with respect to such repurchase. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the shareholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax as a result of redemptions in connection with the Initial Business Combination could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to pay redemptions or reduce the cash contribution to the target business in connection with our Initial Business Combination, which could cause the other shareholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such excise tax.

 Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects. The funds in our operating account and our Trust Account are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest bearing and interest-bearing accounts would exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. Should events, including limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, our liquidity may be adversely affected. For example, on March 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Although we did not have any funds in Silicon Valley Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience similar issues. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us in connection with a potential Initial Business Combination, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. For the complete list of risks relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our IPO Registration Statement, (ii) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on July 15, 2022, (iii) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC on November 14, 2022 and (iv) Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A as filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. For risks related to Lexasure and the Lexasure Business Combination, please see the Lexasure Registration Statement once filed. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. Our executive offices are located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 11 th Floor, New York, New York , 10105, and our telephone number is (202) 320-4822. The cost for our use of this space is included in the 20,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, administrative and shared personnel support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. To the knowledge of our Management Team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, CEMAC Sponsor LP, is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. Lexasure Business Combination On March 1, 2023, we entered the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement with Lexasure, Pubco, the Merger Subs, the SPAC Representative, and the Seller Representative, for the Lexasure Business Combination. Pursuant to the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement, Pubco will serve as the parent company of each of the Company and Lexasure following the consummation of the Lexasure Business Combination. For a full description of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement and the proposed Lexasure Business Combination, including the ancillary agreements entered into in connection with the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement, please see Item 1. Business. Recent Developments On April 19, 2023, pursuant to the Financial Side Letter, Lexasure agreed to loan us the Lexasure Loan up to a maximum of 600,000. The Lexasure Loan is unsecured and interest free. In connection with the Lexasure Loan, at the closing of the Lexasure Business Combination (or in the event of an Alternative Closing), the Sponsor has agreed to transfer a number of Ordinary Shares to Lexasure or its designee equal to (x) the amount of the Lexasure Loan that is used by us and not returned to Lexasure at or prior to the closing of the Lexasure Business Combination or Alternative Closing (less any amounts applied pursuant to the termination fee provision of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement), divided by (y) 10.00 per share. We will repay the Lexasure Loan amount directly to Lexasure at the closing of the Lexasure Business Combination, and in the event of the termination of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement for any reason, the Lexasure Loan shall be cancelled and no amounts shall be owed by us, provided that any amounts advanced by Lexasure pursuant to the Financials Side Letter shall reduce the amounts payable by Lexasure pursuant to the termination fee provision of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement. On May 15, 2023, May 18, 2023 and May 22, 2023, we entered into the Extension Non-Redemption Agreements with the Sponsor and the NRA Holders in exchange for the NRA Holders agreeing either not to request redemption, or to reverse any previously submitted redemption demand with respect to an aggregate of 4,399,737 Class A Ordinary Shares sold in our Initial Public Offering in connection with the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting. In consideration of the foregoing agreement, immediately prior to, and substantially concurrently with, the closing of an Initial Business Combination, (i) the Sponsor (or its designees) will surrender and forfeit to us, for no consideration, an aggregate of 1,099,935 NRA Forfeited Shares and (ii) we shall issue to the NRA Holders a number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the NRA Forfeited Shares. On May 23, 2023, we held the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting at which our shareholders approved, among other things, an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which we must consummate an Initial Business Combination to March 3, 2024, and to permit our Board, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up our operations on an earlier date than March 3, 2024. In connection with the vote to approve the Extension, the holders of 18,751,603 Class A Ordinary Shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.51 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 197,192,733.57, in connection with the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting. As a result of the approvals at the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting, we will deposit 50,000 per month, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an Initial Business Combination, for up to an aggregate of 450,000. On June 6, 2023 and July 3, 2023, respectively, the first two payments of 50,000 were deposited into the Trust Account pursuant to this deposit structure.

 On May 23, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 5,749,999 Class A Ordinary Shares to the Sponsor, upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor in the Founder Conversion. The 5,749,999 Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the Founder Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B Ordinary Shares before the Founder Conversion, including, among others, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an Initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Prospectus. Following the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the Extension, there were 9,998,396 Class A Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and one Class B Ordinary Share issued and outstanding. As a result of the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the Extension, the Sponsor held 57.5 of the outstanding Ordinary Shares as of July 14, 2023. For more information on the extension of our Combination Period and the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting, including the Extension Non-Redemption Agreements and the Founder Conversion, please see Item 1. Business . Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an Initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an Initial Business Combination; however, Management continues to evaluate the impact of these factors. The financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Results of Operations As of March 31, 2023, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2023 relates to our formation and the IPO and, subsequent to the closing of the IPO, identifying a target company for an Initial Business Combination and costs related to the Lexasure Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO. We incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence and transaction expenses. For the year ended March 31, 2023, we had net income of 4,970,671, which consisted primarily of formation and operating costs amounting to 2,280,815, and administrative fees of 240,000 offset by interest income earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to 5,825,601, and change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability and the forward purchase agreement liability of 2,259,680 and (593,795), respectively. For the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022, we had net income of 19,258,401, which consisted primarily of formation and operating costs amounting to 334,046, administrative fees of 80,000 and transaction costs allocable to derivative liabilities amounting to 799,766 offset by interest income earned on cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account amounting to 16,409, and change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability and the forward purchase agreement liability of 20,530,500 and (74,696), respectively. We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern As of March 31, 2023, we had 90,283 in cash and a working capital deficit of 1.2 million.

 In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an Initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans as may be required. Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The Working Capital Loans may be repaid upon completion of an Initial Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted upon completion of an Initial Business Combination into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that an Initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. On February 1, 2023, we executed the WCL Agreement, a Working Capital Loan pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan us funds up to 1,500,000. As of March 31, 2023, we had borrowed 800,000 and had 700,000 available to us under the WCL Agreement. For the year ended March 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 1,703,978, which was due to non-cash adjustments to net income related to the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability of 2,259,680 and interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of 5,825,601, partially offset by net income of 4,970,671 and non-cash adjustment to net income related to the change in fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement liability of 593,795 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 816,837. For the period April 20, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 759,024, which was due to non-cash adjustments to net income related to the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability of 20,530,500 and interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of 16,409, partially offset by net income of 19,258,401 and non-cash adjustment to net income related to the change in fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement liability of 74,696 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 344,978. For the period April 20, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 234,600,000, which was due to cash deposited into the Trust Account of 234,600,000. For the year ended March 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 825,000, which was due to 800,000 in proceeds from the WCL Agreement and 25,000 in related party advances. For the period April 20, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 236,328,285, which was due to proceeds from sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering of 225,400,000, proceeds from sale of the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement of 11,700,000, and proceeds from the IPO Promissory Note of 280,000, partially offset by payments on IPO Promissory Note of 280,000, repayment of related party advances of 25,000 and payment of offering costs of 746,715. Based on the foregoing, it is possible that the 90,283 in cash held outside the Trust Account on March 31, 2023 might not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least 12 months from the date of this Report, assuming that an Initial Business Combination is not consummated during that time. Until consummation of the Initial Business Combination, we have used and may continue to use these funds to pay existing accounts payable, identify and evaluate prospective Initial Business Combination candidates, perform due diligence on prospective target businesses, pay for travel expenditures, select the target business to merge with or acquire, and structure, negotiate and consummate the Initial Business Combination. We can raise additional capital through Working Capital Loans from the Sponsor, or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, or through loans from third parties. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of these financial statements. Contractual Obligations General and Administrative Services Commencing on the date the Units were first listed on Nasdaq, we agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we incurred and paid 240,000 and 80,000 of expenses.

 Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans or an extension loan (and any shares of Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or Warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans or an extension loan and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Founder Shares Registration Rights Agreement, which requires us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A Ordinary Shares). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of an Initial Business Combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the Founder Shares Registration Rights Agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement We granted the underwriters of the IPO a 45-day option from the date of IPO to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 3, 2021, the underwriters purchased an additional 3,000,000 Units pursuant to the exercise of their over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to us of 30,000,000. The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 4,600,000, upon the closing of the IPO. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 0.35 per Unit, or 8,050,000. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an Initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Consulting Agreements On November 27, 2022, we entered into an agreement with a transactional and strategic advisory firm (the First Strategic Advisor for advisory services in connection with a potential Initial Business Combination. Pursuant to this agreement, we, if we consummate an Initial Business Combination, shall pay the First Strategic Advisor, at the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, a cash fee (the Capital Markets Advisory Fee in the amount equal to (i) 1,500,000 plus (ii) an Incremental Advisory Fee based on the value of the proceeds held in the Trust Account immediately prior to the closing of the Initial Business Combination (the Trust Proceeds ). If the Trust Proceeds are: (i) greater than 58,650,000 but less than or equal to 117,300,000, we will pay the First Strategic Advisor an Incremental Advisory Fee of 250,000; (ii) greater than 117,300,000 but less than or equal to 175,950,000, we will pay the First Strategic Advisor an Incremental Advisory Fee of 1,000,000; or (iii) greater than 175,950,000, we will pay the First Strategic Advisor an Incremental Advisory Fee of 2,500,000. The Capital Markets Advisory Fee shall be due and payable to the First Strategic Advisor by us at the consummation of the Initial Business Combination. If the Initial Business Combination does not occur or is abandoned, the First Strategic Advisor will not be entitled to the Capital Markets Advisory Fee. We will also reimburse the First Strategic Advisor for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the consulting agreement, provided that such expenses will not exceed 25,000 in the aggregate without our prior written approval. On February 1, 2023, we entered into a separate agreement with another transactional and strategic advisory firm (the Second Strategic Advisor to provide consulting, advisory and related services in connection with a potential Initial Business Combination. Upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the Second Strategic Advisor will purchase from us 250,000 Class B Ordinary Shares at a purchase price of 0.04 per share or 10,000 in aggregate. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies This Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, is based on the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following as its critical accounting policies: Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption All of the Class A Ordinary Share sold as part of the Units in the IPO contain a redemption feature that allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with our liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. In accordance with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC Topic 480-10-S99 Accounting for Redeemable Equity Instruments ASC 480-10-S99 ), redemption provisions not solely within our control require Ordinary Shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. The Class A Ordinary Shares are subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, we have the option to either accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, we recognized the remeasurement from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Ordinary Shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. Net Income Per Ordinary Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Our statement of operations includes a presentation of income per share for Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income per share. The remeasurement associated with the redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares is excluded from net loss per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value. We have not considered the effect of the Public Warrants or the Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 23,200,000 of our Class A Ordinary Shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, since their exercise is contingent upon future events. Net income per share, basic and diluted, for Class A and Class B non-redeemable Ordinary Shares is calculated by dividing the net income, adjusted for income or loss attributable to Class A redeemable Ordinary Shares, by the weighted average number of Class A and Class B non-redeemable Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Class A and Class B non-redeemable Ordinary Shares includes the Founder Shares as these shares do not have any redemption features and do not participate in the income or losses of the Trust Account. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into Ordinary Shares and then share in the earnings of our Company. As a result, diluted income per share is the same as basic income per share for the period presented. Warrants We account for the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants issued in connection with the IPO and the Private Placement in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging whereby under that provision, the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify the warrant instrument as a liability at fair value and adjust the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. This liability will be re-measured at each balance sheet date until the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants are exercised or expire, and any change in fair value will be recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value at issuance was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants. The valuation models utilize inputs and other assumptions and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled. Such warrant classification is also subject to re-evaluation at each reporting period. Upon issuance of the Private Warrants, we recorded a charge of 1,532,700 for the excess fair value of private warrant liabilities over the proceeds received. Forward Purchase Agreement We entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement, as amended, with the Forward Purchase Investor pursuant to which the Forward Purchase Investor, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, may, at the sole written election of the Forward Purchase Investor, purchase up to 20.0 million Forward Purchase Units, for 10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our Initial Business Combination. One Forward Purchase Unit consists of one Forward Purchase Share and one-half of one Forward Purchase Warrant. The Forward Purchase Warrants will have the same terms as the Public Warrants, and 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 the Forward Purchase Shares will be identical to the Class A Ordinary Shares included in the Units sold in the IPO, except the Forward Purchase Shares will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights. For further information on the Forward Purchase Agreement and the Forward Purchase Securities, please see Item 1. Business. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU Topic 2020 06, Debt -Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470 20) and Derivatives and Hedging --Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020 06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. ASU 2020 06 also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. We adopted ASU 2020-06 upon inception. Adoption of ASU 2020 06 did not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Reference is made to pages F-1 through F-23 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report, due to a material weakness solely related to our accounting for complex financial instruments. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements. In light of this material weakness, we have enhanced our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements including making greater use of third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. We believe our efforts will enhance our controls relating to accounting for complex financial transactions, but we can offer no assurance that our controls will not require additional review and modification in the future as industry accounting practice may evolve over time. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our Management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. In making these assessments, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, Management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals. This Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. On February 1, 2023, we executed the WCL Agreement, a Working Capital Loan from the Sponsor to loan us funds up to 1,500,000. The proceeds of the WCL Agreement will be used for costs in connection with our Initial Business Combination or as general working capital. The WCL Agreement is non-interest bearing and payable, in part or in full, on the closing of an Initial Business Combination. As of July 14, 2023, we had borrowings of 1,330,000 under the WCL Agreement. A copy of the WCL Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.10 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference. The disclosure set forth in this Item 9B is intended to be a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the WCL Agreement. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections. Not applicable.

Committees of the Board of Directors Our Board of Directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Our audit committee and compensation committee are composed solely of independent directors.

We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: assisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent registered public accounting firm s qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm and any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us; pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; reviewing and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm all relationships the firm has with us in order to evaluate their continued independence; setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (1) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues; meeting to review and discuss our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with Management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including reviewing our specific disclosures under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and reviewing with Management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the FASB, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

 Compensation Committee We established a compensation committee of our Board of Directors. Darius James Roth, Michael Faber, Neil Harper and Whitney Baker serve as the members of the compensation committee, and Michael Faber chairs the compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer s based on such evaluation; reviewing and making recommendations to our Board of Directors with respect to the compensation, and any incentive compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to Board approval of all of our other executive officers; reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans; implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; assisting Management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees; producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than payment to an affiliate of our Sponsor of 20,000 per month, until the end of the Combination Period, for administrative and support services, and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, executive officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an Initial Business Combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such Initial Business Combination. The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other advisor and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such advisor. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other advisor, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such advisor, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. Director Nominations We do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(1)(A) of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Darius James Roth, Neil Harper, Michael Faber and Whitney Baker. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, each of Darius James Roth, Neil Harper, Michael Faber and Whitney Baker is independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.

 Our Board of Directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our shareholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of shareholders (or, if applicable, an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders). Our shareholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our Board of Directors should follow the procedures set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, prior to our Initial Business Combination, holders of our Public Shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our Board of Directors. We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, our Board of Directors considers a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person s candidacy for membership on the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific Board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of Board of Directors. Code of Ethics We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our directors, executive officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as an exhibit to the IPO Registration Statement. You can review this document by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov or by visiting our website. In addition, a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors will be provided without charge upon request from us. If we make any amendments to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics other than technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or controller or persons performing similar functions requiring disclosure under applicable SEC or Nasdaq rules, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website. The information included on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only. Item 11. Executive Compensation. We entered into an agreement with the Sponsor whereby, commencing on the date our Units were first listed on Nasdaq, through the earlier of the consummation of an Initial Business Combination and our liquidation, we agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 and the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022, we incurred 240,000 and 80,000, respectively, of administrative services under this arrangement. Except as described herein, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, has been or will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an Initial Business Combination. However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Initial Business Combinations. After the completion of our Initial Business Combination, directors or members of our Management Team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed Initial Business Combination, such as the Lexasure Registration Statement. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed Initial Business Combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our Management Team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our Initial Business Combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our Management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our Management to remain with us after the consummation of our

 Initial Business Combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential Initial Business Combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the Board of Directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our Board of Directors. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our Ordinary Shares as of July 14, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of Ordinary Shares, by: each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding Ordinary Shares; each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our Ordinary Shares; and all our executive officers and directors as a group.

 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. Founder Shares On May 12, 2021, our Sponsor, paid 25,000, or approximately 0.004 per share, to cover certain of our Initial Public Offering costs in exchange for 5,750,000 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares (i) may be converted into Class A Ordinary Shares at the option of the holder at any time prior to the Initial Business Combination or (ii) will automatically convert into Class A Ordinary Shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of the Initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A Ordinary Shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the Initial Business Combination, the number of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, 20 of the total number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of Public Shares by Public Shareholders), including the total number of Class A Ordinary Shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the us in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A Ordinary Shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A Ordinary Shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the Initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, or our officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. The Sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares and any Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of the Initial Business Combination, or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after the Initial Business Combination that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property; except to certain permitted transferees and under certain circumstances (the lock-up ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) the closing price of Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Initial Business Combination or (2) if we consummate a transaction after the Initial Business Combination, which results in our shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, the Founder Shares will be released from the lock-up. On May 23, 2023, we issued an aggregate of 5,749,999 Class A Ordinary Shares to the Sponsor, upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor in the Founder Conversion. The 5,749,999 Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the Founder Conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B Ordinary Shares before the Founder Conversion, including, among others, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an Initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Prospectus. Following the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the Extension, there were 9,998,396 Class A Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and one Class B Ordinary Share issued and outstanding. As a result of the Founder Conversion and the redemptions in connection with the Extension, the Sponsor held 57.5 of the outstanding Ordinary Shares as of July 14, 2023. Private Placement Warrants The Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,700,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, or 11,700,000 in the aggregate. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at a price of 11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement was added to the proceeds from the IPO that are held in the Trust Account. If we do not complete an Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. While they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable. The Sponsor agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Private Placement Warrants (except to permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Initial Business Combination. Forward Purchase Agreement We entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement, as amended, with the Forward Purchase Investor pursuant to which the Forward Purchase Investor, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, may, at the sole written election of the Forward Purchase Investor, purchase up 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 to 20.0 million Forward Purchase Units, for 10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the closing of our Initial Business Combination. One Forward Purchase Unit consists of one Forward Purchase Share and one-half of one Forward Purchase Warrant. The Forward Purchase Warrants will have the same terms as the Public Warrants, and the Forward Purchase Shares will be identical to the Class A Ordinary Shares included in the Units sold in the IPO, except the Forward Purchase Shares will be subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration rights. For further information on the Forward Purchase Agreement and the Forward Purchase Securities, please see Item 1. Business. Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans or an extension loan (and any shares of Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or Warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans or an extension loan and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Founder Shares Registration Rights Agreement, which requires us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to Class A Ordinary Shares). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of an Initial Business Combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the Founder Shares Registration Rights Agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Related Party Loans On May 12, 2021, the Sponsor issued the IPO Promissory Note to us, an unsecured promissory note, pursuant to which, we could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. The IPO Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 or (ii) the consummation of the IPO. During the period ended March 31, 2022, the Company borrowed 280,000 pursuant to the IPO Promissory Note. As of March 31, 2022, the amounts outstanding under the IPO Promissory Note were paid in full. On February 1, 2023, we executed the WCL Agreement, a Working Capital Loan pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan us funds up to 1,500,000. As of March 31, 2023, we had borrowed 800,000 and had 700,000 available to us under the WCL Agreement. Administrative Services Agreement Commencing on the date the Units were first listed on Nasdaq, we agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we incurred and paid 240,000 and 80,000 of expenses. Lexasure Business Combination For more information on the agreements entered into in connection with the Lexasure Business Combination concerning the Sponsor, any of our officers or directors, please see Item 1. Business . Extension Non-Redemption Agreements On May 15, 2023, May 18, 2023 and May 22, 2023, we entered into the Extension Non-Redemption Agreements with the Sponsor and the NRA Holders in exchange for the NRA Holders agreeing either not to request redemption, or to reverse any previously submitted redemption demand with respect to an aggregate of 4,399,737 Class A Ordinary Shares sold in our Initial Public Offering in connection with the 2023 Extraordinary Meeting. In consideration of the foregoing agreement, immediately prior to, and substantially concurrently with, the closing of an Initial Business Combination, (i) the Sponsor (or its designees) will surrender and forfeit to us, for no consideration, an aggregate of 1,099,935 NRA Forfeited Shares and (ii) we shall issue to the NRA Holders a number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the NRA Forfeited Shares. For more information on the Extension Non-Redemption Agreements, please see Item 1. Business .

 Director Independence Nasdaq listing rules require that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board has determined that each of Michael Faber, Neil Harper, Whitney Baker and Darius James Roth is an independent director under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum, for services rendered. Audit Fees Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Marcum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC for the year ended March 31, 2023 and the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022 totaled approximately 93,134 and 93,730, respectively. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings. Audit-Related Fees Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the year ended March 31, 2023 and the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022 we did not pay Marcum any audit-related fees. Tax Fees We did not pay Marcum for tax services, planning or advice for the year ended March 31, 2023 and the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022. All Other Fees We did not pay Marcum for any other services for the year ended March 31, 2023 and the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) to March 31, 2022. Pre-Approval Policy Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our Board of Directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2023 and for the period from April 20, 2021 (inception) through March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination on or before March 3, 2024; however, the Company s cash and working capital as of March 31, 2023 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. The Company entered into a definitive business combination agreement on March 1, 2023; however, the completion of this transaction is subject to the approval of the Company s shareholders among other conditions. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals and satisfy the required closing conditions prior to March 3, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline and fund operations for a reasonable period of time after March 3, 2024 in the event that it is unable to complete a business combination by that date. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021. July 14, 2023

In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share, due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account Going Concern Consideration As of March 31, 2023, the Company had cash of and a working capital deficit of . Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU Topic 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , the Company s management has determined that these liquidity risks, as well as if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the Public Shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company s management has determined that the Company does not have funds that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until the consummation of an initial Business Combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated in the Charter. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. Risks and Uncertainties The Company s management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of the balance sheet. Additionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the above uncertainties.

The Company will also reimburse the First Strategic Advisor for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the consulting agreement, provided that such expenses will not exceed in the aggregate without the prior written approval of the Company. On February 1, 2023, the Company entered into a separate agreement with another transactional and strategic advisory firm (the Second Strategic Advisor to provide consulting, advisory and related services in connection with a potential Business Combination.

Non-Redemption Agreements The Company initially had until March 3, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination, with an automatic three-month extension if the Company signed a definitive agreement with respect to the Business Combination within such 15-month period, as described in the final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering, filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) with the SEC on December 2, 2021 (File No. 333-260513) (the IPO Prospectus ). In February 2023, prior to signing the Lexausre Business Combination Agreement, the Company prepared to hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to, among other things, seek an extension of the time it had to consummate a Business Combination (the March 2023 Meeting ). On February 27, 2023, in connection with the March 2023 Meeting, the Company and the Sponsor, entered into non-redemption agreements (the Terminated Non-Redemption Agreements with certain unaffiliated third parties in exchange for such third parties agreeing not to redeem up to an aggregate of Class A ordinary shares of the Company sold in its Initial Public Offering Non-Redeemed Shares ). In exchange for the foregoing commitments not to redeem such Non-Redeemed Shares, the Sponsor, as consideration for entering into the Terminated Non-Redemption Agreements, transferred to such third parties an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares, which will be retained by such parties under all circumstances. Upon the execution of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement, the Company received the automatic three-month extension of the time to consummate the Business Combination until June 3, 2023. Consequently, the March 2023 Meeting was postponed indefinitely and the Terminated Non-Redemption Agreements automatically terminated per the terms of such agreements. preference shares with a par value of per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board.

On May 23, 2023 the Company converted Class B ordinary shares to Class A Ordinary Shares (see note 10). Only holders of the Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of ordinary shares, including holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares, will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with its initial Business Combination, the Company may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of a Business Combination (or earlier at the option of the holders thereof), on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all the Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, of the sum of the total number of all shares of ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (net of the number of Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller of an interest in the target to us in a Business Combination. after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary share pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, following the closing of a Business Combination, with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares effective until the warrants expire or are redeemed in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary share is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not

 If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of Warrants When the Price per Class A Ordinary Share Equals or Exceeds Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants: in whole and not in part; at a price of per warrant provided that the holder will be able to exercise their warrants on cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares; upon a minimum of prior written notice of redemption; if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a - trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and if, and only if, the Private Placement Warrants are also concurrently exchanged at the same price (equal to a number of Class A ordinary shares) as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above. 
 If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.

 after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Company accounts for the warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record a derivative liability upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value and the warrants are allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability is adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations. The Company reassess the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the warrants are reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification. Upon issuance of the derivative warrants, the Company recorded a derivative liability of on the balance sheets. The proceeds received from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants exceeded the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants, and the Company recorded a charge of to the statement of operations. Liabilities: Warrant liability Private Placement Warrants 2 Warrant liability Public Warrants 1 Forward Purchase Agreement liability 2 The Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets. The warrant liabilities and Forward Purchase Agreement liability are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statement of operations. Upon initial issuance, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Public Warrants and a modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement liability. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of Units (which is inclusive of Class A ordinary share and one-half of one Public Warrant), (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, (iii) the sale of the Forward Purchase Agreement and (iv) the issuance of Class B ordinary shares, first to the warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (temporary equity) and Class B ordinary shares (permanent equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date. Upon initial issuance, the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants and the Forward Purchase Agreement were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at the measurement dates due to the use of unobservable inputs. Inherent in pricing models are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life and risk-free interest rate. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs.

Upon issuance of the Private Placement Warrants, the Company recorded a loss of for the excess fair value of the derivative warrants over the proceeds received from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants which is included in the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities on the accompanying statements of operations. The Forward Purchase Agreement is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. At initial measurement, the Forward Purchase Agreement was valued using a Modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement was the expected volatility of the ordinary shares. Due to the attributes of the Forward Purchase Agreement, at March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Forward Purchase Agreement was valued using the Public Warrants publicly listed trading price and considered to be a Level 2 fair value measurement. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Forward Purchase Agreement liability was and respectively.

The Company will repay the Lexasure Loan amount directly to Lexasure at the closing of the Lexasure Business Combination, and in the event of the termination of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement for any reason, the Lexasure Loan shall be cancelled and no amounts shall be owed by the Company, provided that any amounts advanced by Lexasure pursuant to the Financials Side Letter shall reduce the amounts payable by Lexasure pursuant to the termination fee provision of the Lexasure Business Combination Agreement.
