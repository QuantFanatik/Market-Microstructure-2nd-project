NOTE
ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms Achison, company, we, us, 
and our in this document refer to Achison Inc, a New York corporation.

On
July 1, 2019 Lansdale Inc, the principal stockholder of the Company Seller and controlled by the Company s prior
President, Mr. Wanjun Xie, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Dazhong 368 Inc, (the Buyer ),

shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company of record and beneficially by Seller. The Purchased Shares represented approximately 90 
of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, resulting in a change of the control of the Company. Mr.

3 

Prior
to the change of the management team, the Company was engaging in holding or trading securities in the US market, trading spot silver
in Singapore s market as well as to trade whisky in the UK market. The Company has changed its focus to operate online advertising
business through www.dazhong368.com (the Website in the New York area. 

The
Website was established by Mr. Zhang in 2014 which is mainly focused on customers in the Greater New York area. The Website advertises
different markets for professional individuals or companies including real estate, services, accounting, legal and so forth. We charge
certain fees from these advertisements posted on our Website. The Company expects to generate revenue from the online advertising business
and we also seek other profitable business at the same time. 

On
April 10, 2023, Mr. Barry
Wan acquired control of 29,215,000 restricted shares of common stock (the Purchased Shares of
Achison Inc. (the Company , us , we or our ), representing approximately 97 of
the Company s total issued and outstanding common stock (the Common Stock from Dazhong 368 Inc and Sophia 33 Inc,

to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Wan paid an aggregate purchase price of four hundred thousand dollars 400,000.00) to Mr. Zhang

97 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock. Both before and after the transactions, the Company had 29,995,000 shares of its
common stock outstanding. 

In
connection with the transaction, on April 10, 2023, Mr. Dingshan Zhang resigned from all positions he held with the Company. On April
10, 2023, Ms. Jing Wan was appointed by our majority shareholder as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and

Products
and Services 

Our
current services will focus on the website development, maintenance and online business advertisement. Meanwhile, we will also search
for different business opportunities to be acquired by the Company. 

We
will continue to improve our online platform in order to expand our customer base. The potential customer resource of our online advertising
platform will be mainly from professional individuals and small companies that will use our platform to promote their services or products
to their end-users. 

Strategy 

Our
strategy is to target the small to medium-sized companies as well as the professional individuals that will use our Website to promote
their products or services. Except to build up a customized ID card introduction for each of our customers, we will also help our customers
to maintain their content information posted under their ID card introduction. We hope this one-stop service will better serve our potential
customers. 

Competitive
Conditions 

The
online advertising industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change and intense marketing
by providers with similar products and services. 

A
few of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating
histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have. As a result, certain of these competitors
may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies that could hinder our ability to market our services. We believe that our key competitive
advantages are our ability to deliver reliable, high quality service in a cost-effective manner. We cannot provide assurances, however,
that these advantages will enable us to succeed against comparable service offerings from our competitors

Market
Information 

There
has only been limited trading for the Company s Class A common stock since it began trading on October 19, 2021. There is no assurance
that an active trading market will ever develop or, if such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to the Company,
as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve
a person s account for transactions in penny stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement
to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (i) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives
of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person
has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has
to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may
affect the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock
in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of
our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

On
June 3, 2021, our Class A common stock was listed for quotation on the OTC Markets under the symbol ACHN . The OTC Markets
is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over-the-counter equity
securities. The OTC Markets securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is
limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common
stock. 

On
June 09, 2023, the closing price of our Class A common stock reported on the OTC Markets was 0.85 per share. The following table sets
forth, for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported on the OTC Markets.

pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the parties thereto (the Stock Purchase Agreement ). Pursuant
to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Wan paid an aggregate purchase price of four hundred thousand dollars 400,000.00) to Mr. Zhang

97 of the Company s outstanding Common Stock. Both before and after the transactions, the Company had 29,995,000 shares of its
common stock outstanding. 

In
connection with the transaction, on April 10, 2023, Mr. Dingshan Zhang resigned from all positions he held with the Company. On April
10, 2023, Ms. Jing Wan was appointed by our majority shareholder as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and
Director, and then resigned on June 16, 2023. On June 16, 2023, Mr. Barry Wan was
appointed by our board as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and a Director. The Company plans to continue its existing operations through its website at www.dazhong368.com , which, since 2014,
has provided online advertising to different individuals or companies operating in real estate, accounting, legal and other professional
services in the New York City area. Its revenues are generated from advertising fees. 

As of June 14, 2023, Antiaging Quantum Living Inc. became the new name
for the Company. 

Results
of Operation for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 

During
the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated revenue in the amount of 13,600 and 7,400, respectively. The increase
was mainly due to our online advertising business formally launched in the second half of year 2020. During the years ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, the Company incurred operating expenses of 50,230 and 51,310, respectively. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease
in professional fees. For the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was 36,630 and 43,436, respectively. The decrease in
net loss was mainly due to the increase in revenue for the years ended March 31, 2023 compared to 2022. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 276,332. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash of 354 and negative working capital
of 86,647, compared to cash of 14,269 and a negative working capital of 50,331 on March 31, 2022. The decrease in the working capital
was primarily due to cash used to pay for operating expenses. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations and execute the business plan of the Company
in order to meet its operating needs on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be
sufficient to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.
These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding
the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions included in footnote 2 of our financial statements is critical to an understanding
of our financial statements.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Antiaging Quantum Living Inc (FKA: Achison Inc) (the Company as
of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operation, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then
ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a net capital deficiency, and has stated
that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation of the
events and conditions and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this
matter. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the board of directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies

In
assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment,
management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets for every period because it is more likely
than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Not
Applicable. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were material weakness in
our internal controls over Financial reporting as of March 31, 2023 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
The material weakness in our controls and procedure were lack of US GAAP knowledge and segregation duties. Management does not believe
that any of these material weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in view of this
discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance
with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii)
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control
- Integrated Framework that was issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended
March 31, 2023. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows material weaknesses and are not effective.
We have identified material weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial
reporting under current operations.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Subsequent
to the end of the period covered by this report, and in light of the weakness described above, management is in the process of designing
and implementing improvements in its internal control over financial reporting and we currently plan to hire an independent third-party
consultant to assist in identifying and determining the appropriate accounting procedures and controls to implement.

consists of Jing Wang, handles the functions that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. We do not currently have the capital
resources to pay director fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing
to act as an audit committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board of directors, we expect
that we will seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining any such expert our board
would make a determination as to whether such person is independent.
