Overall Business Strategies 
 
 Our core business is and historically has been in the semiconductor industry, including manufacturing of test equipment Manufacturing ), testing services Testing and distribution of test and other semiconductor equipment and electronic components Distribution ). Revenue from the semiconductor industry accounted for 99.9 of our total revenue for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The semiconductor industry has experienced periods of rapid growth, but has also experienced downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and decline in general economic conditions. To reduce our risks associated with sole industry focus and customer concentration, we continue to put effort into expanding its line of businesses. 
 
 To achieve our strategic plan for our semiconductor business, we believe that we must pursue and win new business in the following areas: 
 
 Primary markets Capturing additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior products and services to address the needs of our major customers. 
 
 Growing markets Expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential. 
 
 New markets Developing new products and technologies that serve wholly new markets. 
 
 Complementary strategic relationships Through complementary acquisitions or similar arrangements, we believe we can expand our markets and strengthen our competitive position. As part of our growth strategy, the Company continues to selectively assess opportunities to develop strategic relationships, including acquisitions, investments and joint development projects with key partners and other businesses.

Distribution 
 
 In addition to marketing our proprietary products, we distribute complementary products made by manufacturers around the world. The products include environmental chambers, mechanical shock and vibration testers, and other semiconductor equipment. We also distribute a wide range of components such as connectors, sockets, cables, LCD displays and touch screen panels. We act as value-added resellers by enhancing the value of the distributed products by customizing each to the needs of our customers through our expert engineering, integration, and sub-assembly services. We also support our customers as their extended research development arm in product design, leveraging the expert skills of our component engineers and design engineers. 
 
 Real Estate 
 
 Our real estate segment generates rental income and investment income from real estate investments made in Chongqing, China. 
 
 Product Research and Development 
 
 We focus our research and development activities on improving and enhancing both product design and process technology. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in Singapore and the U.S. Research and development expense was 397 and 375 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Marketing, Distribution and Services 
 
 We market our products and services worldwide, directly and through independent sales representatives and our own marketing sales team. We have approximately five independent sales representatives operating in the U.S. and another twenty in foreign countries. All sales representatives represented the testing services and manufacturing segments for products and services produced and provided from our facilities in different locations. 
 
 Customer Concentration 
 
 During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, combined sales of equipment and services to our three largest customers accounted for approximately 59.4 and 65.9 , respectively, of our total net revenue. Of those sales, 14,595 (33.5 and 17,780 (40.3 of our total net revenue were from one major customer for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Although the major customer is a U.S. company, the revenue generated from it was from facilities located outside of the U.S. The majority of our sales and services in the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were made or provided to customers outside of the U.S. 
 
 Backlog 

The following table sets forth the Company s backlog as of June 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 
 For the Year Ended June 30,

101 

17,437 

17,463 

Real estate backlog represents the rental income from a non-cancellable lease. 
 
 Based on our past experience, we do not anticipate any significant cancellations or renegotiation of sales. The purchase orders for the manufacturing, testing services and distribution businesses generally require delivery within 12 months from the date of the purchase order and certain costs are incurred before delivery. In the event of a cancellation of a confirmed purchase order, we require our customers to reimburse us for all costs incurred. We do not anticipate any difficulties in meeting delivery schedules. For testing services, purchase orders are provided only during the process of delivery. Hence, the backlog is based on estimates provided by our customers and not based on a customer s purchase order. 
 
 Materials and Supplies 
 
 Our products are designed by our engineers and are assembled and tested at our facilities in the U.S., China and Singapore. We purchase all parts and certain components from outside vendors for assembly purposes. We have no written contracts with any of our key suppliers. As these parts and components are available from a variety of sources, we believe that the loss of any one of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations taken as a whole.

Table of Contents 

Competition 
 
 Our ability to compete is dependent on our ability to develop, introduce and sell new products, or enhanced versions of existing products, on a timely basis and at competitive prices, while reducing our costs. 
 
 Manufacturing Segment 
 
 The principal competitive factors in the manufacturing industry include product performance, reliability, service and technical support, product improvements, price, established relationships with customers and product familiarity. Although we have competitors for our various products, we believe that our products compete favorably with respect to each of the above factors. We have been in business for more than 60 years which has helped us to establish and nurture long-term relationships with customers. 
 
 Testing Segment 
 
 There are numerous testing laboratories located in the areas where we operate that perform testing similar to the testing that we offer. However, due to such competition in the industry, there has been a reduction in the total number of competitors in Asia. The existence of competing laboratories and the purchase of testing equipment by semiconductor manufacturers and users are potential threats to our future testing services revenue and earnings. Although these laboratories and competitors may challenge us at any time, we believe that other factors, including reputation, a long service history and strong customer relationships are instrumental in both maintaining and strengthening our position in the market. 
 
 Distribution Segment 
 
 Our distribution segment sells a wide range of components and semiconductor equipment. While the semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive, we offer the advantage of a one-stop service alternative for customers by complementing our products with design consultancy and other value-added services. 
 
 Patents 
 
 During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not register any patents within the U.S. 
 
 It is typical in the semiconductor industry to receive notices from time to time, alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We do not believe that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any others. However, should any claims be brought against us, the cost of litigating such claims and any damages could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Employees 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately 573 full-time employees and no part-time employees. Geographically, approximately 8 full-time employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 565 full-time employees in Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 
 
 There were approximately 56 employees in the manufacturing segment, 481 employees in the testing services segment, 3 employees in the distribution segment, 3 employees in the real estate segment and 30 employees in general administration, logistics and others as of June 30, 2023.

 As a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 
 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

 General Financial Information 
 
 Total assets as of June 30, 2023 were 42,186 a decrease of 1,235, or 2.8 , compared to 43,421 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, trade account receivables, other receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, operating lease right-of-use assets deferred tax assets, other assets, investment properties and property, plant and equipment. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in short-term deposits, assets held for sale and restricted term deposits. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2023 were 7,583, a decrease of 115, or 1.5 , compared to 7,698 at June 30, 2022, primarily due to the placement of fixed deposits. 
 
 Short-term deposits and restricted term deposits as of June 30, 2023 were 9,082, an increase of 1,984, or 28 compared to 7,098 at June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributed to the new placement of fixed deposits in the Singapore operation. 
 
 Trade account receivables as of June 30, 2023 was 9,804, representing an decrease of 1,788 or 15.4 , compared to 11,592 as of June 30, 2022. The reduction corresponds to the decline in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The number of days sales outstanding in account receivables was 82 days and 81 days for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 respectively. 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, other receivables were 939 a slight decrease of 59, or 5.9 , compared to 998 as of June 30, 2022. 
 
 Inventories as of June 30, 2023 were 2,151, a decrease of 107, or 4.7 , compared to 2,258 as of June 30, 2022, mainly due to currency translation effect. The number of days inventory held was 73 days at the end of Fiscal 2023, compared to 58 days at the end of Fiscal 2022. 
 
 Prepaid expenses as of June 30, 2023 were 694, a decrease of 521 from 1,215 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was attributable to the asset capitalization of down payments made for the purchase of equipment in the China operation. 
 
 Investment properties in China as of June 30, 2023 were 474, a decrease of 111 from 585 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was attributable to the depreciation charged for the year. 
 
 Property, plant and equipment as of June 30, 2023 was 8,344, a decrease of 137 compared to 8,481 as of June 30, 2022. This was mainly due to depreciation charged for the year and the foreign currency exchange movement between Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022. The decrease was partially offset by the new acquisition of property, plant and equipment in the Singapore, Malaysia, China and Thailand operations. 
 
 Other assets as of June 30, 2023 were 116, a decrease of 21, or 15.3 , compared to 137 as of June 30, 2022. 
 
 Total liabilities as of June 30, 2023 were 12,615, a decrease of 2,804, or 18.2 , compared to 15,419 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease in liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in lines of credits, accounts payable, accrued expense, income tax payable, operating leases, bank loans payable and finance lease, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities and other non-current liabilities.

Table of Contents 

Lines of credit as of June 30, 2023 decreased by 929 to 0 as of June 30, 2023. The decrease in lines of credit was due to repayment of lines of credit in the Singapore operation during the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 
 Accounts payable as of June 30, 2023 decreased by 741, or 30.9 to 1,660 from 2,401 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease in accounts payable is in line with the reduction in related cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Accrued expense as of June 30, 2023 decreased by 436, or 7.3 to 5,568 from 6,004 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses and sales tax. 
 
 Income tax payable as of June 30, 2023 decreased by 251 to 673 from 924 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower taxable profit in Fiscal 2023. 
 
 Bank loans payable decreased by 392 to 1,352 as of June 30, 2023, as compared to 1,744 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the repayments made in the Malaysia operation. 
 
 Finance leases decreased by 88 to 149 as of June 30, 2023, as compared to 237 as of June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the repayments made in the Singapore and Malaysia operations. 
 
 Other non-current liabilities increased by 566 to 594 as of June 30,2023, as compared to 28 as of June 30, 2022. The increase was mainly due to an increase in accruals relating to acquisition of property, plant and equipment in the China operations where the payments term is more than 12 months. 
 
 Operating lease right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities decreased by 543 to 2,609 as of June 30, 2023, as compared to 3,152 as of June 30, 2022. This was due to the repayment made and the operating lease expense charged for the period. The decrease was partially offset by additional cost and liabilities created by renewal of lease agreements during the period. 
 
 Uncertainties and Remedies 
 
 There are several influencing factors which create uncertainties when forecasting performance, such as the changing nature of technology, specific customer requirements, decline in demand for certain types of burn-in devices or equipment, decline in demand for testing services and fabrication services, and other factors. One factor that influences uncertainty is the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. Additionally, certain customers are unable to provide a forecast of the products required in the upcoming weeks, rendering it, difficult to plan adequate resources needed to meet these customers requirements as a result of short lead time and last-minute order confirmation. This will normally result in a lower margin for these products as it is often more expensive to purchase materials in a short time frame. However, the Company has taken certain actions and formulated certain plans to deal with and to help mitigate these unpredictable factors. For example, in order to meet manufacturing customers demands upon short notice, the Company maintains higher inventories but continues to work closely with its customers to avoid stockpiling. We believe that we have improved customer service through our efforts to keep our staff up to date on the newest technology, and stressing the importance of understanding and meeting the stringent requirements of our customers. Finally, the Company is exploring new markets and products, looking for new customers, and upgrading and improving burn-in technology while at the same time searching for improved testing methods for higher technology chips. 
 
 The Company s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expense in its subsidiaries. Strengthening of the United States dollar U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company s products. Margins on sales of the Company s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the U.S. Dollar s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. Dollar value of the Company s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. 
 
 As of June 2023, although we have seen improvements in both our operations and those of our suppliers, we may continue to experience supply shortages as well as inflationary cost pressures in at least the near term. Risks and uncertainties related to supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures may continue to negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. We continue to monitor and evaluate the business impact to react proactively. 
 
 On August 9, 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act) was enacted in the United States. The CHIPS Act will provide financial incentives to the semiconductor industry which are primarily directed at manufacturing activities within the United States. We continue to evaluate the business impact and potential opportunities related to the CHIPS Act. As of date, we do not see any direct effect of the CHIPS Act on the Company in the foreseeable future.

We sell our products and services worldwide, and our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business activities in geographic regions outside of the United States. Periods of macroeconomic weakness or recession and heightened market volatility caused by adverse geopolitical developments could increase these risks, potentially resulting in adverse impacts on our business operations. We expect the sales of products for delivery outside of the United States will continue to represent a substantial portion of our future net sales. Our future performance will depend significantly upon our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets which in turn will depend, in part, upon a continuation of current trade relations between the United States and foreign countries in which semiconductor manufactures or assemblers have operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates Policies 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition presented in this section are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. During the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to sales, returns, pricing concessions, bad debts, inventories, investments, fixed assets, intangible assets, income taxes and other impairments. Due to the events listed above, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. These estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 In response to the SEC s Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure about Critical Accounting Policy, we have identified the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial statements depends. We determined that those critical accounting policies are related to the inventory valuation; allowance for doubtful accounts; revenue recognition; impairment of property, plant and equipment; investment properties and income tax. These accounting policies are discussed in the relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis, including the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements discussed below. 
 
 Account Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
 During the normal course of business, we extend unsecured credit to our customers in all segments. Typically, credit terms require payment to be made between 30 to 90 days from the date of the sale. We generally do not require collateral from customers. We maintain our cash accounts at credit-worthy financial institutions. 
 
 The Company s management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company includes any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available to management, the Company believed that its allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of June 30, 2023. 
 
 Inventory Valuation 
 
 Inventories of our manufacturing and distribution segments, consisting principally of raw materials, works in progress, and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, short-term customer commitments and swiftly changing demand. Provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory are based on regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers. Inventories are written down for not-saleable, excess or obsolete raw materials, works-in-process and finished goods by charging such write-downs to cost of sales. In addition to write-downs based on newly introduced parts, statistics and judgments are used for assessing provisions of the remaining inventory based on saleability and obsolescence. 
 
 Property, Plant and Equipment Investment Properties 
 
 Property, plant and equipment and investment properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided for over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided for over the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. 
 
 Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged directly to expense as incurred. Additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions 
 
 The United States dollar U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the U.S. parent company. The Singapore dollar, the national currency of Singapore, is the primary currency of the economic environment in which the operations in Singapore are conducted. We also have business entities in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Indonesia, of which the Malaysian ringgit RM ), Thai baht, Chinese renminbi RMB and Indonesian rupiah are the national currencies. The Company uses the U.S. dollar for financial reporting purposes. 
 
 The Company translates assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date, and the statement of operations is measured using average rates in effect for the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in shareholders' equity as part of accumulated comprehensive income or loss translation adjustment. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of the Company s subsidiaries are reflected in income for the reporting period. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company follows Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC Topic 606 ). This standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
 
 We apply a five-step approach as defined in ASC Topic 606 in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contracts; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. 
 
 Revenue derived from testing services is recognized when testing services are rendered. Revenue generated from sale of products in the manufacturing and distribution segments are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the products has occurred, customer acceptance has been obtained (which means the control has been transferred to the customer), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain customers can request for installation and training services to be performed for certain products sold in the manufacturing segment. These services are mainly for helping customers with the test runs of the machines sold and are considered a separate performance obligation. Such services can be provided by other entities as well, and these do not significantly modify the product. The Company recognizes the revenue at the point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation. 
 
 In the real estate segment: (1) revenue from property development is earned and recognized on the earlier of the dates when the underlying property is sold or upon the maturity of the agreement; if this amount is uncollectible, the agreement empowers the repossession of the property, and (2) rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases. This means that, with respect to a particular lease, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period. Straight-line rental revenue is commenced when the tenant assumes possession of the leased premises. Accrued straight-line rents receivable represents the amount by which straight-line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with lease agreements. 
 
 Investment 
 
 The Company (a) evaluates the sufficiency of the total equity at risk, (b) reviews the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group, and whether there are any guaranteed returns, protection against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (c) establishes whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this Variable Interest Entity VIE determination. The Company would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a VIE if it was the primary beneficiary. Beginning January 1, 2010, a new accounting standard became effective and changed the method by which the primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined. Through a primarily qualitative approach, the variable interest holder, if any, who has the power to direct the VIE s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary. To the extent that the investment does not qualify as VIE, the Company further assesses the existence of a controlling financial interest under a voting interest model to determine whether the venture should be consolidated. 
 
 Equity Method 
 
 The Company analyzes its investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture should be accounted for using the equity method. Management evaluates both Common Stock and in-substance Common Stock as to whether they give the Company the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the joint venture even though the Company holds less than 50 of the Common Stock and in-substance Common Stock. If so, the net income of the joint venture will be reported as Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net of tax in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss. 

10

Table of Contents 

Cost Method 
 
 Investee companies not accounted for under the consolidation or the equity method of accounting are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under this method, the Company s share of the earnings or losses of such investee companies is not included in the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss. However, impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss. If circumstances suggest that the value of the investee company has subsequently recovered, such recovery is not recorded. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets Impairment 
 
 Our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand. We have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions. 
 
 We evaluate our long-lived assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. Impairment is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis, if there is significant adverse change. 
 
 We have not identified any changes in circumstances requiring further impairment test in Fiscal 2023 except the phasing out of burn-in service contract with a customer in our Malaysia operation. In June 2023, our Malaysia operation received notification of termination of contract from a customer effective January 2024. In consideration of this impairment indicator, Management has performed further impairment test and concluded that the carrying amount of the primary assets used solely for servicing this customer is fully recoverable during the phase-out period until December 2023 and hence no specific impairment will be recognized in this regard as at 30th June 2023. We will continue to monitor impairment indicators, such as disposition activity, stock price declines or changes in forecasted cash flows in future periods. If the fair value of our reporting unit declines below the carrying value in the future, we may incur additional impairment charges. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 Under the standard ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Topic 820 ), fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts its business. ASC Topic 820 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In support of this principle, ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Income Tax 
 
 We account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740 , Accounting for Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ), which requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Further, the effects of enacted tax laws or rate changes are included as part of deferred tax expense or benefits in the period that covers the enactment date. Management believed it was more likely than not that the future benefits from these timing differences would not be realized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was provided as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We calculate compensation expense related to stock option awards made to employees and directors based on the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant. We determine the grant date fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for awards without performance condition, the related stock-based compensation is recognized over the period in which a participant is required to provide service in exchange for the stock-based award, which is generally four years. We recognize stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.

Table of Contents 

Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as other subjective assumptions including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility over the expected term of the awards, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management s best estimates and are as follows: 

Fair Value of Common Stock. We determined the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. 

Expected Term. The expected term of employee stock options reflects the period for which we believe the option will remain outstanding based on historical experience and future expectations. 

Expected Volatility. We base expected volatility on our historical information over a similar expected term. 

Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 ASC Topic 810, Consolidation ASC Topic 810 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary. This guidance requires that non-controlling interests in subsidiaries be reported in the equity section of the controlling company s balance sheet. It also changes the way the net income of the subsidiary is reported and disclosed in the controlling company s income statement. 
 
 Loan Receivables 
 
 The loan receivables are classified as current assets carried at face value and are individually evaluated for impairment. The allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable losses determined principally on the basis of historical experience and specific allowances for known loan accounts. All loans or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible or require an excessive collection cost are written off to the allowance for losses. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income on loans is recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. The amortization of discounts into income is discontinued on loans that are contractually 90 days past due or when collection of interest appears doubtful. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2022-02 updating Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326: Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings TDR ") and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 ), which require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. The Company has completed its assessment and concluded that ASU 2022-02 has no significant impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue during Fiscal 2023 was 43,250, a decrease of 815, or 1.8 , compared to 44,065 during Fiscal 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decrease in sales from the distribution segments resulting from inventory corrections made by customers. 
 
 Manufacturing Segment 
 
 The Manufacturing segment accounted for 32.0 of revenue during Fiscal 2023, an increase of 1.3 , compared to 30.7 during Fiscal 2022. Revenue generated by the Manufacturing segment during Fiscal 2023 was 13,827, reflecting an increase of 301, or 2.2 , compared to 13,526 during Fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue generated by the Manufacturing segment was due to an increase in board sales in the Singapore operations. 
 
 Backlog in the Manufacturing segment was 8,056 as of June 30, 2023, representing an increase of 1,079 from 6,977 as of June 30, 2022. The increase is backlog is attributed to orders received in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, as market demand for testing equipment shows signs of gradual recovery, following the weakening of the global semiconductor industry that began in 2023. These orders are expected to be fulfilled over the next four quarters of Fiscal 2024. 
 
 Testing Segment 
 
 Revenue generated by the Testing segment accounted for 53.4 of total revenue during Fiscal 2023, as compared to 44.2 during Fiscal 2022. Revenue generated by the Testing segment for Fiscal 2023 was 23,130, reflecting an increase of 3,653, or 18.8 , compared to 19,477 for Fiscal 2022. The increase is mainly attributed to the new subsidiary in China which was not fully operational in Fiscal 2022. The increase was partially offset by a drop in volume in Singapore and other China operations due to the lower demand resulting from weakening of global semiconductor industry. 
 
 Backlog in the Testing segment as of June 30, 2023 was 5,402, a decrease of 296, compared to 5,698 at June 30, 2022. The decrease in backlog was mainly from the China and Malaysia operations. Backlog is dependent on the estimated volume provided by customers, which is dependent on the customers inventory levels and demand.

Distribution Segment 
 
 Revenue generated by the Distribution segment during Fiscal 2023 accounted for 14.5 of total revenue, a decrease of 10.5 compared to 25 for Fiscal 2022. Revenue for Fiscal 2023 was 6,270, a decrease of 4,767, or 43.2 , compared to 11,037 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease in revenue in our Distribution segment was mainly due to inventory adjustments made by our end customers who are currently carrying excess inventory, due to which demand is decreased and deliveries are being pushed out to next fiscal year. 
 
 Backlog in the Distribution segment as of June 30, 2023 was 3,882, reflecting a decrease of 805 compared to the backlog of 4,687 at June 30, 2022. The decrease in backlog was mainly due to a decreased demand from customers. Equipment and electronic component sales are very competitive, as the products are readily available in the market. We believe that our competitive advantage in the distribution segment is that we act as value-added resellers by enhancing the value of the distributed products by customizing them to the needs of our customers through our expert design, engineering, integration, and sub-assembly services. We expect the demand for our products in the distribution segment to increase in Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023, aligned with the expected semiconductor industry rebounds in 2024. 
 
 Real Estate Segment 
 
 Revenue generated by the Real Estate segment was 0.1 of total revenue for each of the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Revenue generated by the Real Estate segment for Fiscal 2023 was 23, a decrease of 2, or 8 , compared to 25 for Fiscal 2022. Our Real Estate segment saw a decrease in rental income due to the low occupancy rate in the MaoYe and FuLi properties due to slower post-pandemic recovery in China. 
 
 Backlog in the Real Estate segment as of June 30, 2023, was 97, a slight decrease of 4 as compared to 101 at June 30, 2022. 
 
 Gross Margin 
 
 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 27.1 in Fiscal 2023, an increase of 0.5 compared to 26.6 in Fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was mainly attributable to the Testing segment. Overall gross profit for Fiscal 2023 was 11,705, a decrease of 28, or 0.2 , compared to 11,733 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease in the dollar value of the overall gross margin was mainly due to a decrease in overall sales. 
 
 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the Manufacturing segment was 23.4 in Fiscal 2023, a decrease of 1.6 , compared to 25 in Fiscal 2022. Gross profit for the Manufacturing segment in Fiscal 2023 was 3,240, a decrease of 139 or 4.1 , compared to 3,379 in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to higher lower-margin burn-in-board sales in our Singapore operations. 
 
 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the Testing segment was 32.3 in Fiscal 2023, a decrease of 1.2 , compared to 33.5 in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the lower volume in individual test laboratories in China and Malaysia, resulting from weaking of global semiconductor industry. Increased manpower costs and energy costs have a direct impact on the operating margin of the Testing segment. Gross profit in the Testing segment in Fiscal 2023 was 7,472, an increase of 955, or 14.6 , compared to 6,517 in Fiscal 2022 due to the additional sales contributed by the new subsidiary in China. 
 
 Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the Distribution segment was 16.6 in Fiscal 2023, a decrease of 0.5 , compared to 17.1 in Fiscal 2022. Gross profit in the Distribution segment was 1,042, a decrease of 848, or 44.9 , compared to 1,890 in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin of the Distribution segment was mainly due to a decline in sales due to inventory adjustments made by our customers. 
 
 Gross loss in the Real Estate segment was 49 in Fiscal 2023, a decrease of 4 as compared to 53 in Fiscal 2022. 
 
 Operating Expense

General and administrative expense was 8,403 in Fiscal 2023, an increase of 42 or 0.5 , compared to 8,361 in Fiscal 2022. The increase in general and administrative expense was mainly due to the administrative expense relating to the Company's new subsidiary Trio-Tech Jiangsu which was setup in the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 and became operational in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation costs and effective cost control in the China operations in response to reduced volume.

Table of Contents 

Selling expense increased by 27, or 4.2 , to 670 in Fiscal 2023, compared to 643 in Fiscal 2022. The increase in selling expense was primarily attributable to an increase in commission expense in the Singapore operations as a result of higher commissionable sales, and an increase in travel costs due to increased business travel in Fiscal 2023, compared to Fiscal 2022. 
 
 Profit from Operations 
 
 Profit from operations was 2,228 in Fiscal 2023, a decrease of 125, compared to profit from operations of 2,353 in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in profit from operations was mainly due to increased operating expenses as disclosed elsewhere in this Report .

Other income decreased by 489 to 106 for Fiscal 2023, compared to 595 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease was mainly a result of a negative foreign currency impact due to the strengthening of the Singapore dollars against U.S. Dollars in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, and the absence of one-time commission income that was earned in Fiscal 2022. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates on short term deposits in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. 
 
 Government Grant 
 
 During Fiscal 2023, the Company received government grants amounting to 153, 107 of which was financial assistance received from the Singapore government. 
 
 During Fiscal 2022, the Company received government grants amounting to 228, 139 of which was financial assistance received from the Singapore and Malaysia governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Income Tax (Expense) / Benefits 
 
 Income tax expense for Fiscal 2023 was 622, representing a decrease of 135, as compared to income tax expense of 757 for Fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower taxable income in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. 
 
 At June 30, 2023, the Company had no federal net operating loss carry-forwards, and a state net operating loss carry-forward of 1,940, which expires in 2033. These carryovers may be subject to limitations under I.R.C. Section 382. In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on these criteria, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will not realize the benefits of the federal, state, and foreign deductible differences. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets recorded in the US and various foreign jurisdictions.

Table of Contents 

Net cash used in investing activities increased by 5,630 to an outflow of 6,074 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 444 in the prior year. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in outflow of 4,715 used for investments in unrestricted deposits and 3,030 used on additional property, plant and equipment. The increase was partially offset by increase in cash inflows of 2,037 from the withdrawal of unrestricted deposits. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023, was 1,243, compared to an inflow of 911 during the prior year. Net cash used in financing activities increased mainly due to repayment of lines of credit availed in the prior year. 
 
 We believe that our projected cash flows from operations, borrowing availability under our revolving lines of credit, cash on hand, trade credit and the secured bank loans will provide the necessary financial resources to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. The Company filed a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 on December 3, 2021, under which we may raise capital of US 10,000,000 from any combination of securities (common stock, warrants, debt securities or units) for business expansion and working capital purposes if necessary. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Our working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) has historically been generated primarily from the following sources: operating cash flow, availability under our revolving line of credit, and short-term loans. Working capital was 19,501 as of June 30, 2023, representing an increase of 2,228, or 12.9 , compared to working capital of 17,273 as of June 30, 2022. The increase in working capital was mainly due to increases in current assets, including short-term deposits, and restricted term deposits, and decreases in current liabilities, including lines of credit, accounts payable, income taxes payable, finance leases, and operating leases. Such fluctuations were partially offset by decreases in current assets, including cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and other accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and finance sales receivable, and increases in current liabilities, including accrued and bank loans payable. 
 
 The majority of our capital expenditures are based on demands from our customers, as we are operating in a capital-intensive industry. Our capital expenditures were 4,584 and 1,468 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The capital expenditures in Fiscal 2023 were mainly in the Singapore, China, Malaysia and Thailand operations, which provide testing services to our customers. We financed our capital expenditures and other operating expense through operating cash flows and long-term debts. 
 
 Our credit rating provides us with ready and adequate access to funds in the global market. At June 30, 2023, the Company had certain lines of credit that are collateralized by restricted deposits.

 The information called for by this item is included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning on page 27 of this Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 An evaluation was carried out by the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the principal executive and principal financial officers, respectively, of the Company) of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of June 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023. 
 
 Additionally, management has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and thus also assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. Management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purpose in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and 
 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, and use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of June 30, 2023. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
 Trio Tech International 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trio-Tech International and its Subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
 The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

The basis of accounting differs from that used in the statutory financial statements of the Company s subsidiaries and equity investee companies, which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries of incorporation.

These factors create pressures on sales, costs, earnings and cash flows, which can impact liquidity. 

to days from the date of the sale. The Company generally does not require collateral from our customers. The Company s management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company includes any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve, in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available to management, the Company believed that its allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.

ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance include available-for-sale investments, employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. As such, fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific measure. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. treasuries, most money market funds, marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan; 
 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, directly or indirectly. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include foreign currency forward exchange contracts, most commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds; and 
 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Restricted deposits represent the amount of cash pledged to secure loans payable or trade financing granted by financial institutions and serve as collateral for public utility agreements such as electricity and water, and performance bonds related to customs duty payable. Restricted deposits are classified as current and non-current depending on whether they relate to long-term or short-term obligations. As at year ended June 30, 2023, restricted deposits of are classified as current assets as they relates to short-term trade financing. Restricted deposits of are classified as non-current assets as they relate to long-term obligations and will become unrestricted only upon discharge of the obligations. Short-term deposits represent bank deposits, which do not qualify as cash equivalents.

 Effective rate 

The provision for income taxes has been determined based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which we operate. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. 
 
 Due to the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company is subject to a tax on global intangible low-taxed income GILTI . GILTI is a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. Companies subject to GILTI have the option to account for the GILTI tax as a period cost if and when incurred, or to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences including outside basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore has included GILTI expense in its effective tax rate calculation for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company accrues penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits when necessary as a component of penalties and interest expenses, respectively. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits or related accrued penalties or interest expenses at June 30, 2023. 
 
 In assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on these criteria, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will not realize the benefits of the federal, state, and foreign deductible differences. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets recorded in the US and various foreign jurisdictions. 

Temporary differences that give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

 Right-of-use assets

 At June 30, 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carry-forward and state net operating loss carry-forward of , which expire through 2033. These carryovers may be subject to limitations under I.R.C. Section 382. Management of the Company is uncertain whether it is more likely than not that these future benefits will be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance was established. 
 
 Generally, U.S. federal, state, and foreign authorities may examine the Company s tax returns for three years, four years, and five years, respectively, from the date an income tax return is filed. However, the taxing authorities may continue to adjust the Company s net operating loss carry-forwards until the statute of limitations closes on the tax years in which the net operating losses are utilized. 

Manufacturing 
 
 The Company primarily derives revenue from the sale of both front-end and back-end semiconductor test equipment and related peripherals, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services, and the sale of spare parts. The Company s revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. The Company uses judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators, including whether: 
 
 the Company has a present right to payment; 
 
 the customer has legal title; 
 
 the customer has physical possession; 
 
 the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and 
 
 the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same equipment, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory). 

Not all the indicators need to be met for the Company to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with its performance obligations of product installation and training services are deferred and recognized upon acceptance. 
 
 Majority of sales under the Manufacturing segment include a 12 -month warranty. The Company generally provides a limited warranty that our products comply with applicable specifications at the time of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective parts. The Company has concluded that the warranty provided for standard products are assurance type warranties and are not separate performance obligations. 
 
 Customized products are generally more complex and, as a result, may contain unforeseen faults that could lead to additional costs for us, including increased servicing or the need to provide product modifications. Warranty provided for customized products are service warranties and are separate performance obligations. Transaction prices are allocated to this performance obligation using cost plus method. The portion of revenue associated with warranty service is deferred and recognized as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by the Company. 
 
 Testing 
 
 The Company renders testing services to manufacturers and purchasers of semiconductors and other entities who either lack testing capabilities or whose in-house screening facilities are insufficient. The Company primarily derives testing revenue from burn-in services, manpower supply and other associated services. SSP is directly observable from the sales orders. Revenue is allocated to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time depending upon terms of the sales order. Generally, there is no other performance obligation other than what has been stated inside the sales order for each of these sales. 
 
 Terms of contract that may indicate potential variable consideration included warranty, late delivery penalty and reimbursement to solve nonconformance issues for rejected products. Based on historical and recent data trends, it is concluded that these terms of the contract do not represent potential variable consideration. The transaction price is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. 
 
 Distribution 
 
 The Company distributes complementary products, made by manufacturers around the world. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at a point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. The Company uses judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators discussed above. The Company recognizes the revenue at a point in time, generally upon shipment or delivery of the products to the customer or distributors, depending upon terms of the sales order. 

Contract Balances 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and collections may result in billed account receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, and customer advances, deposits and contract liabilities. The Company s payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment of 70 to 90 of total contract consideration within 30 to 60 days of shipment, with the remainder payable within 30 days of acceptance. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. 
 
 Contract assets were recorded under other receivable while contract liabilities were recorded under accrued expense in the balance sheet. 
 
 The following table is the reconciliation of contract balances.

Remaining Performance Obligation 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, the Company had of remaining performance obligations, which represents our obligation to deliver products and services. Given the profile of contract terms, this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next two years. 
 
 As at June 30, 2022, the Company had of remaining performance obligations, which represents our obligation to deliver products and services. 
 
 Practical Expedients 
 
 The Company applies the following practical expedients: 
 
 The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfil the promise to transfer the goods, instead of a promised service to its customer. 
 
 The Company has not elected to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less. 
 
 The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient for contract costs, specifically in relation to incremental costs of obtaining a contract. 

Costs to obtain a contract are not material, and the Company generally expenses such costs as incurred because the amortization period is one year or less.

The expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company s Common Stock. Due to higher volatility, the observation was made on a daily basis for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 respectively. The observation period covered is consistent with the expected life of the options. The expected life of the options granted to employees has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by ASC Topic 718 Stock Based Compensation , which, among other provisions, allows companies without access to adequate historical data about employee exercise behavior to use a simplified approach for estimating the expected life of a "plain vanilla" option grant. The simplified rule for estimating the expected life of such an option is the average of the time to vesting and the full term of the option. The risk-free rate is consistent with the expected life of the stock options and is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
