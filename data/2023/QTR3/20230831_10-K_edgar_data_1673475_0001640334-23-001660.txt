BUSINESS General Overview History GPO Plus, Inc. (the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016, under the name Koldeck, Inc. for the purpose of operating a publishing business providing services of professional ghost writers, content writers, editors and publishers. We have since changed our business model and now operating as a publicly traded global holding company of industry specific group purchasing organizations (GPOs), presently trading under the stock symbol GPOX. Our business and corporate headquarters address is 3571 E. Sunset Road, Suite 300, Las Vegas, NV 89120 and our telephone number is 702-840-1020. Our corporate website is gpoplus.com and our section for shareholder is gpoplus.com/ir. We do not have any subsidiaries as of the date of this Annual Report. 4 Table of Contents The Company Our Current Business GPOPlus+ (GPOX) GPO Plus (GPOX) is a product development, manufacturing, and distribution company which offers a diverse portfolio of high-quality innovative products sold directly to consumers and retailers. Our business is organized around four key areas: products (developing and manufacturing), distribution (getting our products to customers), marketing (promoting our products), and sales (selling our products to consumers and retailers). Our goal is to expand our product line and distribution reach to meet market demand and the needs of our customers. Our business is organized around four key areas: Products (developing and manufacturing unique products) Distribution (getting our products to customers through Direct to store Delivery "DSD" and independent sales organizations "ISO's") Branding (promoting our Products and our Company) Sales (a technology and data-driven approach) We recently successfully deployed our new White Glove Direct to Store DSD service. This new service includes new point of sale displays for our flagship brand The Feel Good Shop+ and Mr. Vapor . To implement the new DSD service program GPOX created Mini Hubs supported by a Regional Distribution Hub in Lubbock, Texas. Currently, GPOX services approximately 570 stores across 12 states centralized in the Southwest and Midwest regions of the United States. The Company has already identified 316 locations approved for the new program, with approximately 100 currently active. The next 116 stores in Dallas, TX, Austin, TX, and Albuquerque, NM, plan to be activated before the end of October 2023. The Company also has in its growth plans to activate an additional 103 stores in Wyoming, Kansas, and Missouri marketplaces by the end of October 2023. Once the Company opens a Mini Hub, sales teams actively look to add additional specialty retailers (gas stations, smoke shops, vape shops, and liquor stores), with a goal of each Mini Hub servicing approximately 100 to 150 locations. This equates to an initial goal of 1,000 to 1,500 retail locations to be supported by the Regional Hub in Lubbock. Our Divisions DISTRO+ DISTRO+ is a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) + distributor of premium products for the emerging specialty retailer sector and wholesalers. DISTRO+ proudly represents best-in-class brands focusing on nutraceuticals, hemp-derived Farm Bill Compliant products, and Kratom. DISTRO+ operates a Direct to Store Delivery DSD distribution model, which provides its customers with the highest level of service. It s backed by a robust technology portal that gives our partners and customers the IT backbone to manage logistics, inventory, and payments while shopping from real time product catalogues and inventory. Through the power of Group Purchasing, DISTRO+ offers its network competitive pricing with low MOQs that realize similar discounts as major retailers with large buying power. 5 Table of Contents Nutriumph Supplements Nutriumph is an innovative supplement company whose mission is to offer premium nutraceuticals to assist consumers to reach their health and wellness goals with natural ingredients.

Since its inception, Nutriumph developed a strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) online sales infrastructure including optimized and seasoned seller accounts on Amazon, Walmart Marketplace, Etsy, and eBay as well as their primary websites Nutriumph.com and HERBERALL.com. The next growth phase will be expanding Nutriumph and HERBERALL into retailers nationally through our distribution division, DISTRO+.

GPOX Labs GPOX Labs is the division of GPOPlus+ that powers its technology, product development, and digital marketing to drive growth by improving operational efficiencies, developing innovative consumer products, and exploring new ways to connect with customers. Our Products Our product portfolio comprises best-in-class, high-quality, innovative, and fully compliant products representing numerous brands spanning multiple categories. We offer GPOX Brands, Licensed Brands, and Partner Brands, each designed to deliver value and performance to our customers. GPOX Brands - GPOX branded products have the highest margins for GPOX. The initial focus has been on CBD, recreational hemp, and nutraceutical products where the Company maintains a competitive advantage, creating long term value to the Company with proprietary house brands. We strategically evaluate additional house brands that align with current distribution channels to grow GPOX. Licensed Brands - We collaborate with established brands to create and manufacture high quality products that consumers are familiar with. We enter Licensing Agreements and pay a royalty on products sold, normally with exclusivity. By way of example, we completed a licensing agreement to create Yuengling's Ice Cream flavored recreational hemp and CBD products, as many people are familiar with the brand that is currently sold at thousands of retail locations. Partner Brands - We identify "category killer" established brands such as Mr. Vapor and FLAVYOR'S and enter into distribution agreements to help increase sales for our Partner brands. 6 Table of Contents Product Categories Vitamins, Nutraceuticals + Nutritional Products. Tobacco: Disposable Nicotine Vape Products+ Accessories. General Merchandise for Specialty Retailers. Recreational Hemp, Kratom + CBD Consumer Packaged Goods. Branding + Marketing Branding begins with creating meaningful connections between our brands and their audience. While point of sale placement at retailers provides immediate attention, we create additional touch points to create brand awareness, build loyalty and increase sales. This may sound like a basic concept, but many companies approach their products as commodities, and we strongly disagree with that strategy. We differentiate ourselves by using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, marketing platforms, and channels to engage with our existing customers creating multiple touch points to expand our reach to new audiences. We constantly test and iterate new marketing strategies and techniques to find the most effective ways to build brand awareness and increase revenue. Sales GPOX has multiple sales channels to sell our products both direct-to-consumer and to retailers. Our sales channels include online eCommerce, tele sales, and traditional retail channels. The Company developed proprietary software, MSRP+ ("Multiple Site Replicating Platform"), which allows multiple fully Search Engine Optimized eCommerce websites to be supported from one centralized backend platform, creating efficiencies to test targeted digital campaigns, reduce costs, improve the shopping experience, analyze market opportunities, and enhance the Company's competitive edge. As we continue to develop and optimize our sales channels, we explore new and innovative ways to meet the evolving needs of our customers and drive growth in our business. Our strategic approach to sales, coupled with our focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, underscores our commitment to delivering long-term value for our investors. Suppliers We source our products from various suppliers and serve as an important partner for our suppliers by providing them access to our growing customer base. Many of our suppliers provide products to each of our reportable divisions, while others sell to only one division. Our supplier base consists of large and small vendors selling national regional brands. We particularly maintain close relations with vendors specializing in our CBD products as these are products new to the US market. Many of our suppliers provide sales material and sales support for the products that we purchase. Pricing Our pricing for customers is either set by contract with the customer or is priced at the time of order. If the price is by contract, fixed markup per unit. Trademarks and Trade Names We have perpetual trademarks and trade names that are of significant importance, including HERBERALL and Nutriumph . Human Capital Resources One of our primary strategies is to attract, train, develop, and retain talented individuals who feel empowered to fully contribute their diverse backgrounds, experiences, and innovative ideas to the success of the Company. We also recognize the importance of keeping our associates safe and healthy, as well as giving them a voice and listening to their concerns and suggestions. Available Information We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available to the public on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Those filings are also available to the public on, or accessible through, our website for free via the Investors section at www.pfgc.com. The information we file with the SEC or contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference herein and is not part of this Form 10-K. Website and social media Disclosure We use our website (www.gpoplus.com) and our corporate Facebook and Twitter accounts as channels of distribution of company information. The information we post through these channels may be deemed material. Accordingly, investors should monitor these channels, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. In addition, you may automatically receive e-mail alerts and other information about GPO when you enroll in your e-mail address by visiting the Newsletter section of our website at investors.gpoplus.com. The contents of our website and social media channels are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K. Government Regulation GPOX is regulated by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. These regulatory bodies establish standards concerning product quality, sanitation, workplace safety, and distribution policies. The Company operates in 12 states and is required to adhere to state regulations regarding the distribution and sale of nicotine, tobacco, and Farm Bill compliant hemp derived CBD products. These regulations usually involve licensing and bonding requirements. Additionally, both state and federal regulatory agencies have the authority to levy excise taxes on cigarette and tobacco products. In recent times, several states have increased these excise taxes in response to budget shortfalls and to discourage tobacco product usage. We anticipate this trend to persist as legislators seek alternative revenue sources and ways to discourage nicotine, tobacco, and Farm Bill compliant hemp derived CBD consumption. 7 Table of Contents Status of Any Publicly Announced New Product or Service. We have not developed any new or unique products or services that have not already been announced. Dependence on Limited Customers We are not dependent upon any specific customers at this time.

Employees and Consultants We had 8 employees as of April 30, 2023, or as at the date of this Annual Report. As of the date of this Annual Report we are actively recruiting employees.

Our common shares have been listed for quotation on the OTCQB under the trading symbol GPOX since March 2021. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company s operations or business prospects. OTC securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Market issuers are traditionally smaller companies that are financially distressed, in bankruptcy, or do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.

Dividends We have not paid any cash dividends to our shareholders. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements and financial position, our general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. Equity Compensation Plans On March 27, 2023, the board of directors and majority shareholder of the Company approved the adoption of the GPO Plus, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan ). The purpose of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan is to foster and promote the Company s long-term financial success and increase stockholder value by motivating performance through incentive compensation. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan is intended to encourage participants to acquire and maintain ownership interests in the Company and to attract and retain the services of talented individuals upon whose judgment and special efforts the successful conduct of the Company s business is largely dependent. A total of 2,200,000 shares of common stock are reserved and may be issued under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares and performance units to our employees, officers, directors, and consultants, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and other benefits. 10 Table of Contents The following table provides information regarding our equity compensation plans as of April 30, 2023: Equity Compensation Plan Information Number of securities to Weighted- be issued average Number of securities upon exercise exercise price remaining available of outstanding of outstanding for future issuance options, options, under equity warrants and warrants and compensation plans Plan category rights rights (1) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 1,867,122 common - N/A shares (1) On April 4, 2023, the Company issued 332,878 shares of immediately vested common stock to employees and consultants under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan.

The decrease in net loss during the year ended April 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in the operating expenses, which was primarily attributable to an approximately 26 million decrease in stock-based compensation during fiscal 2023 as compared to 2022.

We will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses. Specifically, based on nominal operations we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows: Estimated Description Expenses ) Public Company + Professional Fees 170,000 General Administrative Expense 800,000 Marketing Expenses 540,000 Initial Personnel 150,000 GPO Distro 500,000 GPO Supplies - Inventory 70,000 Unallocated Working Capital/Contingency 100,000 Total Expenses 2,330,000 We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately 2,330,000 over the next 12 months to pay for our planned expenses. In addition, our planned expenses, including legal, accounting and audit fees, and general and administrative expenses, may be higher in the event we enter into any significant transactions. These planned cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Although our cash requirements may be offset in part by anticipated revenues, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations, execute our business plan, and repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources. Contractual Obligations Not required for smaller reporting companies Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 14 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Revenue Recognition During the year ended April 30, 2023, the Company generated its first revenue since its establishment. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition following the five steps procedure: The invoice has been generated and provided to the customer. The performance obligations for delivery of products are stated in the invoice. The transaction price has been identified in the invoice. The Company has allocated the transaction price to performance obligation in the invoice. The Company has shipped out the product and, therefore, satisfied the performance obligation. 15 Table of Contents Convertible Financial Instruments The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP. When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument. Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all such compensation to employees and non-employees to be calculated based on its fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date and recognized in the earnings over the requisite service or vesting period.

These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 22 Table of Contents Use of Estimates Reclassifications Cash and Cash Equivalents and , respectively.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, April 30, 2023. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer). Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, including our President and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 41 Table of Contents Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of April 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending April 30, 2024: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm because as a smaller reporting company we are not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls Our management, which consists of our sole officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements, due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Except as provided above, there is no information to be disclosed in a report on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Form 10-K that has not been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
