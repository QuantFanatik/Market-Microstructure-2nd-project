 ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS 
 Our Business 
 We are the largest 
producer and distributor of shell eggs in the United States. Our mission is to be the most sustainable 
producer 
 and reliable 
supplier of 
consistent, high 
quality fresh 
shell eggs 
and egg 
products 
in the 
country, 
demonstrating 
a "Culture 
of 
 Sustainability" in everything we do, and 
creating value for our shareholders, 
customers, team members and communities. We sell 
 most of our shell 
eggs in the southwestern, 
southeastern, mid-western and 
mid-Atlantic regions of the 
U.S. and aim to maintain 
 efficient, state-of-the-art operations located close to our customers. We 
were founded in 1957 by the late Fred R. Adams, Jr. and 
 are headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi. 
 The Company has one reportable 
operating segment, which is the production, 
grading, packaging, marketing and distribution 
of 
 shell eggs. Our integrated 
operations consist of hatching 
chicks, growing and maintaining 
flocks of pullets, layers 
and breeders, 
 manufacturing feed, and 
producing, processing, packaging, and 
distributing shell eggs. 
Layers are mature 
female chickens, pullets 
 are female chickens usually less than 18 weeks of age, and breeders are male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to 
 be hatched for egg production 
flocks. Our total flock as of 
June 3, 2023 consisted of approximately 
41.2 million layers and 10.8 
 million pullets and breeders. 
 Many of our customers rely 
on us to provide most of 
their shell egg needs, including 
specialty and conventional eggs. 
Specialty 
 eggs encompass 
a broad 
range of 
products. We 
classify cage-free, 
organic, 
brown, free-range, 
pasture-raised 
and nutritionally 
 enhanced 
as specialty 
eggs 
for 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
purposes. 
We 
classify 
all other 
shell 
eggs 
as conventional 
products. 
 While we report separate sales information 
for these egg types, there are 
many cost factors that are not 
specifically available for 
 conventional or 
specialty eggs 
due to 
the nature 
of egg 
production. We 
manage our 
operations and 
allocate resources 
to these 
 types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. 

4 
 We 
believe that 
an important 
competitive advantage 
for Cal-Maine 
Foods is our 
ability to meet 
our customers 
evolving needs 
 with a 
favorable product 
mix of 
conventional and 
specialty eggs, 
including cage-free, 
organic and 
other specialty 
offerings, as 
 well 
as egg 
products. 
We 
have 
also 
enhanced 
our efforts 
to provide 
free-range 
and pasture 
-raised 
eggs that 
meet 
consumers 
 evolving choice preferences. 
While a small 
part of our 
current business, 
the free-range and 
pasture-raised eggs 
we produce and 
 sell represent 
attractive 
offerings 
to a 
subset of 
consumers, and 
therefore 
our customers, 
and 
help us 
continue 
to serve 
as the 
 trusted provider of quality food choices. 
 Throughout the Company s history, 
we have acquired other companies in our industry. Since 1989 through our fiscal year ended 
 June 3, 2023, 
we have completed 
23 acquisitions ranging 
in size from 
160 thousand layers to 
7.5 million layers. Most 
recently, 
 effective on May 30, 2021, the Company acquired 
the remaining 50 membership interest in Red River Valley 
Egg Farm, LLC 
 Red River ), which owns and operates a specialty shell egg production complex that includes 1.7 million cage-free hens. For a 
 further 
description 
of 
this 
transaction, 
refer 
to 
Part 
II. 
Item 
8. 
Notes 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, 
 Note 2 
 Acquisition 
 . We are also focused on additional ways to enhance our product mix and support new opportunities in the restaurant, 
 institutional and 
commercial food 
preparation area. 
Beginning in fiscal 
2022, we have 
invested approximately 
 32.3 million in 
 Meadowcreek Foods, 
LLC Meadowcreek ), 
an egg 
products operation 
focused on 
offering 
hard-cooked eggs. 
In addition 
to 
 growth through 
acquisitions, we 
have also 
grown by 
making substantial 
investments in 
our business, 
primarily to 
increase our 
 cage-free production capacity. 
 When 
we 
use 
 we, 
 us, 
 our, 
or 
the 
 Company 
in 
this 
report, 
we 
mean 
Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. 
and 
our 
consolidated 
 subsidiaries, 
unless 
otherwise 
indicated 
or

otherwise 
requires. 
The 
Company s 
fiscal 
year-end 
is 
on 
the 
Saturday 
 closest to May 
31. Our 
fiscal year 
2023 and 
fourth quarter ended 
June 3, 2023, 
included 53 weeks 
and 14 
weeks, respectively. 
 The first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2023 ended August 27, 2022, 
November 26, 2022, and February 25, 2023, all included 13 
 weeks. 
All references herein to a fiscal year means our fiscal year and all references 
to a year mean a calendar year. 

 Industry Background 
 According to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture USDA Agricultural 
Marketing Service, in 2022 approximately 
71 of table 
 eggs produced in the U.S. 
were sold as shell 
eggs, with 56.6 sold through food 
at home outlets such 
as grocery and convenience 
 stores, 12.4 sold to 
food-away-from home channels such 
as restaurants and 1.7 exported. 
The USDA estimated that in 
2022 
 approximately 29.6 
of eggs 
produced in 
the U.S. 
were sold 
as egg 
products (shell 
eggs broken 
and sold 
in liquid, 
frozen, or 
 dried 
form) 
to 
institutions 
(e.g. 
companies 
producing 
baked 
goods). 
For 
information 
about 
egg 
producers 
in 
the 
U.S., 
see 
 Competition below. 

 Our 
industry 
has 
been 
greatly 
impacted 
by 
the 
outbreaks 
of 
highly 
pathogenic 
avian 
influenza HPAI ), 
first 
detected 
in 
 commercial flocks in 
the U.S. in 
February 2022 and 
continuing during our 
fiscal 2023. For 
additional information regarding HPAI 
 and its impact 
on our industry 
and business, see 
 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
 and Results of Operations 
 . 
 Given 
historical 
consumption 
trends, 
we believe 
that general 
demand 
for 
eggs in 
the U.S. 
increases basically 
in line 
with the 
 overall 
U.S. 
population 
growth; 
however, 
specific 
events 
can 
impact 
egg 
supply 
and 
consumption 
in 
a 
particular 
period, 
as 
 occurred with the 2015 HPAI outbreak, 
the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly during 2020), and the most recent HPAI 
outbreak 
 starting in 
early 2022. 
According to 
the USDA s 
Economic Research 
Service, estimated 
annual per 
capita consumption 
in the 
 United States between 2018 
and 2022 varied, ranging from 279 to 292 eggs. In calendar year 2022, 
per capita U.S. consumption 
 was estimated to 
be 279 eggs, 
or approximately 5.4 
eggs per 
person per week. 
According to 
the USDA, 
the decline in 
consumption 
 was primarily 
due to limited 
availability caused 
by the outbreak 
of HPAI. 
As of July 
18, 2023, 
the USDA projects 
that the 
per 
 capita consumption 
will increase 
in calendar 
year 2023 
and 2024 
to 282.6 
and 292.7, 
respectively. 
The USDA 
calculates per 
 capita consumption by dividing 
total shell egg disappearance in the U.S. by the U.S. population. 

 Prices for Shell Eggs 
 Wholesale shell 
egg sales 
prices are 
a critical 
component of 
revenue for 
the Company. 
Wholesale shell 
egg prices 
are volatile, 
 cyclical, and impacted 
by a number 
of factors, including 
consumer demand, seasonal 
fluctuations, the number 
and productivity 
 of laying hens 
in the U.S. 
and outbreaks of 
agricultural diseases such 
as HPAI. 
While we use 
several different pricing mechanisms 
 in pricing 
agreements with 
our customers, 
we believe 
the majority 
of conventional 
shell eggs 
sold in 
the U.S. 
in the 
retail and 
 foodservice channels 
are sold 
at prices 
that take 
into account, 
in varying 
ways, independently 
quoted wholesale 
market prices, 
 such as those published 
by Urner Barry Publications, 
Inc. UB for shell 
eggs, however, grain-based and cost 
plus arrangements 
 are being 
utilized in 
the food 
service channel 
and some 
western markets. 
We 
sell the 
majority of 
our conventional 
shell eggs 
 based on formulas that take into account, in varying ways, independently 
quoted regional wholesale market prices for shell eggs 

5 
 or formulas related 
to our costs of production, 
which include the cost 
of corn and soybean 
meal. We 
do not sell eggs 
directly to 
 consumers or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers. 
 The weekly 
average price for 
the southeast region 
for large white 
conventional shell 
eggs as quoted 
by UB is 
shown below for 
 the past three 
fiscal years along 
with the five-year average 
price. As further 
discussed in 
 Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion 
 and Analysis Results of Operations 
 , conventional 
shell egg prices 
rose during 
the fourth quarter 
of fiscal 2022 
and first three 
 quarters of fiscal 
2023, due 
to the reduced 
supply related 
to the HPAI 
outbreak first 
detected in 
commercial flocks 
in February 
 2022, 
steady shell egg demand 
and higher production costs. Conventional shell 
egg prices continued to rise 
into the fourth quarter 
 of fiscal 2023 followed by a substantial decline, 
as demand for shell eggs began to decrease in line 
with typical seasonal variance 
 and as 
supply increased 
due to 
the repopulating 
of HPAI 
-affected 
layer flocks. 
The actual 
prices that 
we realize 
on any 
given 
 transaction will not necessarily equal quoted market prices because of 
the individualized terms that we negotiate with individual 
 customers which are influenced by many factors. Depending on market conditions, input costs 
and individualized 
contract terms, 
 the price we receive 
per dozen eggs in any 
given transaction may be 
more than or less than 
our farm production and 
other costs 
 per dozen. 
 Specialty eggs 
are typically 
sold at 
prices and 
terms negotiated 
directly with 
customers. Historically, 
prices for 
specialty eggs 
 have 
experienced 
less 
volatility 
than 
prices 
for 
conventional 
shell 
eggs 
and 
have 
generally 
been 
higher 
due 
to 
customer 
and 
 consumer willingness to pay more for specialty eggs. However, throughout most of 
fiscal 2023 conventional egg prices exceeded 
 specialty egg prices. Conventional 
egg prices generally respond 
more quickly to market conditions 
because we sell the majority 
 of our conventional 
shell eggs based on 
formulas that adjust periodically 
and take into account, 
in varying ways, independently 
 quoted regional wholesale market prices for shell eggs or 
formulas related to our costs of 
production. Because the majority of our 
 specialty eggs 
are typically 
sold at prices 
and terms negotiated 
directly with 
customers, specialty 
egg prices 
do not fluctuate 
as 
 much as conventional pricing. 
 Feed Costs for Shell Egg Production 
 Feed is a primary cost component in 
the production of shell eggs and 
represented 63.1 of our fiscal 2023 farm 
production costs. 
 We 
routinely fill 
our storage 
bins during 
harvest season 
when prices 
for feed 
ingredients, primarily 
corn and 
to a 
lesser extent 
 soybean meal, 
are generally 
lower. 
To 
ensure continued 
availability of 
feed ingredients, 
we may 
enter into 
contracts for 
future 
 purchases 
of 
corn 
and 
soybean meal, 
and 
as part 
of these 
contracts, 
we 
may 
lock-in 
the basis 
portion 
of our 
grain 
purchases 
 several months in advance. 
Basis is the difference between the local cash price for grain and the applicable futures price. A basis 

6 
 contract is a common transaction in the grain market that allows us to lock-in a basis level for a specific delivery period and wait 
 to set 
the futures 
price at 
a later 
date. Furthermore, 
due to 
the more 
limited supply 
for organic 
ingredients, 
we may 
commit to 
 purchase organic ingredients in advance to help assure supply. 
Ordinarily, we do not enter into long-term contracts beyond a year 
 to 
purchase 
corn 
and 
soybean 
meal 
or 
hedge 
against 
increases 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
corn 
and 
soybean 
meal. 
As 
the 
quality 
and 
 composition of feed is a critical factor in the nutritional value of shell eggs and health of our chickens, we formulate 
and produce 
 the vast 
majority of 
our own 
feed at 
our feed 
mills located 
near our 
production plants. 
Our annual 
feed requirements 
for fiscal 
 2023 were 2.0 million tons of finished 
feed, of which we manufactured 1.9 million 
tons. We currently 
have the capacity to store 
 182 thousand tons of corn and soybean meal, and we replenish these stores as needed 
throughout the year. 
 Our primary feed ingredients, corn 
and soybean meal, are commodities subject 
to volatile price changes due to 
weather, various 
 supply and 
demand factors, 
transportation and 
storage costs, 
speculators and 
agricultural, energy 
and trade 
policies in 
the U.S. 
 and internationally and most recently 
the Russia-Ukraine War. 
While we do not import corn 
or soy directly from the region, 
the 
 Russia-Ukraine War 
has had 
a negative 
impact on 
the worldwide 
supply of 
grain, including 
corn, putting 
upward pressure 
on 
 prices. 
We 
purchase 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
our 
corn 
and 
soybean 
meal 
from 
U.S 
sources 
but 
may 
be 
forced 
to 
purchase 
 internationally 
when 
U.S. 
supplies are 
not 
readily 
available. 
Feed 
grains 
are 
currently 
available 
from 
an 
adequate 
number 
of 
 sources in the U.S. As a point 
of reference, a multi-year comparison 
of the average of daily closing prices 
per Chicago Board of 
 Trade for each period in our fiscal calendar are 
shown below for corn and soybean meal: 
 Shell Egg Production 
 Our percentage of dozens produced to sold 
was 92.3 
of our total shell eggs sold in fiscal 2023, 
with 91.8 of such production 
 coming from company-owned facilities, 
and 8.2 from contract 
producers. Under a 
typical arrangement with 
a contract producer, 
 we 
own 
the 
flock, 
furnish 
all feed 
and 
critical 
supplies, 
own 
the 
shell 
eggs 
produced 
and 
assume 
market 
risks. 
The contract 
 producers own and operate their facilities and are paid a fee based on production 
with incentives for performance. 

 The commercial production of shell eggs requires a source of baby chicks for laying flock replacement. We hatch the majority of 
 our chicks in 
our own breeder 
farms and hatcheries 
in a 
computer-controlled environment and obtain 
the balance from 
commercial 
 sources. The chicks are grown in our own pullet farms and are placed into the laying 
flock once they reach maturity. 

7 
 After eggs are 
produced, they are 
cleaned, graded and 
packaged. Substantially all 
our farms have 
modern in-line facilities 
which 
 mechanically 
gather, 
clean, 
grade 
and 
package 
the 
eggs 
at 
the 
location 
where 
they 
are 
laid. 
The 
in-line 
facilities 
generate 
 significant efficiencies 
and cost 
savings compared 
to the 
cost of 
eggs produced 
from non-in-line 
facilities, which 
process eggs 
 that 
have 
been 
laid 
at 
another 
location 
and 
transported 
to the 
processing 
facility. 
The 
in-line 
facilities 
also 
produce 
a 
higher 
 percentage of USDA Grade A eggs, which sell at higher prices. Eggs 
produced on farms owned by contractors are brought to our 
 processing plants 
to be graded 
and packaged. 
Because shell eggs 
are perishable, 
we do not 
maintain large 
egg inventories. Our 
 egg 
inventory 
averaged 
six 
days 
of 
sales 
during 
fiscal 
2023. 
We 
believe 
our 
constant 
focus 
on 
production 
efficiencies 
and 
 automation throughout the supply chain enable us to be a low-cost supplier 
in our markets. 
 We 
are proud 
to have 
created and 
upheld 
what we 
believe is 
a leading 
poultry 
Animal Welfare 
Program AWP ). 
We 
have 
 aligned our AWP with 
regulatory, veterinary 
and our third-party certifying bodies guidance to govern welfare of 
animals in our 
 direct care, our contract farmers care and our farmer-suppliers 
care. We continually 
review our program to monitor and evolve 
 standards that guide how we hatch chicks, rear pullets and nurture 
breeder and layer hens. At each stage of 
our animals lives, we 
 are dedicated to providing welfare conditions aligned 
to our commitment to the principles of the internationally 
recognized 
 Five 
 Freedoms of Animal Welfare
 . Our standards apply to 
our enterprise and are 
tailored for our owned and 
contract grower operations 
 with oversights and approvals from senior members of our compliance team. 
 We 
do not 
use artificial 
hormones in 
the production 
of our 
eggs. Hormone 
use in 
the poultry 
and egg 
production industry 
has 
 been 
effectively 
banned 
in 
the U.S. 
since 
the 
1950s. 
We 
have 
an 
extensive 
written 
protocol 
that 
allows 
the 
use 
of 
medically 
 important 
antibiotics 
only 
when 
animal 
health 
is 
at 
risk, 
consistent 
with 
guidance 
from 
the 
United 
States 
Food 
and 
Drug 
 Administration FDA 
and 
the 
Guidance 
for 
Judicious 
Therapeutic 
Use 
of 
Antimicrobials 
in 
Poultry, 
developed 
by 
the 
 American Association of Avian Pathologists. When antibiotics are medically necessary, a licensed veterinary 
doctor will approve 
 and administer approved doses for a restricted period. Our programs are designed to ensure antibiotics are ordered and used only 
 when necessary and records of their usage when and where are maintained to monitor compliance with our protocols. We 
do 
 not use antibiotics for growth promotion or performance enhancement. 
 Specialty Eggs 
 We 
are 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
producers 
and 
marketers 
of 
value-added 
specialty 
shell 
eggs 
in 
the 
U.S., 
which 
continues 
to 
be 
a 
 significant and growing segment 
of the market. 
We classify cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and 
nutritionally 
 enhanced as specialty eggs for accounting and 
reporting purposes. Specialty eggs are intended to 
meet the demands of consumers 
 sensitive to environmental, health and/or animal welfare issues and 
to comply with state requirements for cage-free eggs. 

 As defined by the USDA, eggs packed in USDA grade 
marked consumer packages labeled as cage-free are 
laid by hens that are 
 able to roam vertically and horizontally in indoor houses and have access to fresh food and water. 
Cage-free systems must allow 
 hens to 
exhibit natural 
behaviors and 
include enrichments 
such as 
scratch areas, 
perches and 
nests. Hens 
must have 
access to 
 litter, protection from predators and be 
able to move in a barn in a manner that promotes bird welfare. 

 Ten 
states 
have 
passed 
legislation 
or 
regulations 
mandating 
minimum 
space 
or 
cage-free 
requirements 
for 
egg 
production 
or 
 mandated the sale of 
only cage-free eggs and 
egg products in 
their states, with implementation 
of these laws ranging 
from January 
 2022 to January 2026. These states represent approximately 27 of the U.S. total population according to the 2020 U.S. Census. 
 California, 
Massachusetts, and Colorado, which collectively represent approximately 16 of the total estimated 
U.S. population 
 have cage-free legislation in effect currently. 
In May 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld as 
constitutional California s law that 
 requires the sale of 
only cage-free eggs 
in that state and 
regardless of the state 
in which the eggs 
are produced. Although 
we do 
 not sell the majority of our eggs in these ten states, these state laws have impacted 
egg production practices nationally. 
 A significant number of our customers previously announced goals to 
offer cage-free eggs exclusively on or before 2026, subject 
 in most cases to availability of supply, 
affordability and consumer demand, among other contingencies. Some of these customers 
 have recently 
changed those 
goals to 
offer 70 
cage-free eggs 
by the 
end of 
2030. Our 
customers typically 
do not 
commit to 
 long-term purchases 
of specific quantities 
or types of 
eggs with us, 
and as a 
result, it is 
difficult to 
accurately predict 
customer 
 requirements for cage-free eggs. We are focused on adjusting our cage-free production capacity with a goal of meeting the future 
 needs of our customers in light of changing 
state requirements and our customer s 
goals. As always, we strive to offer a product 
 mix that aligns with current and anticipated customer purchase decisions. We are engaging with our customers to help them meet 
 their announced goals and needs. We have invested significant capital in 
recent years to acquire and construct 
cage-free facilities, 
 and we expect our focus for future expansion will continue 
to include cage-free facilities. Our volume of cage-free egg sales has 
 continued to increase and account for a larger share of our product mix. Cage-free sales represented approximately 20.1 of our 
 total net 
shell sales 
for 
fiscal 
year 
2023. 
At the 
same time, 
we understand 
the importance 
of our 
continued 
ability to 
provide 
 conventional eggs in order to provide our customers with a variety 
of egg choices and to address hunger in our communities.

 We are a member of the Eggland s 
Best, Inc. cooperative EB and produce, market, distribute and sell 
 Egg-Land s 
Best 
 
and 
 Land O 
Lakes 
 
branded eggs 
under license 
from EB at 
our facilities under 
EB guidelines. 
 Land O 
Lakes 
 
branded eggs 
are 
 produced by hens that are fed a 
whole-grain vegetarian diet. Our 
 Farmhouse Eggs
 brand eggs are produced at our 
facilities by 
 cage-free hens 
that are 
provided with 
a vegetarian 
diet. We 
market organic, 
vegetarian and 
omega-3 eggs 
under our 
 4-Grain 
 brand, which 
consists of 
conventional and 
cage-free eggs. 
We 
also produce, 
market and 
distribute private 
label specialty 
shell 
 eggs to several customers. 
 Egg Products 

 Egg products are shell eggs broken 
and sold in liquid, frozen, or 
dried form. We 
sell liquid and frozen egg products 
primarily to 
 the institutional, foodservice and food manufacturing sectors in the U.S. Our egg products are primarily 
sold through our wholly 
 owned subsidiaries American Egg Products, LLC located in Georgia 
and Texas Egg Products, LLC located 
in Texas. 
 During March 2023, 
MeadowCreek Food, 
LLC Meadowcreek ), 
a majority-owned subsidiary, 
began operations with 
a focus 
 on being a 
leading provider of 
hard-cooked eggs. We 
serve as the 
preferred provider to 
supply specialty and 
conventional eggs 
 that MeadowCreek 
needs to 
manufacture egg 
products. MeadowCreek s 
marketing plan 
is designed 
to extend 
our reach 
in the 
 foodservice and retail marketplace and bring 
new opportunities in the restaurant, 
institutional and industrial food products arenas.

 Marketing and Distribution 
 In fiscal 2023, we sold our shell eggs in 38 states through 
the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions 
 of the U.S. 
through our extensive 
distribution network 
to a diverse group 
of customers, including 
national and regional 
grocery 
 store chains, 
club stores, 
companies servicing 
independent supermarkets 
in the 
U.S., foodservice 
distributors and 
egg product 
 consumers. Some of 
our sales 
are completed through 
co-pack agreements 
a common practice 
in the 
industry whereby production 
 and 
processing of 
certain products 
are outsourced 
to another 
producer. 
Although we 
face intense 
competition 
from numerous 
 other companies, 
we believe 
that we 
have the 
largest market 
share for 
the sale 
of shell 
eggs in 
the grocery 
segment, including 
 large U.S. food retailers. 
 The majority of eggs sold are based on the daily 
or short-term needs of our customers. Most sales to established 
accounts are on 
 payment terms ranging from 
seven to 30 
days. Although we 
have established long-term relationships 
with many of 
our customers, 
 most of them are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources. 
 The shell eggs we 
sell are either delivered to 
our customers warehouse or retail 
stores, by our own 
fleet or contracted refrigerated 
 delivery trucks, or are picked up by our customers at our processing facilities. 
 We 
are a member 
of the Eggland s 
Best, Inc. cooperative 
and produce, market, 
distribute and 
sell 
 Egg-Land s 
Best 
 
and 
 Land 
 O Lakes 
 
branded eggs directly and through 
our joint ventures, Specialty 
Eggs, LLC and Southwest 
Specialty Eggs, LLC, under 
 exclusive 
license 
agreements 
in 
Alabama, 
Arizona, 
Florida, 
Georgia, 
Louisiana, 
Mississippi 
and 
Texas, 
and 
in 
portions 
of 
 Arkansas, California, 
Nevada, North 
Carolina, 
Oklahoma and 
South Carolina. 
We 
also have 
an exclusive 
license in New 
York 
 City in addition 
to exclusivity in 
select New York 
metropolitan areas, including 
areas within New 
Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
As 
 discussed above under Specialty Eggs, we also sell our own Farmhouse 
Eggs and 4Grain branded eggs.

 During 
2022, 
the 
Company 
joined 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
a 
new 
egg 
farmer 
cooperative 
in 
the 
western 
United 
States. 
ProEgg, 
 Inc.( ProEgg is comprised 
of leading egg production 
companies, including Cal-Maine 
Foods, servicing retail and 
foodservice 
 shell egg customers in 13 western states. ProEgg is a producer-owned 
cooperative organized under the Capper-Volstead 
Act. 

 The Company s 
top priority in joining 
as a member of 
ProEgg is serving 
our valued customers in 
this important market 
region. 
 Our 
membership 
in 
ProEgg 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
benefits 
for 
its 
customers, 
including 
supply 
chain 
stability 
and 
enhanced 
 reliability. Initially, 
Cal-Maine Foods customer relationships and customer support are expected to remain the same. We 
expect 
 that starting January 
1, 2024, each 
producer member 
will sell through 
ProEgg the 
shell eggs it 
produces for 
sale in the 
western 
 states covered by the cooperative. Customers will 
have a single point of 
contact for their shell egg 
purchases, as ProEgg will have 
 a dedicated team to market and sell the members combined egg production 
in the region. 
 Customers 
 Our top 
three customers 
accounted for 
an aggregate of 
50.1 , 45.9 
and 48.6 of 
net sales dollars 
for fiscal 2023 
, 
2022, and 
 2021, 
respectively. 
Our largest 
customer, 
Walmart 
Inc. (including 
Sam's Club), 
accounted for 
34.2 , 29.5 
and 29.8 
of net 
 sales dollars for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 In fiscal 2023, 
approximately 85.3 of 
our revenue related 
to sales to retail 
customers, 10.8 to 
sales to foodservice 
providers 
 and 3.9 
to egg products 
sales. Retail customers 
include primarily 
national and 
regional grocery 
store chains, 
club stores, and 
 companies 
servicing 
independent 
supermarkets 
in the 
U.S. Foodservice 
customers 
include 
primarily 
companies that 
sell food 
 products and related items to restaurants, healthcare and education facilities and 
hotels. 
 Competition 
 The production, processing, 
and distribution of shell 
eggs is an intensely 
competitive business, which 
has traditionally attracted 
 large numbers of 
producers in the United 
States. Shell egg competition 
is generally based on 
price, service and product 
quality. 
 The shell 
egg production 
industry remains 
highly fragmented. 
According to 
 Egg Industry 
Magazine
 , the 
ten largest 
producers 
 owned approximately 
53 of industry 
table egg layer 
hens at year-end 
2022 and 2021. 
We 
believe industry 
consolidation may 
 continue, 
and 
we 
plan 
to 
capitalize 
on 
opportunities 
as 
they 
arise. 
We 
believe 
further 
concentration 
could 
result 
in 
reduced 
 cyclicality of shell egg prices, but no assurance can be given in that regard. 
 Seasonality 
 Retail sales of shell eggs historically have been highest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months. 
 Prices for shell eggs fluctuate 
in response to seasonal demand 
factors and a natural 
increase in egg production during 
the spring 
 and early summer. 
Historically, 
shell egg prices tend 
to increase with the 
start of the school 
year and tend 
to be highest prior 
to 
 holiday 
periods, 
particularly 
Thanksgiving, 
Christmas 
and 
Easter. 
Consequently, 
and 
all 
other 
things 
being 
equal, 
we 
would 
 expect to experience 
lower selling prices, 
sales volumes and net 
income (and may 
incur net losses) in 
our first and 
fourth fiscal 
 quarters ending in August/September and May/June, respectively. Accordingly, we generally expect our need for 
working capital 
 to be highest during those quarters. 
 Growth Strategy 
 Our growth strategy is focused on remaining a 
low-cost provider of shell eggs located near 
our customers, offering our customers 
 choices 
that 
meet 
their 
requirements 
for 
eggs 
and 
egg 
products 
and 
continuing 
to 
grow 
our 
focus 
on 
specialty 
eggs 
and 
egg 
 products. For example, our 
recent investment in MeadowCreek, 
discussed under the heading 
 Egg Products above, is 
intended 
 to 
extend 
our 
reach 
in 
the 
foodservice 
and 
retail 
marketplace 
and 
bring 
new 
opportunities 
in 
the 
restaurant, 
institutional 
and 
 industrial food products arenas. 
 In light 
of the growing 
customer demand 
and increased 
legal requirements 
for cage-free 
eggs, we 
intend to 
continue to 
closely 
 evaluate the 
need to expand 
through selective acquisitions, 
with a priority 
on those that 
will facilitate our 
ability to expand 
our 
 cage-free shell 
egg production 
capabilities in 
key locations 
and markets. 
We 
will also 
continue to 
closely evaluate 
the need 
to 
 continue to expand and convert 
our own facilities to increase production 
of cage-free eggs based on 
a timeline designed to meet 
 the anticipated 
needs of 
our customers 
and comply 
with evolving 
legal requirements. 
As the 
ongoing 
production 
of cage-free 
 eggs 
is 
more 
costly 
than 
the 
production 
of 
conventional 
eggs, 
aligning 
our 
cage-free 
production 
capabilities 
with 
changing 
 demand for cage-free eggs is important to the success of our business. 

10 
 Trademarks 
and License Agreements 
 We own the trademarks 
 Farmhouse Eggs 
 , 
 Sunups 
 , 
 Sunny Meadow 
 
and 
 4Grain 
 . We produce and 
market 
 Egg-Land's Best
 
 and 
 Land O Lakes
 branded eggs under 
license agreements with 
EB. We 
believe these trademarks 
and license agreements 
are 
 important to our business. 

 Government Regulation 
 Our facilities and 
operations are subject 
to regulation by 
various federal, state, 
and local agencies, 
including, but not 
limited to, 
 the FDA, 
USDA, Environmental 
Protection 
Agency EPA), Occupational 
Safety and 
Health Administration 
("OSHA") and 
 corresponding state agencies or 
laws. The applicable regulations relate 
to grading, quality control, 
labeling, sanitary control and 
 reuse or 
disposal of 
waste. Our 
shell egg 
facilities are 
subject to 
periodic USDA, 
FDA, EPA 
and OSHA 
inspections. Our 
feed 
 production facilities are 
subject to FDA, 
EPA 
and OSHA regulation 
and inspections. We 
maintain our own 
inspection program 
 to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
our 
own 
standards 
and 
customer 
specifications. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
we 
will 
be 
required 
to 
incur 
 significant 
costs 
for 
compliance 
with 
such 
statutes 
and 
regulations. 
In 
the 
future, 
additional 
rules 
could 
be 
proposed 
that, 
if 
 adopted, could increase our costs. 
 Ten 
states 
have 
passed 
legislation 
or 
regulations 
mandating 
minimum 
space 
or 
cage-free 
requirements 
for 
egg 
production 
or 
 mandated the sale of 
only cage-free eggs and 
egg products in 
their states, with implementation 
of these laws ranging 
from January 
 2022 to January 2026. These states represent approximately 27 of the U.S. total population according to the 2020 U.S. Census. 
 California, 
Massachusetts, and Colorado, which collectively represent approximately 16 of the total estimated 
U.S. population 
 have cage-free legislation in effect currently. 
In May 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld as 
constitutional California s law that 
 requires the sale of only cage-free eggs in that state and regardless of the 
state in which the eggs are produced. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations 
 governing, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
generation, 
storage, 
handling, 
use, 
transportation, 
disposal, 
and 
remediation 
of 
hazardous 
 materials. Under these laws and regulations, we must obtain permits from governmental authorities, 
including, but not limited to, 
 wastewater discharge 
permits. We 
have made, and 
will continue to make, 
capital and other expenditures 
relating to compliance 
 with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permits. We are not currently aware of any major capital 
 expenditures 
necessary 
to 
comply 
with 
such 
laws 
and 
regulations; 
however, 
as 
environmental, 
health 
and 
safety 
laws 
and 
 regulations are becoming 
increasingly more stringent, 
including those relating to 
animal wastes and wastewater discharges, 
it is 
 possible that we will have to incur significant costs for compliance with such 
laws and regulations in the future. 
 Human Capital Resources 

As of June 3, 2023, we had 2,976 employees, of whom 2,305 worked in egg production, processing, 
and marketing, 207 worked 
 in 
feed 
mill operations 
and 464, including 
our 
executive officers, 
were 
administrative 
employees. Approximately 
5.4 of 
our 
 personnel 
are 
part-time, and we 
utilize 
temporary 
employment 
agencies 
and 
independent 
contractors 
to 
augment 
our 
 staffing needs when necessary. For fiscal 2023, the average monthly full-time 
equivalent for contingent workers was 
1,349. None 
 of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement. We consider 
our relations with employees to be good. 

 Culture and Values 

We 
are 
proud 
to 
be contributing corporate 
citizens 
where 
we live 
and 
work and to 
help create healthy, 
prosperous 
 communities. Our 
colleagues 
help 
us 
continue 
to 
enhance our community 
contributions, 
which are driven 
by 
 our longstanding culture that strives to promote an environment that upholds integrity and respect and provides opportunities for 
 each colleague to 
realize full potential. These 
commitments are encapsulated 
in the 
 Cal-Maine Foods Code 
of Ethics and 
Business 
 Conduct
 
and in our 
 Human Rights Statement
 . 

Health and Safety 

Our top priority is the 
health and safety of our 
employees, who continue to produce 
high-quality, 
affordable egg choices for 
our 
 customers and contribute to 
a stable food 
supply. Our enterprise safety committee 
comprises two corporate safety managers, 
eight 
 area compliance managers 
(three specifically for 
worker health 
and safety), 
55 local site 
compliance managers, feed 
mill managers 
 and general managers. 
The committee that 
oversees health and safety regularly reviews 
our written policies and 
changes to OSHA 
 regulation standards and shares information as it relates to outcomes from incidents in order to improve future performance. The 

11 
 committee s 
goals 
include 
working 
to 
help 
ensure 
that 
our 
engagements 
with 
our consumers, 
customers, 
and 
regulators 
 evidence our strong commitment to our workers health and safety. 

Our commitment to our colleagues health includes a strong 
commitment to on-site worker safety, 
including a focus on accident 
 prevention and life safety. 
Our Safety and Health Program 
is designed to promote best 
practices that help prevent 
and minimize 
 workplace accidents and illnesses. The scope of our Safety and 
Health Program applies to all enterprise colleagues. Additionally, 
 to 
help 
protect 
the health 
and well-being 
of 
our 
colleagues and 
people 
in our 
value 
chain, 
we 
require 
that any 
contractors 
or 
 vendors 
acknowledge 
and 
agree 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
guidelines 
governed 
by 
our 
Safety 
and 
Health 
Program. 
At 
each 
of 
our 
 locations, our general managers are expected to 
uphold and implement our Safety and Health Program in alignment 
with OSHA 
 requirements. We 
believe that 
this program, 
which is reviewed 
annually by 
our senior management 
team, contributes 
to strong 
 safety outcomes. As part of our 
Safety and Health Program, we conduct multi-lingual training that 
covers topics such as slip-and-
 fall avoidance, respiratory protection, prevention of 
hazardous communication of chemicals, the 
proper use of personal 
protective 
 equipment, hearing 
conservation, emergency 
response, lockout 
and tagout 
of equipment 
and forklift 
safety, 
among others. 
We 
 have 
also 
installed dry 
hydrogen 
peroxide biodefense 
systems 
in 
our 
processing 
facilities 
to 
help 
protect 
our 
colleagues 
 respiratory health. To help drive 
our focus on 
colleague safety, we developed safety 
committees at each 
of our sites 
with employee 
 representation from each department. 

 We 
review 
the success 
of our 
safety programs 
on a 
monthly basis 
to monitor 
their effectiveness 
and 
the development 
of any 
 trends that need to 
be addressed. During fiscal 
year 2023 
our recordable incident rates 
decreased by 29 compared to 
fiscal 2022. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

Our 
culture seeks 
to 
embrace the 
diversity 
and 
inclusion 
of 
all 
our 
team 
members. 
This 
culture is driven 
by 
our 
board 
and 
 executive management team. Our board comprises seven members, four of 
whom are independent. Women comprise 29 of our 
 board and 14 of our 
board members identify as a 
racial or ethnic 
minority. As 
of June 3, 2023, 
our total workforce comprised 
 29 women and 53 
of colleagues who 
identify as racial or 
ethnic minorities. Our Policy 
against Harassment, Discrimination, 
 Unlawful 
or 
Unethical 
Conduct 
and 
Retaliation; 
Reporting 
Procedure affirms 
our 
commitment 
to 
supporting 
our 
employees 
 regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin or any other basis protected by applicable law. 

Cal-Maine Foods strives 
to ensure that 
our colleagues are 
treated equitably. We are an Equal 
Opportunity Employer that prohibits, 
 by policy and practice, 
any violation of applicable 
federal, state, or local 
law regarding employment. 
Discrimination because of 
 race, color, religion, 
sex, pregnancy, age, 
national origin, citizenship status, veteran 
status, physical or mental disability, 
genetic 
 information, or any other basis protected by applicable law 
is prohibited. We value diversity in our workplaces or in 
work-related 
 situations. We maintain 
strong protocols to help our colleagues perform 
their jobs free from harassment and discrimination. Our 
 focus 
on 
equitable 
treatment 
extends 
to 
recruitment, 
employment 
applications, 
hiring, 
placement, 
job 
assignments, 
career 
 development, training, remuneration, 
benefits, discharge 
and other matters 
tied to terms and 
conditions of employment. 
We 
are 
 committed 
to 
offering 
our 
colleagues 
opportunities 
commensurate 
with 
our 
operational 
needs, 
their 
experiences, 
goals 
and 
 contributions. 

Recruitment, Development and Retention 

We 
believe 
in compensating 
our 
colleagues 
with 
fair 
and competitive wages, in 
addition 
to offering 
 competitive benefits. Approximately 76 of our employees 
are paid at hourly rates, which are all paid at rates above 
the federal 
 minimum 
wage 
requirement. 
We 
offer 
our 
full-time 
eligible 
employees 
a 
range 
of 
benefits, 
including 
company-paid 
life 
 insurance. The Company provides a comprehensive self-insured health plan and pays approximately 84 of the costs of the plan 
 for 
participating 
employees 
and 
their 
families 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022. Recent 
benchmarking 
of 
our health 
plan 
 indicates comparable 
benefits, at 
lower 
employee contributions, when compared 
to an applicable 
Agriculture 
and 
 Food Manufacturing sector grouping, as well as peer group data. 
In addition, we offer employees the opportunity to purchase an 
 extensive range of other group 
plan benefits, such as dental, vision, 
accident, critical illness, disability 
and voluntary life. 
After 
 one 
year 
of 
employment, full-time employees 
who 
meet 
eligibility 
requirements may 
elect 
to participate 
in 
our 
 KSOP retirement plan, 
which 
offers 
a 
range 
of 
investment 
alternatives 
and 
includes 
many positive features, 
such 
as 
 automatic enrollment with scheduled 
automatic contribution 
increases and loan 
provisions. Regardless of 
the 
 employees elections 
to contribute 
to 
the 
KSOP, 
the 
Company contributes shares 
of Company 
stock or 
cash 
equivalent 
to 3 
 of participants eligible compensation for each pay period that hours 
are worked. 

We 
 provide 
extensive 
training 
and 
development related 
to 
safety, 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
task 
training. 
 We 
 invest 
in 
 developing our future leaders through our Management Intern, Management 
Trainee and informal mentoring programs. 

12 
 Sustainability 
 We understand that climate, and 
the potential consequences of climate change, freshwater availability and preservation of global 
 biodiversity, in addition to 
responsible management of 
our flocks, are 
vital to 
the production of 
high-quality eggs and 
egg products 
 and to the success of our 
Company. We have engaged in agricultural production for 
more than 60 
years. Our agricultural practices 
 continue to evolve as we continue to strive to meet the need for nutritious, affordable foods to feed a growing population even as 
 we exercise responsible 
natural resource stewardship. We plan to publish our most recent sustainability report on or around early 
 August 2023, which 
will be available 
on our website.

 ITEM 1A. 
RISK FACTORS 
 Our 
business 
and 
results 
of 
operations 
are 
subject 
to 
numerous 
risks 
and 
uncertainties, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
beyond 
our 
 control. The following is a description of the known factors that may materially affect 
our business, financial condition or results 
 of operations. They 
should be considered 
carefully, 
in addition 
to the information 
set forth 
elsewhere in 
this Annual 
Report on 
 Form 
10-K, 
including 
under 
Part 
II. 
Item 7. 
Management s 
Discussion 
and 
Analysis 
of 
Financial 
Condition 
and 
Results 
of 
 Operations, 
in 
making 
any 
investment 
decisions 
with 
respect 
to 
our 
securities. Additional 
risks 
or 
uncertainties 
that 
are 
not 
 currently known 
to us, 
or that we 
are aware 
of but 
currently deem 
to be 
immaterial or 
that could 
apply to 
any company 
could 
 also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results 
of operations. 
 INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS 
 Market prices 
of wholesale 
shell eggs 
are volatile, 
and decreases 
in these 
prices can 
adversely impact 
our revenues 
and 
 profits. 
 Our operating results are significantly 
affected by wholesale shell egg 
market prices, which fluctuate widely and 
are outside our 
 control. As 
a result, 
our prior 
performance 
should not 
be presumed 
to be 
an accurate 
indication of 
future performance. 
Under 
 certain circumstances, small increases 
in production, or small 
decreases in demand, within 
the industry might 
have a large adverse 
 effect on shell egg prices. Low shell egg prices adversely affect 
our revenues and profits. 
 Market prices for 
wholesale shell eggs 
have been volatile 
and cyclical. Shell 
egg prices have 
risen in the 
past during periods 
of 
 high demand such as the initial outbreak of 
the COVID-19 pandemic and periods when high protein 
diets are popular. Shell egg 
 prices 
have 
also 
risen 
during 
periods 
of 
constrained 
supply, 
such 
as 
the 
latest 
highly 
pathogenic 
avian 
influenza HPAI 
 outbreak 
that was 
first detected 
in domestic 
commercial flocks 
in February 
2022. During 
times when 
prices are 
high, the 
egg 
 industry 
has 
typically 
geared 
up 
to 
produce 
more 
eggs, 
primarily 
by 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
layers, 
which 
historically 
has 
 ultimately resulted in an oversupply of eggs, leading to a period of lower prices. 

 As discussed 
above in 
 Part I. Item 1. Business Seasonality 
 , seasonal fluctuations 
impact shell 
egg prices. Therefore, 
comparisons 
 of 
our 
sales 
and 
operating 
results 
between 
different 
quarters 
within 
a 
single 
fiscal 
year 
are 
not 
necessarily 
meaningful 
 comparisons. 
 A decline in consumer demand for shell eggs can negatively impact our business. 
 We believe the 
increase in meals prepared at home due 
to concerns and restrictions during the initial outbreak 
of the COVID-19 
 pandemic, 
high-protein 
diet 
trends, 
industry 
advertising 
campaigns 
and 
the 
improved 
nutritional 
reputation 
of 
eggs 
have 
all 
 contributed 
at one 
time or 
another 
to increased 
shell egg 
demand. However, 
it is 
possible that 
the demand 
for shell 
eggs will 
 decline in the future. Adverse publicity relating to health or safety 
concerns and changes in the perception of the nutritional 
value 
 of shell eggs, changes in consumer 
views regarding consumption of animal-based products, as 
well as movement away from high 
 protein diets, could 
adversely affect 
demand for shell 
eggs, which would 
have a material 
adverse effect 
on our future 
results of 
 operations and financial condition. 

13 
 Feed costs are volatile and increases in these costs can 
adversely impact our results of operations. 
 Feed costs are the largest element of our shell 
egg (farm) production cost, ranging from 55 
to 63 of total farm production cost 
 in the last five fiscal years. 

 Although feed ingredients, primarily corn and soybean 
meal, are available from a 
number of sources, we do not 
have control over 
 the prices 
of the 
ingredients we 
purchase, which 
are affected 
by weather, 
various global 
and U.S. 
supply and 
demand factors, 
 transportation 
and storage 
costs, speculators, 
and 
agricultural, energy 
and trade 
policies in 
the U.S. 
and 
internationally. 
More 
 recently, 
the Russia-Ukraine 
War 
has had 
a negative 
impact on 
the worldwide 
supply of grain, 
including corn, 
putting upward 
 pressure on 
prices. We 
saw increasing 
prices for 
corn and 
soybean meal 
for fiscal 
years 2022 
and 2023 
as a 
result of 
weather-
 related shortfalls 
in production 
and yields, ongoing 
supply chain disruptions 
and the Russia-Ukraine 
War 
and its impact 
on the 
 export markets. 
Our costs for 
corn and 
soybean meal are 
also affected 
by local basis 
prices. Factors that 
can affect 
basis levels 
 include transportation 
and storage costs. We 
saw basis levels 
increase in our 
areas of operation 
during fiscal 2023 
as a result of 
 higher transportation and storage costs, resulting in higher farm production 
costs during the year. 
 Increases in feed 
costs unaccompanied by increases 
in the selling price 
of eggs can have 
a material adverse effect 
on the results 
 of our operations and cash flow. Alternatively, low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction, possibly resulting in lower 
 egg prices and lower revenue.

Agricultural risks, including outbreaks of avian 
disease, could harm our business. 

 Our shell egg 
production activities are 
subject to a variety 
of agricultural risks. 
Unusual or extreme 
weather conditions, disease 
 and pests can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of shell eggs 
we produce and distribute. Outbreaks of avian 
 influenza among poultry occur 
periodically worldwide and have occurred 
sporadically in the U.S. Most recently, 
an outbreak of 
 HPAI, 
which was first detected 
in February 2022, 
has impacted the 
industry. 
Prior to 2022, there 
was another significant 
HPAI 
 outbreak in the U.S. impacting poultry during 2015. There have been no positive tests for HPAI 
at any Cal-Maine Foods owned 
 or contracted facility as 
of July 25, 
2023. The Company maintains 
controls and procedures designed 
to reduce the 
risk of exposing 
 our flocks to harmful 
diseases; however, despite these efforts, outbreaks of avian 
disease can and do 
still occur and may 
adversely 
 impact the 
health of 
our flocks. 
An outbreak 
of avian 
disease could 
have a 
material adverse 
impact on 
our financial 
results by 
 increasing 
government 
restrictions 
on 
the 
sale 
and 
distribution 
of 
our 
products 
and 
requiring 
us 
to 
euthanize 
the 
affected 
 layers. Negative publicity from an outbreak within our 
industry can negatively impact customer perception, even if 
the outbreak 
 does 
not 
directly 
impact 
our flocks. 
If 
a 
substantial portion 
of 
our 
layers 
or production 
facilities are 
affected 
by 
any 
of these 
 factors in any given quarter or year, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely 
 affected. 
 Shell 
eggs 
and 
shell 
egg 
products 
are 
susceptible 
to 
microbial 
contamination, 
and 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to, 
or we 
may 
 voluntarily, recall 
contaminated products. 
 Shell eggs 
and shell 
egg products 
are vulnerable 
to contamination 
by pathogens 
such as 
Salmonella. The 
Company maintains 
 policies and procedures designed to comply with the complex rules and regulations governing egg production, such as The Final 
 Egg 
Rule 
issued 
by 
the 
FDA 
 Prevention 
of 
Salmonella 
Enteritidis 
in 
Shell 
Eggs 
During 
Production, 
Storage, 
and 
 Transportation, and 
the FDA s 
Food Safety Modernization Act. Shipment 
of contaminated products, even 
if inadvertent, could 
 result in a 
violation of law and 
lead to increased 
risk of exposure 
to product liability 
claims, product recalls 
and scrutiny by federal 
 and 
state 
regulatory 
agencies. 
We 
have 
little, 
if 
any, 
control 
over 
proper 
handling 
once 
the 
product 
has 
been 
shipped 
or 
 delivered. In 
addition, 
products 
purchased 
from 
other 
producers 
could 
contain 
contaminants 
that 
might 
be 
inadvertently 
 redistributed by us. As such, we might decide or be required 
to recall a product if we, our customers 
or regulators believe it poses 
 a potential 
health risk. 
Any product 
recall could 
result in 
a loss 
of consumer 
confidence in 
our products, 
adversely affect 
our 
 reputation 
with existing 
and potential 
customers and 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on our 
business, results 
of operations 
and 
 financial condition. We 
currently maintain insurance 
with respect to certain of 
these risks, including product 
liability insurance, 
 business interruption insurance and general liability 
insurance, but in many cases such insurance is expensive, 
difficult to obtain 
 and no assurance can 
be given that such insurance 
can be maintained in 
the future on acceptable 
terms, or in sufficient 
amounts 
 to protect us against losses due to any such events, or at all. 
 Our profitability 
may be adversely 
impacted by 
increases in other 
input costs such 
as packaging materials 
and delivery 
 expenses, including as a result of inflation.
 In addition to feed ingredient costs, other significant input costs include costs of packaging materials and delivery expenses. Our 
 costs of packing materials increased 
during fiscal 2023 and 2022 
due to rising inflation and labor 
costs, and during 2022 also as 
 a 
result 
of 
supply 
chain 
constraints 
initially 
caused 
by 
the 
pandemic, 
and 
these 
costs 
may 
continue 
to 
increase. 
We 
also 

14 
 experienced increases in delivery expenses during fiscal 2023 and 2022 due to increases in fuel and labor costs for both our fleet 
 and contract 
trucking, and 
these costs 
may continue 
to increase. 
Increases in 
these costs 
are largely 
outside of 
our control 
and 
 have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. 
 BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL 
RISK FACTORS 
 Global 
or 
regional 
health 
crises including 
pandemics 
or 
epidemics 
could 
have 
an 
adverse impact 
on 
our 
business and 
 operations. 
 The 
effects 
of 
global 
or 
regional 
pandemics 
or 
epidemics 
can 
significantly 
impact 
our 
operations. 
Although 
demand 
for 
our 
 products could 
increase as 
a result 
of restrictions 
such as 
travel bans 
and restrictions, 
quarantines, shelter-in-place 
orders, and 
 business and government shutdowns, 
which can prompt more 
consumers to eat at home, 
these restrictions could also significantly 
 increase our cost of doing business 
due to labor shortages, supply-chain disruptions, increased costs and decreased availability of 
 packaging supplies, and increased 
medical and other costs. 
We experienced these impacts as a 
result of the COVID-19 
pandemic, 
 primarily during our fiscal 
years 2020 and 2021. 
The pandemic recovery also 
contributed to increasing inflation 
and interest rates, 
 which persist and 
may continue 
to persist. The 
impacts of health 
crises are difficult 
to predict and 
depend on numerous 
factors 
 including 
the 
severity, 
length and 
geographic 
scope 
of 
the outbreak, 
resurgences 
of 
the disease 
and 
variants, 
availability 
and 
 acceptance of vaccines, and 
governmental, business and individuals 
responses. 
A resurgence of 
COVID-19 and/or variants, or 
 any future major public health crisis, would disrupt our 
business and could have a material adverse effect on 
our financial results. 
 Our acquisition growth strategy subjects us to various risks. 
 As discussed in 
 Part I. Item I. Business Growth Strategy 
 , we plan 
to pursue a 
growth strategy that includes 
selective acquisitions 
 of other 
companies engaged 
in the 
production and 
sale of 
shell eggs, 
with a 
priority on 
those that 
will facilitate 
our ability 
to 
 expand our cage-free shell egg production capabilities in key locations and markets. We may over-estimate or under-estimate the 
 demand 
for 
cage-free 
eggs, 
which 
could 
cause 
our 
acquisition 
strategy 
to 
be 
less-than-optimal 
for 
our 
future 
growth 
and 
 profitability. 
The 
number 
of existing 
companies 
with 
cage-free 
capacity 
that 
we 
may 
be 
able 
to 
purchase 
is 
limited, 
as 
most 
 production of shell 
eggs by other companies 
in our markets currently 
does not meet customer 
demands or legal requirements 
to 
 be designated 
as cage-free. 
Conversely, 
if we 
acquire cage-free 
production capacity, 
which is 
more expensive 
to purchase 
and 
 operate, and customer 
demands or legal 
requirements for cage-free 
eggs were to change, 
the resulting lack 
of demand for 
cage-
 free eggs may result in higher costs and lower profitability. 
 Acquisitions require capital resources and can divert management s attention from our existing business. Acquisitions also entail 
 an inherent risk that we 
could become subject to contingent or 
other liabilities, including liabilities arising from 
events or conduct 
 prior to 
our acquisition 
of a 
business that 
were unknown 
to us 
at the 
time of 
acquisition. We 
could incur 
significantly greater 
 expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we anticipated at the 
time of its purchase. 
 We cannot assure 
you that we: 
 
 will identify suitable acquisition candidates; 
 
 can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms; 
 
 can successfully integrate an acquired business into our operations; or 
 
 can successfully manage the operations of an acquired business. 
 No 
assurance 
can 
be 
given 
that 
companies 
we 
acquire 
in 
the 
future 
will 
contribute 
positively 
to 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
 financial condition. 
In addition, 
federal antitrust 
laws require 
regulatory approval 
of acquisitions 
that exceed 
certain threshold 
 levels of significance, and we cannot guarantee that such approvals would 
be obtained. 
 The consideration 
we pay in 
connection with any 
acquisition affects 
our financial results. 
If we pay 
cash, we could 
be required 
 to 
use 
a 
portion 
of 
our 
available 
cash 
or 
credit 
facility 
to 
consummate 
the 
acquisition. 
To 
the 
extent 
we 
issue 
shares 
of 
our 
 Common Stock, existing stockholders may 
be diluted. In addition, 
acquisitions may result in 
additional debt. Our ability to 
access 
 any additional 
capital that 
may be 
needed for 
an acquisition 
may be 
adversely impacted 
by higher 
interest rates 
and economic 
 uncertainty. 
 Our largest customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales volume. Accordingly, our business may be 
 adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced purchases by, 
one or more of our large customers. 
 Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs 
and food distributors, have continued to consolidate and consolidation 
is 
 expected to continue. These consolidations have 
produced larger customers and potential customers with 
increased buying power 
 who are more 
capable of operating 
with reduced inventories, 
opposing price increases, 
and demanding lower 
pricing, increased 

15 
 promotional programs and specifically tailored products. Because of these trends, 
our volume growth could slow or we 
may need 
 to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products, any of 
which could adversely affect our financial results.

Our top 
three customers 
accounted for 
an aggregate of 
50.1 , 45.9 
and 48.6 of 
net sales dollars 
for fiscal 202 
3, 2022, 
and 
 2021, respectively. 
Our largest 
customer, 
Walmart 
Inc. (including 
Sam's Club), 
accounted for 
34.2 , 29.5 
and 29.8 
of net 
 sales dollars 
for fiscal 
2023, 2022, 
and 2021, 
respectively. Although 
we have 
established long-term 
relationships with 
most of 
 our customers 
who continue 
to purchase 
from us 
based on 
our ability 
to service 
their needs, 
they are 
generally free 
to acquire 
 shell eggs 
from other 
sources. If, for 
any reason, one 
or more 
of our 
large customers 
were to 
purchase significantly 
less of 
our 
 shell eggs 
in the 
future or 
terminate their 
purchases from 
us, and 
we were 
not able 
to sell 
our shell 
eggs to 
new customers 
at 
 comparable levels, it would have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our business is highly competitive. 
 The 
production 
and 
sale 
of 
fresh 
shell 
eggs, 
which 
accounted 
for 
virtually 
all 
of 
our 
net 
sales 
in 
recent 
years, 
is 
intensely 
 competitive. We 
compete with 
a large 
number of 
competitors that 
may prove 
to be 
more successful 
than we 
are in 
producing, 
 marketing and 
selling shell 
eggs. We 
cannot provide 
assurance that 
we will 
be able 
to compete 
successfully with 
any or 
all of 
 these companies. 
Increased competition could result in price reductions, 
greater cyclicality, reduced 
margins and loss of market 
 share, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations, 
and financial condition. 
 We 
are 
dependent 
on 
our 
management 
team, 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
any 
key 
member 
of 
this 
team 
may 
adversely 
affect 
the 
 implementation of our business plan in a timely manner. 
 Our success 
depends largely 
upon the 
continued service 
of our 
senior management 
team. The 
loss or interruption 
of service 
of 
 one or more 
of our key 
executive officers 
could adversely 
affect our 
ability to manage 
our operations effectively 
and/or pursue 
 our growth strategy. 
We 
have not entered 
into any employment 
or non-compete 
agreements with any 
of our executive 
officers. 
 Competition could cause us to lose talented employees, and unplanned turnover could deplete institutional 
knowledge and result 
 in increased costs due to increased competition for employees. 

 Our 
business 
is 
dependent 
on 
our 
information 
technology 
systems 
and 
software, 
and 
failure 
to 
protect 
against 
or 
 effectively respond to 
cyber-attacks, security 
breaches, or other 
incidents involving those systems, 
could adversely affect 
 day-to-day operations and decision making processes and 
have an adverse effect on our performance and reputation. 
 The efficient operation of our business depends on our 
information technology systems, which we rely on to effectively manage 
 our business data, communications, logistics, accounting, regulatory 
and other business processes. If we do not allocate and 
 effectively manage the resources necessary to build 
and sustain an appropriate technology environment, our business, 
 reputation, or financial results could be negatively impacted. In 
addition, our information technology systems may be 
 vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, 
including systems failures, natural disasters, 
 terrorist attacks, viruses, ransomware, security breaches or cyber 
incidents. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and 
 are increasing in the number of attempts and frequency by groups and individuals 
with a wide range of motives. We 
have 
 experienced and expect to continue to experience attempted cyber-attacks 
of our information technology systems or networks. 

 A security breach 
of 
sensitive 
information 
could 
result 
in 
damage 
to 
our 
reputation 
and 
our 
relations 
with 
our 
customers 
or 
 employees. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse 
effect on our business. 

 Technology 
and business and regulatory requirements continue to change rapidly. 
Failure to update or replace legacy systems to 
 address 
these 
changes 
could 
result 
in 
increased 
costs, 
including 
remediation 
costs, 
system 
downtime, 
third 
party 
litigation, 
 regulatory actions or cyber security vulnerabilities which could have 
a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Labor shortages or increases in labor costs could adversely 
impact our business and results of operations. 
 Labor is a primary component of our farm production costs. Our success is dependent 
upon recruiting, motivating, and retaining 
 staff to operate our farms. Approximately 76 of our employees are paid at hourly rates, often in entry-level positions. While all 
 our employees are paid at 
rates above the federal minimum wage 
requirements, any significant increase 
in local, state or federal 
 minimum wage requirements could 
increase our labor 
costs. In addition, 
any regulatory changes 
requiring us to 
provide additional 
 employee 
benefits 
or 
mandating 
increases 
in 
other 
employee-related 
costs, 
such 
as 
unemployment 
insurance 
or 
workers 
 compensation, would increase our 
costs. A shortage 
in the labor 
pool, which may be 
caused by competition from 
other employers, 
 the remote 
locations of 
many of 
our farms, 
decreased 
labor participation 
rates or 
changes in 
government-provided 
support or 
 immigration laws, particularly in times of lower unemployment, 
could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 A 
 shortage of labor 
available to 
us could 
cause our 
farms to 
operate with 
reduced staff, which 
could negatively impact 
our production 
 capacity and efficiencies. 
In fiscal 2021 and 2022, our labor costs increased primarily due to the pandemic 
and its effects, which 

16 
 caused us to 
increase wages in 
response to labor shortages. 
In fiscal 2023, 
labor wages continued to 
rise due to 
increasing inflation 
 and low unemployment. 
Accordingly, any significant labor shortages or increases 
in our labor costs 
could have a material 
adverse 
 effect on our results of operations. 
 We are controlled by the family of our late founder, Fred 
R. Adams, Jr., and Adolphus B. Baker, 
Chairman of our Board 
 of Directors, 
controls the vote of 100 of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.
 Fred R. Adams, 
Jr., our 
Founder and Chairman Emeritus 
died on March 29, 
2020. Mr. 
Adams son-in-law, 
Adolphus B. Baker, 
 Chairman 
of 
our 
board 
of 
directors, 
Mr. 
Baker s 
spouse 
and 
her 
three 
sisters 
(Mr. 
Adams 
four 
daughters) 
(collectively, 
the 
 Family 
beneficially 
own, 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
through 
related 
entities, 
100 
of 
our 
outstanding 
Class 
A 
Common 
Stock 
 (which has 
10 votes 
per share), 
controlling approximately 
52.1 of 
our total 
voting power. 
Such persons 
also have 
additional 
 voting power 
due to 
beneficial ownership 
of our 
Common Stock 
(which has 
one vote 
per share), 
directly or 
indirectly through 
 related entities, resulting in family voting control of approximately 53.8 of our total voting power. 
Mr. Baker controls the vote 
 of 100 of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. 
 We understand that the Family 
intends 
to retain ownership 
of a 
sufficient amount of our 
Common Stock and 
our Class A 
Common 
 Stock to assure continued ownership of more than 50 of the voting power of 
our outstanding shares of capital stock. As a result 
 of 
this ownership, 
the 
Family has 
the 
ability 
to exert 
substantial 
influence 
over 
matters requiring 
action 
by our 
stockholders, 
 including 
amendments 
to our 
certificate 
of incorporation 
and by-laws, 
the election 
and removal 
of directors, 
and any 
merger, 
 consolidation, 
or 
sale of 
all or 
substantially 
all of 
our 
assets, 
or 
other 
corporate 
transactions. 
Delaware 
law 
provides 
that 
the 
 holders of a majority of the voting power of shares entitled to vote must approve certain fundamental corporate transactions such 
 as a merger, 
consolidation and sale of 
all or substantially all 
of a corporation s 
assets; accordingly, 
such a transaction involving 
 us 
and 
requiring 
stockholder 
approval 
cannot 
be 
effected 
without 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Family. 
Such 
ownership 
will 
make 
an 
 unsolicited acquisition of our Company more difficult and discourage 
certain types of transactions involving a change of control 
 of our Company, including 
transactions in which the holders of our Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their 
 shares over then current market prices. 
The Family s controlling 
ownership of our capital stock may adversely 
affect the market 
 price of our Common Stock. 
 The 
price 
of 
our 
Common 
Stock 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
availability 
of 
shares 
for 
sale 
in 
the 
market, 
and 
you 
may 
 experience significant dilution as a result of future issuances 
of our securities, which could materially and adversely 
affect 
 the market price of our Common Stock.
 The sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Common Stock could adversely impact its price. 
The Family holds 
 approximately 1.4 million shares of Common Stock (the Subject Shares that are subject to an Agreement Regarding Common 
 Stock 
(the 
 Agreement 
filed 
as 
an 
exhibit 
to 
this 
report. 
The 
Subject 
Shares 
remain 
subject 
to 
potential 
sale 
under 
the 
 Agreement. The Agreement 
generally provides that 
if a holder 
of Subject Shares 
intends to sell any 
of the Subject 
Shares, such 
 party must give the 
Company a right of first 
refusal to purchase all or 
any of such shares. 
The price payable by 
the Company to 
 purchase shares 
pursuant to 
the exercise 
of the 
right of 
first refusal 
will reflect 
a 6 
discount to 
the then-current 
market price 
 based 
on 
the 
20 
business-day 
volume-weighted 
average 
price. 
If 
the 
Company 
does 
not exercise 
its right 
of 
first 
refusal 
and 
 purchase the shares offered, such party will, subject to the approval of a special committee of independent 
directors of the Board 
 of Directors, be 
permitted to sell 
the shares not 
purchased by the 
Company pursuant to 
a Company registration 
statement, Rule 
 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, or another manner of sale agreed to by the Company. Although 
pursuant to the Agreement 
 the Company 
will have a 
right of first 
refusal to purchase 
all or any 
of those shares, 
the Company 
may elect not 
to exercise its 
 rights 
of 
first 
refusal, 
and 
if so 
such 
shares 
would 
be 
eligible for 
sale pursuant 
to 
the registration 
rights 
in 
the 
Agreement 
or 
 pursuant 
to 
Rule 
144 
under 
the Securities 
Act 
of 
1933. 
Sales, or 
the 
availability 
for 
sale, of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
shares of 
our 
 Common Stock could result in a decline in the market price of our 
Common Stock. 
 In addition, 
our articles 
of incorporation 
authorize us 
to issue 
120,000,000 shares 
of our 
Common Stock. 
As of 
June 3, 
2023, 
 there were 
44,184,048 shares 
of our 
Common Stock 
outstanding. Accordingly, 
a substantial 
number of 
shares of 
our Common 
 Stock 
are 
outstanding 
and 
are, 
or 
could 
become, 
available 
for 
sale 
in 
the 
market. 
In 
addition, 
we 
may 
be 
obligated 
to 
issue 
 additional shares of our Common Stock in connection with employee benefit 
plans (including equity incentive plans). 
 In the 
future, we 
may decide 
to raise 
capital through 
offerings of 
our Common 
Stock, additional 
securities convertible 
into or 
 exchangeable for 
Common Stock, or 
rights to acquire 
these securities or 
our Common Stock. 
The issuance of 
additional shares 
 of our Common Stock or additional securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock could result in dilution of 
 existing stockholders equity interests in 
us. Issuances of substantial amounts of 
our Common Stock, or the perception 
that such 
 issuances could 
occur, 
may adversely 
affect prevailing 
market prices 
for our 
Common Stock, 
and we 
cannot predict 
the effect 
 this dilution may have on the price of our Common Stock. 

17 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
RISK FACTORS 
 Pressure from animal rights groups regarding the treatment of animals may subject us to additional costs to conform our 
 practices 
to 
comply 
with 
developing 
standards 
or 
subject 
us 
to 
marketing 
costs 
to 
defend 
challenges 
to 
our 
current 
 practices and protect 
our image with 
our customers. In 
particular, 
changes in customer 
preferences and 
new legislation 
 have accelerated an increase in demand for cage-free eggs, which increases uncertainty 
in our business and increases our 
 costs. 
 We and many of our customers face pressure from animal rights groups, such as 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and 
 the Humane 
Society of 
the United States, 
to require 
companies that supply 
food products 
to operate 
their business in 
a manner 
 that 
treats 
animals 
in 
conformity 
with 
certain 
standards 
developed 
or 
approved 
by 
these 
groups. 
In 
general, 
we 
may 
incur 
 additional costs to conform our practices to address 
these standards or to defend our existing 
practices and protect our image with 
 our customers. 
The standards promoted 
by these groups 
change over time, 
but typically 
require minimum 
cage space 
for hens, 
 among other requirements, and some 
of these groups have led successful 
legislative efforts to ban 
any form of caged housing 
in 
 various states. 

 As 
discussed 
in 
 Part I. Item 1. Business - Government Regulation 
 , 
ten 
states 
have 
passed 
minimum 
space 
and/or 
cage-free 
 requirements 
for 
hens, 
and 
other 
states are 
considering 
such requirements. 
In 
addition, 
in recent 
years, 
many 
large 
restaurant 
 chains, 
foodservice 
companies 
and 
grocery 
chains, 
including 
our 
largest 
customers, 
announced 
goals 
to 
transition 
to 
an 
 exclusively cage-free 
egg supply 
chain by specified 
future dates. 
A significant 
number of 
our customers 
previously announced 
 goals to offer cage-free eggs exclusively on or before 2026, in most cases subject to available supply, affordability and consumer 
 demand, 
among other contingencies. 
Some of these customers have recently changed those goals to offer 70 cage-free eggs by 
 the end of 2030. While we 
anticipate that our retail and foodservice customers will 
continue to transition to selling cage-free eggs 
 given public 
commitments, 
there is 
no assurance 
that this 
transition 
will take 
place or 
take place 
according to 
the timeline 
of 
 current cage-free 
commitments. For 
example, customers 
may accelerate 
their transition 
to stocking 
cage-free eggs, 
which may 
 challenge our 
ability to 
meet the 
cage-free 
volume needs 
of those 
customers and 
result in 
a loss 
of shell 
egg 
sales. Similarly, 
 customers who 
commit to 
stock greater 
proportional quantities 
of cage-free 
eggs are 
under no 
obligation to 
continue to 
do so, 
 which may 
result in an 
oversupply of 
cage-free eggs and 
result in lower 
specialty egg 
prices, which could 
reduce the return 
on 
 our capital investment in cage-free production. 
 Changing our infrastructure and operating procedures to conform to consumer preferences, customer demands and 
new laws has 
 resulted and 
will continue 
to result 
in additional 
costs, including 
capital and 
operating cost 
increases. The 
USDA reported 
that 
 the estimated 
U.S. cage-free 
flock was 
121.6 million hens as 
of June 
30, 2023, 
which is approximately 
38.3 of 
the total U.S. 
 table 
egg 
layer 
hen 
population. 
According 
to 
the 
USDA 
Agricultural 
Marketing 
Service, 
as of 
May 
2023 
approximately 
221 
 million hens, 
or about 
70.5 of 
the U.S. 
non-organic 
laying flock 
would have 
to be 
in cage-free 
production by 
2026 to 
meet 
 projected demand 
from the 
retailers, foodservice 
providers and 
food 
manufacturers that 
have made 
goals to 
transition to 
cage-
 free eggs. 

 In response 
to our 
customers announced 
goals and 
increased legal 
requirements for 
cage-free eggs, 
we have 
increased capital 
 expenditures 
to 
increase 
our 
cage-free 
production 
capacity. 
We 
are 
also 
enhancing 
our 
focus 
on 
cage-free 
capacity 
when 
 considering 
acquisition opportunities. 
Our customers 
typically do 
not commit 
to long-term 
purchases of 
specific quantities 
or 
 type of eggs 
with us, and 
as a result, 
we cannot predict 
with any certainty 
which types of 
eggs they will 
require us to 
supply in 
 future 
periods. 
The 
production 
of 
cage-free 
eggs 
is 
more 
costly 
than 
the 
production 
of 
conventional 
eggs, 
and 
these 
higher 
 production costs contribute 
to the prices 
of cage-free eggs, 
which historically have 
typically been higher 
than conventional egg 
 prices. Many consumers prefer to buy less expensive conventional shell eggs. These consumer preferences may in turn influence 
 our customers future needs for 
cage-free and conventional eggs. 
Due to these uncertainties, 
we may over-estimate future demand 
 for cage-free 
eggs, which 
could increase 
our costs 
unnecessarily, 
or we 
may under-estimate 
future demand 
for cage-free 
eggs, 
 which could 
harm us 
competitively. 
If our 
competitors obtain 
non-cancelable 
long-term contracts 
to provide 
cage-free eggs 
to 
 our existing or potential customers, 
then there may be decreased demand 
for our cage-free eggs due 
to these lost potential sales. 
 If we and our 
competitors increase cage-free egg production 
and there is no 
commensurate increase in demand for 
cage-free eggs, 
 this overproduction 
could lead to 
an oversupply of 
cage-free eggs, reducing 
the sales price 
for specialty eggs 
and our return 
on 
 capital investments in cage-free production. 
 Failure 
to 
comply 
with 
applicable 
governmental 
regulations, 
including 
environmental 
regulations, 
could 
harm 
our 
 operating results, 
financial condition, 
and reputation. 
Further, 
we may 
incur significant 
costs to 
comply with 
any such 
 regulations. 
 We are subject to federal, state and local 
regulations relating to grading, quality 
control, labeling, sanitary control, waste 
disposal, 
 and other 
areas of 
our business. 
As a 
fully-integrated 
shell egg 
producer, 
our shell 
egg facilities 
are subject 
to regulation 
and 
 inspection by the USDA, OSHA, EPA 
and FDA, as well as state and local health and agricultural agencies, among others. All of 

18 
 our shell egg production and 
feed mill facilities are subject 
to FDA, EPA and OSHA regulation and inspections. In addition, rules 
 are often proposed 
that, if adopted as proposed, could increase our costs. 

 Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations 
 governing, 
among 
other 
things, 
the 
generation, 
storage, 
handling, 
use, 
transportation, 
disposal, 
and 
remediation 
of 
hazardous 
 materials. Under these laws and 
regulations, we are required to obtain permits 
from governmental authorities, including, but 
not 
 limited to wastewater discharge permits and manure 
and litter land applications. 
 If we 
fail to 
comply with 
applicable laws 
or regulations, 
or fail 
to obtain 
necessary permits, 
we could 
be subject 
to significant 
 fines and penalties or other sanctions, our reputation could be harmed, and our operating results and financial condition could be 
 materially 
adversely 
affected. 
In 
addition, 
because 
these 
laws and 
regulations 
are 
becoming 
increasingly 
more 
stringent, 
it is 
 possible that we will be required to incur significant costs for compliance 
with such laws and regulations in the future. 
 Climate change and legal or regulatory responses 
may have an adverse impact on our business and results of 
operations. 

 Extreme 
weather 
events, 
such 
as derechos, 
wildfires, 
drought, 
tornadoes, 
hurricanes, 
storms, 
floods 
or 
other 
natural 
disasters 
 could materially and adversely affect our operating 
results and financial condition. In fact, derechos, fires, floods, 
tornadoes and 
 hurricanes have affected our facilities or the facilities of other egg producers in the past. Increased global temperatures 
and more 
 frequent occurrences 
of extreme 
weather events, 
which may 
be exacerbated 
by climate 
change, may 
cause crop 
and livestock 
 areas to 
become unsuitable, 
including due 
to water 
scarcity or 
high or 
unpredictable 
temperatures, 
which may 
result in 
much 
 greater stress on food systems and more pronounced food 
insecurity globally. Lower 
global crop production, including corn and 
 soybean meal, 
which are 
the primary 
feed ingredients 
that support 
the health of 
our animals, 
may result 
in significantly 
higher 
 prices for these commodity inputs, impact our ability to source the commodities we use to feed our flocks, and negatively impact 
 our ability 
to maintain 
or grow our 
operations. Climate 
change may 
increasingly expose 
workers and 
animals to 
high heat 
and 
 humidity stressors that adversely impact poultry production. Increased 
greenhouse gas emissions may also negatively impact air 
 quality, soil quality 
and water quality, 
which may hamper our ability to support our operations, 
particularly in higher water- and 
 soil-stressed regions. 

 Increasing 
frequency of 
severe weather 
events, whether 
tied to 
climate change 
or any 
other cause, 
may negatively 
impact our 
 ability to raise 
poultry and 
produce eggs profitably 
or to 
operate our transportation 
and logistics 
supply chains. Regulatory 
controls 
 and 
market 
pricing may 
continue 
to drive 
the costs 
of fossil 
-based 
fuels higher, 
which 
could negatively 
impact 
our ability 
to 
 source commodities 
necessary to 
operate our 
farms or 
plants and 
our current 
fleet of 
vehicles. These 
changes may 
cause us 
to 
 change, significantly, our day-to-day 
business operations and our strategy. Climate change and extreme weather events may also 
 impact demand for our products 
given evolution of consumer food preferences. 
Even if we take 
measures to position our business 
 in anticipation 
of such 
changes, future 
compliance 
with legal 
or regulatory 
requirements may 
require significant 
management 
 time, oversight and enterprise expense. We 
may also incur significant expense tied to regulatory fines if laws and regulations are 
 interpreted and applied 
in a manner that 
is inconsistent with our 
business practices. We 
can make no 
assurances that our efforts 
 to prepare 
for these 
adverse events 
will be 
in line 
with future 
market and 
regulatory expectations 
and our 
access to 
capital to 
 support our business may also be adversely impacted. 
 Current and future litigation could expose us to significant 
liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation. 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. 
Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although 
 we 
believe 
we 
have 
meaningful 
defenses 
in 
these 
matters, 
we 
may 
incur 
liabilities 
due 
to 
adverse 
judgments 
or 
enter 
into 
 settlements of claims that 
could have a material 
adverse effect on our 
results of operations, cash 
flow and financial condition. 
For 
 a 
discussion 
of 
our 
ongoing 
legal 
proceedings 
see 
 Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
below 
and 
Part 
II. 
Item 
8. 
Notes 
to 
the 
 Consolidated Financial 
Statements, 
 Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies 
 . 
 
Such lawsuits are 
expensive to 
defend, divert 
 management s 
attention, and 
may 
result in 
significant 
adverse judgments 
or settlements. Legal 
proceedings 
may expose 
us to 
 negative publicity, 
which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference 
for our products and brands. 
 FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISK FACTORS 
 Weak 
or unstable 
economic 
conditions, including 
continued 
higher inflation 
and rising 
interest 
rates, 
could negatively 
 impact our business. 
 Weak 
or unstable 
economic conditions, 
including continued 
higher inflation 
and rising 
interest rates, 
may adversely 
affect our 
 business by: 
 
 Limiting our access to capital markets or increasing the cost of capital we may 
need to grow our business; 

Changing consumer spending and habits and demand for eggs, particularly 
higher-priced eggs; 

19 
 
 Restricting the supply of energy sources or increasing our cost to procure 
energy; or 
 
 Reducing the availability of feed 
ingredients, packaging material, and other raw 
materials, or increasing the cost 
of these 
 items. 
 Deterioration of economic conditions could also negatively 
impact: 
 
 The financial condition of our suppliers, which may make it more 
difficult for them to supply raw materials; 
 
 The financial condition of our customers, which may decrease demand for 
eggs or increase our bad debt expense; or 
 
 The financial condition of our insurers, which could increase our cost to obtain insurance, and/or make it difficult for or 
 insurers to meet their obligations in the event we experience a loss due to an 
insured peril. 
 According 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Bureau 
of 
Labor 
Statistics, 
from 
May 
2021 
to 
May 
2022, 
the 
Consumer 
Price Index for 
All 
Urban 
 Consumers CPI-U increased 
8.5 percent, the largest 
12-month increase since 
the period ending December 
1981. The CPI-U 
 increased 4.1 from May 2022 to May 2023. Inflationary costs have increased our input costs, and if 
we are unable to pass these 
 costs through to the customer it could have an adverse effect on 
our business. 
 We 
hold 
significant 
cash balances 
in deposit 
accounts with 
deposits in 
excess of 
the amounts 
insured by 
the Federal 
Deposit 
 Insurance Corporation FDIC ). In 
the event of 
a bank failure 
at an institution 
where we maintain 
deposits in excess 
of the FDIC-
 insured amount, we may lose such excess deposits. 
 The 
loss 
of 
any 
registered 
trademark 
or 
other 
intellectual 
property 
could 
enable 
other 
companies 
to 
compete 
more 
 effectively with us. 
 We 
utilize intellectual 
property in 
our business. For 
example, we 
own the 
trademarks 
 Farmhouse Eggs 
 , 
 4Grain , Sunups 
 , 
 and 
 Sunny Meadow 
 . We 
produce and market 
 Egg-Land s 
Best 
 
and 
 Land O Lakes
 under license 
agreements with EB. We 
 have invested a significant amount of 
money in establishing and promoting 
our trademarked brands. The loss or 
expiration of any 
 intellectual property could 
enable our competitors 
to compete more 
effectively with us 
by allowing them 
to make and 
sell products 
 substantially 
similar 
to 
those 
we 
offer. 
This 
could 
negatively 
impact 
our 
ability 
to 
produce 
and 
sell 
those 
products, 
thereby 
 adversely affecting our operations. 
 Impairment in the carrying value 
of goodwill or other assets 
could negatively affect our results of 
operations or net worth. 
 Goodwill 
represents 
the 
excess 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
business 
acquisitions 
over 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
the 
identifiable 
net 
assets 
 acquired. Goodwill 
is 
reviewed 
at 
least 
annually 
for 
impairment 
by 
assessing 
qualitative 
factors 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
 existence of events or circumstances 
leads to a determination that 
it is more likely than not 
that the fair value of 
a reporting unit 
 is less 
than its 
carrying 
amount. As of 
June 3, 
2023, we 
had 44.0 million 
of goodwill. While 
we believe 
the current 
carrying 
 value of this goodwill is not impaired, future goodwill impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in any 
 particular period and our net worth. 
 Events beyond our control such as extreme 
weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business. 

 Fire, 
bioterrorism, 
pandemics, 
extreme 
weather 
or natural 
disasters, including 
droughts, 
floods, 
excessive 
cold 
or 
heat, water 
 rights restrictions, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, decrease production or availability 
 of feed ingredients, or interfere 
with our operations due to 
power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from 
overtopped or breached 
 wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production and processing facilities, labor shortages or disruption of transportation 
 channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse 
effect on our financial results.

 Dividends 

 Cal-Maine has a 
variable dividend policy 
adopted by its 
Board of Directors. 
Pursuant to the 
policy, 
Cal-Maine pays 
a dividend 
 to shareholders of 
its Common Stock and 
Class A Common 
Stock on a quarterly 
basis for each quarter 
for which the Company 
 reports net 
income attributable 
to Cal-Maine 
Foods, Inc. 
computed in 
accordance with 
GAAP in 
an amount 
equal to 
one-third 

21 
 (1/3) of 
such quarterly 
income. Dividends 
are paid 
to shareholders 
of record 
as of 
the 60th 
day following 
the last 
day of 
such 
 quarter, except for 
the fourth fiscal quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, 
the Company will pay dividends 
to shareholders of record on 
 the 65th day after the 
quarter end. Dividends are payable 
on the 15th day following 
the record date. Following a 
quarter for which 
 the 
Company 
does 
not 
report 
net 
income 
attributable 
to 
Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc., 
the 
Company 
will 
not 
pay 
a 
dividend 
for 
a 
 subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a 
cumulative basis computed from the date of the 
last quarter for 
 which 
a 
dividend 
was 
paid. Under 
the 
Company's 
Credit 
Facility, 
dividends 
are 
restricted 
to 
the 
amount 
permitted 
under 
the 
 Company s 
current dividend policy, 
and may not 
be paid if 
a default exists 
or will arise 
after giving effect 
to the dividend 
or if 
 the sum of 
cash and cash 
equivalents of 
the Company and 
its subsidiaries plus 
availability under 
the Credit Facility 
equals less 
 than 50 million.

 COMPANY 
OVERVIEW 
 Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of 
fresh shell eggs. 
 Our 
fiscal 
year 
end 
is 
the 
Saturday 
closest 
to 
May 31. 
The 
fiscal 
year 
2023 
and 
2022 
included 
53 
weeks 
and 
52 
weeks, 
 respectively. 
The Company, 
which 
is headquartered 
in Ridgeland, 
Mississippi, is 
the largest 
producer and 
distributor 
of fresh 
 shell eggs in the United States U.S ). In fiscal 2023, we sold approximately 1,147.4 million dozen shell 
eggs, which we believe 
 represented 
approximately 
21 of 
domestic shell 
egg consumptio 
n. Our 
total flock 
as of 
June 3, 
2023 
of approximately 
41.2 
 million layers and 10.8 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the 
U.S. We sell most of 
our shell eggs to a diverse group of 
 customers, including 
national and 
regional grocery 
store chains, 
club stores, 
companies servicing 
independent supermarkets 
in 
 the U.S., food 
service distributors, and 
egg product consumers 
in states across 
the southwestern, southeastern, 
mid-western and 
 mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. 
 The Company has one reportable 
operating segment, which is the production, 
grading, packaging, marketing and distribution 
of 
 shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. 
 Specialty 
eggs 
represent 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
products. We 
classify 
cage-free, 
organic, 
brown, 
free-range, 
pasture-raised 
and 
 nutritionally enhanced 
as specialty eggs for 
accounting and reporting 
purposes. We 
classify all other 
shell eggs as conventional 
 eggs. 
While 
we 
report 
separate 
sales 
information 
for 
these 
types 
of 
eggs, 
there 
are 
a 
number 
of 
cost 
factors 
which 
are 
not 
 specifically 
available 
for 
conventional 
or 
specialty 
eggs due 
to 
the 
nature 
of egg 
production. 
We 
manage 
our 
operations 
and 
 allocate resources to these 
types of eggs on a consolidated 
basis based on the demands 
of our customers. For further 
description 
 of our business, refer to 
 Part I. Item I. Business 
 . 
 HPAI 
 Since the first detection in 
a U.S. commercial flock in 
February 2022, outbreaks of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza HPAI 
 continued 
to occur 
in U.S. 
poultry flocks 
throughout calendar 
year 2022 
and, less 
frequently, 
in calendar 
year 2023, 
which is 
 more than twice the length of time 
of the last HPAI outbreak in 2014-2015. HPAI affected more than 58 million birds in 47 states 
 and 
resulted 
in 
the 
depopulation 
of 
43.3 
million 
commercial 
layer 
hens 
and 
1.0 
million 
pullets 
leading 
to 
higher 
prices 
for 
 conventional 
shell eggs 
beginning in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
fiscal 2022 
and continuing 
through the 
third quarter 
of fiscal 
2023. 
 Though the virus is still present, due to seasonal migratory patterns of wild birds (which serve as carriers for the disease) the rate 
 of outbreaks has substantially 
decreased and the last 
occurrence in a commercial 
egg laying flock was in 
December 2022. 
The 
 USDA 
attributes 
this, 
in 
large 
part, 
to 
improved 
biosecurity 
measures 
by 
the 
commercial 
poultry 
industry. 
The 
industry 
and 
 USDA have devoted 
significant resources to 
attempt to prevent 
future outbreaks. With 
the spring wild 
bird migration complete 
 in the U.S., focus is on the fall migration season. 
 We 
believe the 
HPAI 
outbreak will 
continue to 
impact the overall 
supply of 
eggs until the 
layer hen 
flock is 
fully replenished. 
 The egg industry typically experiences lower sales during the 
summer. The layer hen flock five-year average from 2020-2022 for 
 the month of June is 321.5 million hens. According to the USDA the U.S. 
flock consisted of 317.4 million layers producing table 
 or 
market 
type 
eggs as 
of 
July 
1, 
2023, 
which 
is 0.9 
below 
the 
five-year 
average 
and 
reflects 
efforts 
by 
U.S. 
producers 
to 
 repopulate their flocks. As the layer flock began to recover in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, prices for conventional shell eggs 
 decreased 
from 
previous 
highs. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
positive 
tests 
for 
HPAI 
at 
any 
Cal-Maine 
Foods 
owned 
or 
contracted 
 production facility as of July 
25, 2023. While no farm 
is immune from HPAI, 
we believe we have implemented 
and continue to 
 maintain robust biosecurity programs across our locations. We 
are also working closely with federal, state and local government 
 officials 
and focused 
industry groups 
to mitigate 
the risk 
of this 
and future 
outbreaks and 
effectively 
manage our 
response, if 
 needed.

 (a) The net average 
shell egg selling price 
is the blended price 
for all sizes and 
grades of shell eggs, 
including non-graded 
 shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. 
 For fiscal 
2022, net 
sales increased 
to 1.8 
billion, gross 
profit to 
 337.1 million 
and net income 
to 132.7 
million from 
fiscal 
 2021 net sales of 
 1.3 billion, gross profit 
of 160.7 million and 
net income of 2.1 
million. The increases resulted primarily 
from 
 higher selling prices for 
conventional eggs as well as an 
increased volume of specialty 
eggs sold, partially offset 
by a decline in 
 the 
volume 
of 
conventional 
eggs 
sold. 
Gross 
profit 
and 
net 
income 
increases 
were 
partially 
offset 
by 
increased 
cost 
of 
feed 
 ingredients and increased processing 
costs. Consumer demand maintained 
a steady growth throughout our 
first three quarters of 
 fiscal 
2021 
but 
began 
trending 
down 
during 
our 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2021 
as 
consumers 
started 
to 
resume 
pre-pandemic 
 activities. 
We 
believe 
the 
decreased 
demand 
in 
foodservice 
seen 
throughout 
the 
first 
three 
quarters 
of 
fiscal 
2021 
due 
to 
the 
 pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell 
eggs for fiscal 2021 in the retail market due to the extra 
supply entering the 
 retail channel from the foodservice channel. 

 For 
fiscal 
2022, 
we 
believe 
prices 
for 
conventional 
eggs 
were 
positively 
impacted 
by 
a 
better 
alignment 
of 
the 
size 
of 
the 
 conventional 
production 
layer 
hen 
flock 
and 
customer 
and 
consumer 
demand 
through 
the 
first 
three 
fiscal 
quarters 
of 
2022. 
 Conventional egg 
prices further 
increased in 
the fourth 
quarter of 
fiscal 2022 
primarily due 
to decreased 
supply caused 
by the 
 HPAI 
outbreak 
compounded 
with 
good 
customer 
demand. 
Throughout 
fiscal 
2022 
the 
hen 
numbers 
reported 
by 
the 
USDA 
 remained below the five-year average. 

 For fiscal 
2023, net 
sales increased 
to 3.1 
billion, gross 
profit to 
 1.2 billion 
and net 
income to 
 758.0 million. 
The increases 
 primarily resulted 
from significantly 
higher average 
egg selling 
prices, primarily 
due to 
the reduction 
in egg 
supply caused 
by 
 HPAI 
and 
higher 
grain 
and 
other 
input 
costs, 
as 
some 
of 
our 
egg 
sales 
prices 
are 
based 
on 
formulas 
related 
to 
our 
costs 
of 
 production. Gross 
profit and 
net income 
increases were 
partially offset 
by the 
increased cost 
of feed 
ingredients and 
increased 
 processing, packaging 
and warehouse costs. 
The impact of 
HPAI 
continued throughout 
the first three 
quarters of fiscal 
2023 as 
 prices continued to increase. For the 
first three quarters of fiscal 
2023, the average UB southeastern large index 
price was 138.8 
 higher 
than 
the 
average 
price 
of 
the 
first 
three 
quarters 
in 
fiscal 
2022. 
For 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2023 
the 
average 
UB 
 southeastern large index price decreased 13.8 to 2.163 
from the same period in the 
prior year as the egg supply 
improved from 
 the effects 
of HPAI. 
Conventional egg 
selling prices 
declined significantly 
during the 
latter part 
of the 
fourth quarter 
of fiscal 
 2023. 
 Our dozens sold 
increased by 5.9 
for fiscal 2023 
compared to fiscal 
2022, primarily due 
to an increase 
in specialty egg 
sales. 
 According to 
Information Resources, 
Inc. IRI ), 
for the 
52 weeks 
ended June 
4, 2023, 
which approximately 
aligns with 
our 
 fiscal year 2023, conventional egg dozens sold in the U.S. at multi-retail outlets decreased 9.3 , while specialty egg dozens sold 
 increased 9.9 
versus the 
prior-year comparable 
period. Our 
conventional eggs 
dozens sold 
increased 0.2 
and specialty 
egg 
 dozens sold increased 18.6 as compared to fiscal 2022, with most of the increase 
due to an increase in cage-free eggs sold. 
 Our feed costs 
per dozen produced 
increased to 0.676 
in fiscal 2023, 
compared to 0.571 
in fiscal 2022. 
For fiscal year 
2023, 
 the average Chicago 
Board of Trade CBOT daily market 
price was 6.57 
per bushel for 
corn and 450 
per ton for 
soybean 
 meal, 
representing 
increases 
of 
4.1 
and 
14.7 , 
respectively, 
compared 
to 
the 
daily 
average 
CBOT 
prices 
for 
fiscal 
2022. 
 Supplies 
of corn and soybean meal remained tight 
relative to demand in throughout fiscal 2023, 
as evidenced by a low stock-to-
 use ratio 
for corn, 
as a 
result of 
weather-related 
shortfalls in 
production 
and yields, 
ongoing supply 
chain disruptions 
and 
the 
 Russia-Ukraine War 
and its 
impact on 
the export 
markets. Basis 
levels for 
corn and 
soybean meal, 
which impact 
our costs for 

25 
 these feed ingredients, ran significantly higher in fiscal 2023 in our areas of operation compared to our prior year fiscal year as a 
 result of higher transportation and storage costs, adding to our expense.

 Shell egg net sales 
 -
 For 
fiscal 
2023, 
shell 
egg 
net 
sales 
increased 
 1.3 
billion, 
primarily 
due 
to 
higher 
net 
average 
selling 
prices 
for 
 conventional eggs, and to a lesser extent specialty eggs. 
 -
 For fiscal 202 
3, conventional 
egg sales increased 
 990.0 million, 
or 93.2 , compared 
to fiscal 2022, 
primarily due 
to 
 the increase in 
conventional egg 
prices. Changes 
in price resulted 
in a 988.0 
million increase and 
changes 
in volume 
 resulted in a 1.7 million increase in net sales. 
 -
 Conventional egg prices increased in the first three quarters 
of fiscal 2023 primarily due to decreased supply 
caused by 
 the HPAI outbreak, discussed above. Conventional egg prices decreased 
substantially in the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 2023 
 compared to average 
fiscal 2023 levels, due 
to an increased supply 
of conventional eggs 
caused by the repopulating 
of 
 layer 
flocks 
in 
response 
to 
the 
impact 
of 
HPAI 
and 
typical 
seasonal 
decreases 
in 
demand. 
Conventional 
egg 
prices 
 exceeded 
specialty 
egg 
prices 
during 
fiscal 
2022 
and 
for 
the 
first 
three 
quarters 
of 
fiscal 
2023, 
which 
is 
atypical 
 historically. Conventional 
egg prices generally respond more quickly to market conditions because we sell the majority 
 of 
our 
conventional 
shell 
eggs 
based 
on 
formulas 
that 
adjust 
periodically 
and 
take 
into 
account, 
in 
varying 
ways, 
 independently quoted regional wholesale market prices for shell 
eggs or formulas related to our 
costs of production. The 
 majority of our specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated 
directly with customers and therefore do 
 not fluctuate as much as conventional pricing. 
 -
 Specialty egg sales 
increased 308.2 million, or 
47.5 , for fiscal 
2023 
compared to fiscal 
2022, primarily due 
to a 24.4 
 increase in specialty egg 
prices and a 18.6 increase 
in the volume of 
specialty dozens sold. Changes 
in price resulted 
 in a 187.6 
million increase and 
change in volume 
resulted in a 
 120.6 million increase 
in net sales, 
respectively. 
Our 

27 
 specialty egg sales also benefitted from our additional 
cage-free production capacity. 
Cage-free revenue for fiscal 2023 
 was 20.2 of total revenue, compared to 22.3 for fiscal 2022. 
 -
 Net average selling 
prices of specialty eggs 
increased by agreements with 
our customers in response 
to rising feed and 
 other input costs as well as lower supply availability due to HPAI. 
 -
 Demand for specialty 
eggs increased during 
the first three 
quarters of fiscal 
2023 as conventional 
egg prices rose. 
Our 
 sales volume benefited versus the prior-year period, through use of 
our higher cage-free production capacity. 
 Egg products net sales 
 -
 Egg products net sales increased 62.3 million or 103.8 , primarily due to an 86.1 selling price increase compared to 
 fiscal 2022, which had a 56.6 million positive impact on net sales. 
 -
 Our egg products net average selling 
price increased in fiscal 2023, compared 
to fiscal 2022 as the supply of shell 
eggs 
 used to produce egg products decreased due to the HPAI 
outbreak that started in February 2022. 
 COST OF SALES 
 Cost of sales for fiscal 2023 
were 1.9 billion compared to 1.4 billion for fiscal 2022. 
 Cost of 
sales consists 
of 
costs directly 
related 
to producing, 
processing 
and 
packing 
shell eggs, 
purchases 
of 
shell 
eggs from 
 outside sources, 
processing and 
packing of 
liquid and 
frozen egg 
products and 
other non-egg 
costs. Farm production 
costs are 
 those 
costs incurred 
at the 
egg production 
facility, 
including feed, 
facility, 
hen amortization 
and other 
related farm 
production 
 costs.

 Farm Production 
 -
 Feed costs 
per dozen 
produced increased 
18.4 in 
fiscal 2023 
compared to 
fiscal 2022, 
primarily due 
to higher 
feed 
 ingredient prices. Basis levels for corn and soybean meal 
ran significantly higher in our areas of operation 
compared to 
 our prior fiscal year due to higher transportation and storage costs, adding 
to our expense. 
 -
 For fiscal 2023, the average daily CBOT market price was 6.57 per bushel for corn and 450 per ton of soybean meal, 
 representing increases of 4.1 and 14.7 , respectively, 
as compared to the average daily CBOT prices for fiscal 2022. 

28 
 -
 Other farm production 
costs increased due 
to higher 
facility and 
flock amortization. 
Facility costs 
increased due primarily 
 to increased labor costs. Labor costs increased 29.6 
due to increased use of contract labor and increased wages 
raised 
 in response to labor shortages. 
 -
 Flock amortization increased 
primarily from higher 
capitalized feed costs 
as well as higher 
amortization costs from 
an 
 increase in our cage-free production. 
 Supplies of corn and soybean remained tight relative to demand throughout fiscal 2023, as evidenced by a low stock-to-use 
ratio 
 for 
corn, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
weather-related 
shortfalls 
in 
production 
and 
yields, 
ongoing 
supply 
chain 
disruptions 
and 
the 
Russia-
 Ukraine 
War 
and 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
export 
markets. 
For 
fiscal 
2024, 
we 
expect 
continued 
corn 
and 
soybean 
upward 
pricing 
 pressures and further market volatility to affect feed costs. 
 Processing, packaging, and warehouse 
 -
 Cost of packaging materials increased 18.6 compared to 
fiscal 2022 
as costs increased due to rising 
inflation and labor 
 costs. 
 -
 Labor costs increased 13.6 due to wage increases instituted in response 
to labor shortages and rising inflation. 
 -
 Dozens processed increased 3.6 compared to fiscal 2022, which 
resulted in an 11.2 million increase in costs. 
 Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) 
 -
 Costs in this category increased 
120.8 compared to fiscal 2022 
primarily due to the 
increase in egg prices. The 
average 
 price 
of outside 
egg 
purchases 
increased 
75.6 
per 
dozen compared 
to 
fiscal 
2022. 
Additionally, 
our 
percentage 
of 
 produced to 
sold decreased 
to 92.3 
in fiscal 
2023 from 
94.3 in 
fiscal 2022 
as we 
increased our 
volume of 
outside 
 egg purchases in order to meet customer demand. 
 GROSS PROFIT 
 Gross profit, 
as a percentage 
of net sales, 
was 38.0 
for fiscal 2023 
, 
compared to 19.0 
for fiscal 2022. 
The increase resulted 
 primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume 
of specialty eggs sold, partially offset 
 by the increased cost of feed ingredients and processing, packaging 
and warehouse costs. 
 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
EXPENSES 
 Selling, 
general, 
and 
administrative SGA 
expenses 
include 
costs 
of 
marketing, 
distribution, 
accounting, 
and 
corporate 
 overhead. SG A expenses increased 
 33.6 million to 232.2 
million in fiscal 2023.

 Specialty egg expense 
 -
 Specialty egg 
expense, which 
includes franchise 
fees, advertising 
and promotion 
costs generally 
tracks with 
specialty 
 egg 
volumes, 
which 
were 
up 
18.6 
for 
fiscal 
2023 
compared 
to 
fiscal 
2022. 
However, 
our 
specialty 
egg 
expense 
 decreased 3.5 , 
primarily due 
to a 
significant reduction 
in advertising 
costs. The 
higher prices 
for conventional 
eggs 
 and 
the 
comparatively 
lower prices 
for 
specialty eggs 
diminished 
the need 
to promote 
specialty eggs 
in fiscal 
2023. 
 However, we anticipate that the need to promote specialty eggs will increase 
in fiscal 2024 as the market recovers from 
 the effects of HPAI. 

29 
 Delivery expense 
 -
 The increased 
delivery expense 
is primarily 
due to 
the increase 
in fuel 
and labor 
costs for 
both our 
fleet and 
contract 
 trucking. Compared to fiscal 
2022, contract trucking and 
labor expenses increased 
approximately 10.2 million for 
fiscal 
 2023. 
 Payroll, taxes and benefits expense 
 -
 The 
increase 
in 
payroll, 
taxes 
and 
benefits 
expense 
is 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
accrual 
for 
anticipated 
 performance-based bonuses. 
 Other expenses 
 -
 The increase in other 
expenses is due to 
increased legal expenses of 
approximately 3.6 million 
as well as inflationary 
 pressure increasing costs. 
 OPERATING 
INCOME (LOSS) 
 As a result of the above, our operating income was 967.7 million for fiscal 2023 
, 
compared to 143.5 million for fiscal 2022. 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 
 Total 
other 
income 
(expense) 
consists 
of 
items 
not 
directly 
charged 
to, 
or 
related 
to, 
operations 
such 
as 
interest 
income 
and 
 expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, 
among other items. 

 The Company recorded interest income of 18.6 million in fiscal 2023, 
compared to 988 thousand in fiscal 2022, primarily due 
 to significantly 
higher cash 
and cash 
equivalents and 
investment securities 
available-for-sale balances 
and yields. 
We 
recorded 
 interest expense of 583 thousand and 403 thousand 
in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to commitment fees 
 on our Credit Facility described below. 
 Equity in income from unconsolidated entities for fiscal 2023 was 746 
thousand compared to 1.9 million for fiscal 2022. 
 Other, net 
for fiscal 2023 
was income of 
 1.9 million compared 
to 9.8 million for 
fiscal 2022. 
The majority of 
the decrease is 
 due 
to 
our 
acquisition 
in 
fiscal 
2022 
of 
the 
remaining 
50 membership 
interest 
in 
Red 
River 
Valley 
Egg 
Farm, 
LLC Red 
 River as we recognized a 4.5 million gain in fiscal 2022 due to the remeasurement of our equity investment. 
We also received 
 1.4 million in fiscal 2022 related 
to our review and adjustment 
of our various marketing agreements. Additionally, the Company 
 recorded a 2 million impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated entity 
in fiscal 2023. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 For 
the 
fiscal 
year 
ended 
June 
3, 
2023, 
our 
pre-tax 
income 
was 
 998.6 
million, 
compared 
to 
 166.0 
million 
for 
fiscal 
2022. 
 Income tax expense of 241.8 million 
was recorded for fiscal 2023 with an effective 
tax rate of 24.2 . 
For fiscal 2022, income 
 tax expense was 33.6 million with an effective tax rate 
of 20.2 . Included in fiscal 2022 income tax expense is the discrete tax 
 benefit of 
 8.3 million 
discussed in 
 Note 2 Acquisition 
 
of Part 
II. Item 
8. Notes 
to Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
in this 
 Annual Report. 
Excluding the discrete 
tax benefit, 
income tax expense 
was 41.9 
million with an 
adjusted effective 
tax rate of 
 25.2 . 

 At June 3, 2023, the Company had 
an income tax receivable of 67.0 million compared to 
 42.1 million at May 28, 2022. During 
 fiscal 2022, 
the Company 
filed federal 
carryback tax 
returns for 
fiscal 2020 
and 2021 
taxable net 
operating losses 
to recover 
a 
 portion of 
taxes paid 
in fiscal 2015 
and fiscal 
2016. Subsequent 
to fiscal 
2023, we 
received 31.8 
million of 
the 34.9 
million 
 fiscal 2021 refund and believe we will receive the remaining amount of the fiscal 2020 and 2021 refunds, totaling 
 11.7 million, 
 during our second fiscal quarter of 2024. 
An additional 23.5 million income tax receivable was recorded as of June 3, 2023 for 
 fiscal 2023 federal overpayments in excess of federal tax liability. 
 Items causing 
our effective 
tax rate 
to differ 
from the 
federal statutory 
income tax 
rate of 
21 are 
state income 
taxes, certain 
 federal tax 
credits and 
certain items included 
in income or 
loss for financial 
reporting purposes that 
are not included 
in taxable 
 income or 
loss for income 
tax purposes, including 
tax exempt interest 
income, certain 
nondeductible expenses, 
and net income 
 or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. 

30 
 NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE 
TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 
 Net loss attributable 
to noncontrolling 
interest was 1.3 
million for fiscal 
2023 
compared to a 
 209 thousand 
net loss for 
fiscal 
 2022. 
 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE 
TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. 
 As a result of the above, net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for fiscal 
2023 was 758.0 million, or 15.58 per basic 
 and 15.52 per diluted share, compared to 132.7 million, or 2.73 per basic 
and 2.72 per diluted share for fiscal 2022. 
 Fiscal Year 
Ended May 28, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 
Ended May 29, 2021 
 The discussion 
of our 
results of 
operations for 
the fiscal 
year ended 
May 28, 
2022 compared 
to the 
fiscal year 
ended May 
29, 
 2021 can be found in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
of Operations in 
 the Company s fiscal 2022 
Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL 
RESOURCES 
 Working 
Capital and Current Ratio 
 Our working capital at 
June 3, 2023 was 
 942.2 million, compared to 476.8 million at 
May 28, 2022. 
The calculation of working 
 capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 6.16 at June 3, 2023 compared to 3.58 at May 28, 
 2022. 
The current 
ratio is 
calculated 
by dividing 
current assets 
by current 
liabilities. The 
increase 
in our 
working 
capital and 
 current ratio 
is primarily due 
to the increase 
in total current 
assets, which increased 
by 463.4 million 
to 1.1 billion 
at June 3, 
 2023, 
due 
to significant 
increases in 
cash and 
cash equivalents 
and 
investment 
securities available 
-for-sale. 
Due to 
seasonal 
 factors described in 
 Part I. Item I. Business Seasonality 
 , we generally expect 
our need for working 
capital to be highest in 
the 
 fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, 
respectively. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided 
by operating activities 
was 863.0 
million for fiscal 
year 2023 
compared with 126.2 
million for fiscal 
year 
 2022. 
The increase in cash flow from operations 
resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs 
as well as the 
 increased volume of specialty eggs 
sold, partially offset by the increased 
cost of feed ingredients and processing, 
packaging and 
 warehouse costs. 

 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 We 
continue 
to 
invest 
in 
our 
facilities, 
with 
 136.6 
million 
used 
to 
purchase 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment 
for 
fiscal 
2023, 
 compared to 72.4 
million in fiscal 2022. 
These investments were primarily 
made to expand our 
cage-free production capacity. 
 We 
have for many years 
invested substantial amounts 
to expand our cage-free 
production capacity and 
expect to continue to 
do 
 so. 
Purchases 
of 
investments 
were 
 530.8 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2023, 
compared 
to 
 98.2 
million 
in 
fiscal 
2022. 
The 
increase 
in 
 purchases of 
investment securities 
is primarily 
due to 
the utilization 
of increased 
liquidity resulting 
from increased 
cash flows 
 provided by operating 
activities noted above. 
Sales and maturities 
of investment securities 
were 291.8 
million for fiscal 
2023, 
 compared to 92.7 million 
for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 
2022, we also acquired the 
remaining 50 membership interest 
in Red 
 River for 44.8 million, net of cash acquired. 

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 We paid dividends 
totaling 252.3 million and 6.1 million in fiscal 2023 
and 2022, respectively. 

 As of 
June 3, 
2023, cash 
increased 
 233.7 million 
since May 
28, 2022, 
compared to 
an increase 
of 1.7 
million during 
fiscal 
 2022. 
 Credit Facility 
 We had no 
long-term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2023 
and 2022. On November 15, 2021, we entered 
into an Amended 
 and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended the Credit 
Agreement with a five-year term. The Credit Agreement provides for 
 a senior 
secured revolving 
credit facility 
(the Credit 
Facility ), in 
an initial 
aggregate principal 
amount of 
up to 
 250 million. 
 As of June 3, 2023, no amounts were borrowed under 
the Credit Facility. We 
have 4.3 
million in outstanding standby letters of 
 credit, which were issued under our Credit Facility for the 
benefit of certain insurance companies. In May 2023, 
we entered into 

31 
 an amendment to 
the Credit Agreement 
to replace the 
London Interbank Offered 
Rate interest rate 
benchmark. Refer 
to Part II. 
 Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, 
 Note 10 Credit Facility 
 
for further information regarding our long-term debt.
 Material Cash Requirements 
 Material cash 
requirements for 
operating activities 
primarily consist 
of feed 
ingredients, processing, 
packaging and 
warehouse 
 costs, employee related 
costs, and other 
general operating expenses, 
which we expect 
to be paid 
from our cash 
from operations 
 and cash and 
investment securities on 
hand for at 
least the next 
12 months. While 
volatile egg prices 
and feed ingredient 
costs, 
 among 
other 
things, 
make 
long-term 
predictions 
difficult, 
we 
have 
substantial 
liquid 
assets 
and 
availability 
under 
our 
Credit 
 Facility to fund future operating requirements. 
 Our material cash requirements for capital expenditures consist primarily 
of our projects to increase our cage-free production 
 capacity. We 
continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage 
with our customers in efforts to help 
 them achieve their announced timelines for cage-free egg sales. The following 
table presents material construction projects

currently in place thereafter. 
 IMPACT OF 
RECENTLY 
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 For information on changes in accounting 
principles and new accounting principles, 
see 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
and 
 Policies
 in Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 . 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions 
 that affect the 
reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities 
at the date 
of the financial 
statements and the 
reported amounts of 
revenues 
 and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could 
differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are 
those 
 estimates made in 
accordance with GAAP 
that involve a 
significant level of estimation 
uncertainty and have had 
or are reasonably 
 likely to have a material impact 
on the financial condition or results 
of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described 
 below. 

32 
 BUSINESS COMBINATION 
S 
 The Company applies the acquisition 
method of accounting, which 
requires that once control is obtained, 
all the assets acquired 
 and liabilities assumed, 
including amounts 
attributable to noncontrolling 
interests, are recorded 
at their respective 
fair values at 
 the 
date 
of acquisition. 
The 
excess 
of 
the 
purchase 
price 
over 
fair 
values 
of 
identifiable 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
is 
recorded 
as 
 goodwill. 
 We 
typically 
use the 
income method 
approach for 
intangible assets 
acquired 
in a 
business combination. 
Significant 
judgment 
 exists in valuing certain 
intangible assets. and the 
most significant assumptions requiring 
judgment involve estimating the 
amount 
 and timing of 
future cash flows, 
growth rates, 
discount rates selected 
to measure 
the risks inherent 
in the future 
cash flows and 
 the asset s expected useful lives. 

 The 
fair 
values 
of 
identifiable 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
determined 
internally 
and 
requires 
estimates 
and 
the 
use 
of 
various 
 valuation techniques. When a 
market value is not 
readily available, our internal 
valuation methodology considers the 
remaining 
 estimated life 
of the 
assets acquired 
and significant 
judgment is 
required 
as management 
determines the 
fair market 
value for 
 those assets. 

 Due 
to 
inherent 
industry 
uncertainties 
including 
volatile 
egg 
prices 
and 
feed 
costs, 
unanticipated 
market 
changes, 
events, 
or 
 circumstances may occur that could affect the estimates and assumptions 
used, which could result in subsequent impairments. 

 INVENTORIES 

 Inventories of eggs, feed, 
supplies and flocks 
are valued principally 
at the lower 
of cost (first-in, 
first-out method) or 
net realizable 
 value. If 
market 
prices 
for 
eggs and 
feed 
grains 
move 
substantially 
lower, 
we 
record 
adjustments 
to 
write 
down 
the 
carrying 
 values of eggs 
and feed inventories 
to fair market 
value. The cost 
associated with flock inventories, 
consisting principally of chick 
 purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and 
overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22 
 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock s productive 
life, generally one to two years. Judgment exists in 
 determining 
the flock s 
productive life 
including 
factors such 
as laying 
rate and 
egg size, 
molt cycles, 
and customer 
demand. 
 Furthermore, other factors such as 
hen type or weather conditions could affect 
the productive life. These factors could 
make our 
 estimates of productive life differ from actual results. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from 
 disease or extreme temperatures will 
result in abnormal write-downs to 
flock inventories. Management continually monitors each 
 flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality 
loss. 
 GOODWILL 
 As 
a 
result 
of 
acquiring 
businesses, 
the 
Company 
has 
 44.0 
million 
of 
goodwill 
on 
June 
3, 
2023. 
Goodwill 
is 
evaluated 
for 
 impairment 
annually 
by 
first 
performing 
a 
qualitative 
assessment 
to 
determine 
whether 
a 
quantitative 
goodwill 
test 
is 
 necessary. After 
assessing the totality of events or 
circumstances, if we determine it 
is more likely than not that the 
fair value of 
 a reporting unit is less than its carrying 
amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to 
determine the magnitude of any 
 impairment. 
 The 
Company 
has 
determined 
that 
all 
of 
our 
locations 
share 
similar 
economic 
characteristics 
and 
support 
each 
other 
in 
the 
 production of eggs and customer support. Therefore, we aggregate all our locations as a single reporting unit for testing goodwill 
 for 
impairment. 
When 
the 
Company 
acquires 
a 
new 
location, 
we 
determine 
whether 
it 
should 
be 
integrated 
into 
our 
single 
 reporting unit or 
treated as a 
separate reporting unit. Historically, we 
have concluded that 
acquired operations should be 
integrated 
 into our single reporting unit due to the operational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant changes in management 
 that occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing 
similar economic characteristics with the 
 rest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes part of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it 
 no longer represents the particular 
acquired operations that gave rise to the 
goodwill. We 
may conclude that a business acquired 
 in the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately 
for goodwill impairment. 
 At June 3, 2023, goodwill represented 2.3 of total assets and 2.7 of stockholders 
equity. 

 Judgment exists in management s evaluation 
of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg 
 industry environment, cost inputs such as 
feed ingredients and overall financial performance. Furthermore, judgment 
exists in the 
 evaluation 
of the 
threshold of 
whether it 
is more 
likely than 
not that 
the fair 
value of 
a reporting 
unit is 
less than 
its carrying 
 amount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur 
that could negatively affect our operating conditions. 
 During the fourth quarter of 
2023, we elected to change the 
date of our annual impairment assessment 
from year-end to 
the first 
 day of the fourth quarter. 
The change was made to 
more closely align the impairment 
assessment date with our annual 
planning 

33 
 and forecasting 
process. The change 
in impairment 
assessment date 
did not 
have any 
impact on 
goodwill or 
the impairment 
of 
 goodwill. 
The change 
has been 
applied prospectively 
and will 
not have 
an impact 
on a 
retrospective basis. 
During our 
annual 
 impairment 
test 
in 
fiscal 
2023, 
we 
determined 
that 
goodwill 
passed 
the 
qualitative 
assessment 
and 
therefore 
no 
quantitative 
 analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary. 
 REVENUE RECOGNITION 
 Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within 
 days of the Company and customer 
agreeing upon the order. 
See 
 Note 13 Revenue Recognition 
 
in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the 
 Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy.
 The Company believes 
the performance obligation 
is met upon delivery 
and acceptance of 
the product by 
our customers. Costs 
 to deliver 
product to 
customers are 
included in selling, 
general and 
administrative expenses 
in the 
accompanying Consolidated 
 Statements 
of 
Income. Sales 
revenue 
reported 
in 
the 
accompanying 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Income 
is 
reduced 
to 
reflect 
 estimated returns 
and allowances. The 
Company records 
an estimated 
sales allowance 
for returns 
and discounts 
at the 
time of 
 sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. 
 The Company periodically provides 
incentive offers to its 
customers to encourage purchases. 
Such offers include current 
discount 
 offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), 
inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts 
subject to a minimum 
 current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the 
 sales price 
of the 
related transaction, 
while inducement 
offers, when 
accepted by 
customers, are 
treated as 
a reduction 
to sales 
 price based on estimated future redemption rates. 
Redemption rates are estimated using the Company s 
historical experience for 
 similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers 
are presented as a net amount in Net 
sales. 
 As the 
estimates noted 
above are 
based on 
historical information, 
we do 
not believe 
that there 
will be 
a material 
change in 
the 
 estimates and assumptions used 
to recognize revenue. However, 
if actual results varied significantly 
from our estimates it could 
 expose us to material gains or losses. 

 LOSS CONTINGENCIES 
 The Company evaluates 
whether a loss contingency 
exists, and if the 
assessment of a contingency 
indicates it is probable 
that a 
 material loss has 
been incurred and 
the amount of 
the loss can 
be reasonably estimated, 
the estimated loss 
would be accrued 
in 
 the Company s financial statements. 
The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. 
 There 
were 
no 
loss 
contingency 
reserves 
for 
the 
past 
three 
fiscal 
years. 
Our 
evaluation 
of 
whether 
loss 
contingencies 
exist 
 primarily relates to 
litigation matters. The 
outcome of litigation 
is uncertain due 
to, among other 
things, uncertainties regarding 
 the facts will be established 
during the proceedings, uncertainties 
regarding how the law will 
be applied to the facts 
established, 
 and uncertainties 
regarding the 
calculation of 
any potential 
damages or 
the costs 
of any 
potential injunctive 
relief. If 
the facts 
 discovered or the Company s 
assumptions change, future reserves for 
loss contingencies may be required. 
Results of operations 
 may be materially affected by losses or a loss contingency reserve 
resulting from adverse legal proceedings. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 We 
determine our 
effective tax 
rate by estimating 
our permanent differences 
resulting from differing 
treatment of items 
for tax 
 and accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty exist with management s application of tax regulations 
and evaluation of the 
 more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We 
are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax 
 settlement could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate 
and our results of operations. 

34 
 ITEM 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes 
in the prices of conventional eggs, 
which are subject to significant price 
 fluctuations that are largely 
beyond our control. We 
are focused on growing our 
specialty shell egg business because 
the selling 
 prices 
of 
specialty 
shell 
eggs are 
generally 
not 
as 
volatile 
as conventional 
shell 
egg 
prices. Our 
exposure 
to 
market 
risk 
also 
 includes changes in 
the prices of corn 
and soybean meal, 
which are commodities 
subject to significant 
price fluctuations due 
to 
 market conditions 
that are 
largely beyond 
our control. 
To 
ensure continued 
availability of 
feed ingredients, 
we may 
enter into 
 contracts for future 
purchases of corn 
and soybean meal, 
and as part of 
these contracts, we 
may lock-in 
the basis portion 
of our 
 grain purchases several months in 
advance and commit to purchase 
organic ingredients to help 
assure supply. 
Ordinarily, we 
do 
 not enter 
long-term contracts 
beyond a 
year to 
purchase corn 
and soybean 
meal or 
hedge against 
increases in 
the price 
of corn 
 and soybean meal. 
The following table

 INTEREST RATE 
RISK 
 We 
have 
a 
 250 million 
Credit 
Facility, 
borrowings 
under 
which 
would 
bear 
interest 
at 
variable 
rates. 
No 
amounts 
were 
 outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative 
 instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. 
 FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK 
 At June 3, 
2023, 
the effective maturity 
of our cash equivalents 
and investment securities 
available for sale 
was 4.8 months, and 
 the composite credit rating of 
the holdings are AA- / 
Aa3 / AA- (S P 
/ Moody s / Fitch). Generally speaking, rising 
interest rates, 
 as have 
been 
experienced 
in recent 
periods, 
decrease 
the value 
of fixed 
income 
securities 
portfolios. 
As of 
June 3, 
2023, 
the 
 estimated fair value 
of our 
fixed income securities 
portfolio was approximately 
 355 million 
and reflected 
unrealized losses 
of 
 approximately 
 2.4 
million.

 CONCENTRATION 
OF CREDIT RISK 
 Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit 
 risk with 
respect to 
receivables are 
limited due 
to our 
large number 
of customers 
and their 
dispersion across 
geographic areas, 
 except that 
at June 3, 
2023 and 
May 28, 
2022, 30.1 
and 27.9 , 
respectively, 
of our net 
accounts receivable 
balance was due 
 from 
Walmart 
Inc. 
(including 
Sam s 
Club). 
No 
other 
single 
customer 
or 
customer 
group 
represented 
10 
or 
greater 
of 
net 
 accounts receivable at June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022.

 Ridgeland, Mississippi 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 3, 
 2023 and 
May 28, 2022, 
the related consolidated 
statements of 
income, comprehensive

In 
our

in 
all 
material 
respects, 
the 
financial

opinion. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
entities 
management. 
Our 
responsibility 
is 
to 
 express an 
opinion on 
these consolidated 
financial statements 
based on 
our audits. 
We 
are a 
public accounting 
firm registered 
 with the PCAOB and 
are required to be 
independent with respect to 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 
and Subsidiaries in accordance 
with 
 the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws and 
the 
applicable 
rules 
and 
regulations 
of the 
Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission 
and 
the 
 PCAOB. 
 We 
conducted 
our audits 
in accordance 
with the 
standards of 
the PCAOB. 
Those 
standards require 
that we 
plan and 
 perform 
the 
audit 
to 
obtain 
reasonable 
assurance 
about 
whether 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
free 
of 
material 
 misstatement, 
whether 
due 
to 
error 
or 
fraud. 
Our 
audits 
included 
performing 
procedures 
to 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
 misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error 
or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond 
to 
 those 
risks. 
Such 
procedures 
included 
examining, 
on 
a 
test 
basis, 
evidence 
regarding 
the 
amounts 
and 
disclosures 
in 
the 
 consolidated financial 
statements. Our 
audits also 
included evaluating 
the accounting 
principles used 
and significant 
estimates 
 made 
by management, 
as well 
as evaluating 
the overall 
presentation 
of the 
consolidated financial 
statements. We 
believe 
our 
 audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter
 The 
critical 
audit 
matter 
communicated 
below 
is 
a 
matter 
arising 
from 
the 
current 
period 
audit 
of 
the 
consolidated 
 financial 
statements 
that 
were 
communicated 
or 
required 
to 
be 
communicated 
to 
the 
Audit 
Committee 
and 
that: 
(1) 
relate 
to 
 accounts 
or disclosures 
that are 
material 
to the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements and 
(2) involved 
our especially 
challenging, 
 subjective, or 
complex judgments. The 
communication of 
the critical audit 
matter does 
not alter in 
any way 
our opinion on 
the 
 consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, 
providing 
 a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to 
which it relates. 
 Contingent Liabilities Litigation and Claims Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
 Critical Audit Matter Description
 Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they 
 can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. 
Where the reasonable estimate of the probable 
 loss is a range, Cal-Maine 
Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record 
the most likely estimate of 
the loss, or the low end of 
the range if 
 there is no one best estimate. 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries either disclose the 
amount of a possible loss 
or range of loss 

36 
 in 
excess 
of 
established 
accruals 
if 
estimable, 
or 
states 
that 
such 
an 
estimate 
cannot 
be 
made. 
Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. 
and 
 Subsidiaries disclose significant 
legal proceedings and 
claims even where 
liability is not 
probable or the 
amount of the 
liability 
 is not 
estimable, or 
both, if 
Cal-Maine Foods, 
Inc. and 
Subsidiaries believe 
there is 
at least 
a reasonable 
possibility that 
a loss 
 may be incurred. 
 We identified litigation and claims as a critical 
audit matter because of the challenges 
auditing management s judgments 
 applied 
in 
determining 
the 
likelihood 
of 
loss 
related 
to 
the 
resolution 
of 
such 
claims. 
Specifically, 
auditing 
management s 
 determination of 
whether any 
contingent loss 
arising from 
the related 
litigation and 
claims is 
probable, reasonably 
possible, or 
 remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment 
due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during 
the Audit 
 Addressing the 
matter involved 
performing procedures 
and evaluating 
audit evidence 
in connection 
with forming 
our 
 overall 
opinion 
on 
the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
These 
procedures 
included 
testing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
controls 
 relating to the 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 
and Subsidiaries evaluation 
of the 
liability related 
to legal 
proceedings and claims, 
including 
 controls over determining the likelihood 
of a loss 
and whether the amount 
of loss can be 
reasonably estimated, as well 
as financial 
 statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims. 
These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating 
the letters 
 of audit inquiry with external 
legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries assessment 
 regarding 
whether 
an 
unfavorable 
outcome 
is 
reasonably 
possible 
or 
probable, 
and 
reasonably 
estimable, 
evaluating 
the 
 sufficiency 
of Cal-Maine 
Foods, Inc. 
and Subsidiaries 
disclosures 
related 
to legal 
proceedings and 
claims and 
evaluating 
the 
 completeness and accuracy of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries legal 
contingencies.

 Other Postretirement Employee Benefits 
 The Company 
maintains an 
unfunded postretirement 
medical plan to 
provide limited 
health benefits to 
certain qualified 
retired 
 employees 
and officers. 
Retired non-officers 
and 
spouses are 
eligible for 
coverage 
until attainment 
of Medicare 
eligibility, 
at 
 which time coverage 
ceases. Retired officers 
and spouses 
are eligible for 
lifetime benefits under 
the plan. Officers, 
who retired 
 prior to May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare 
Plans A and B. Officers, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 
 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. 

 The plan is accounted for 
in accordance with ASC 
715, Compensation Retirement Benefits ASC 
715 ), whereby an employer 
 recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as 
an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded 
 status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, 
this expense is recognized on an accrual basis 
 over the employees approximate period of employment. The liability associated with the plan was 

million and

death benefit for 
 a 
select 
group 
of 
management 
or 
highly 
compensated 
employees 
of 
the 
Company. 
Provided 
the

becomes vested in 
the retirement benefit 
over

 will be 
accelerated to

a participant 
dies while 
employed, he 
or she 
will not 
receive any

the SERP, 
but 
 their beneficiaries 
will instead be 
entitled to the 
life insurance benefit 
provided under 
the Split Dollar 
Plan, which 
is 500,000.

 On May 
26, 2023, 
we entered 
into the 
First Amendment 
(the Amendment 
to the 
Amended and 
Restated Credit 
Agreement, 
 dated November 15, 2021 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). 
The Amendment replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate 
 interest rate benchmark 
with the secured overnight 
financing rate as administered 
by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York 
or 
 a successor 
administrator 
of the 
secured overnight 
financing 
rate SOFR ). 
The Credit 
Agreement 
has a 
 five
 -year term. 
The 
 Credit 
Agreement 
provides 
for 
a 
senior 
secured 
revolving 
credit 
facility 
(the 
 Credit 
Facility 
or 
 Revolver 
in 
an 
initial 
 aggregate principal 
amount of 
up to 

million, which 
includes a 

million sublimit 
for the 
issuance of 
standby letters 
of 
 credit and a 

million sublimit for swingline loans. 
The Credit Facility also includes 
an accordion feature permitting, with the 
 consent of BMO 
Harris Bank N.A. 
(the Administrative 
Agent ), an increase 
in the Credit 
Facility in the 
aggregate up to 

million by adding one or more 
incremental senior secured term loans or increasing one 
or more times the revolving commitments 
 under the Revolver. 

amounts were borrowed 
under the facility 
as of June 
3, 2023 or 
May 28, 2022 
or during fiscal 
2023 or 

53 

million of 
outstanding standby 
letters of 
credit issued 
under the 
Credit Facility 
at June 
3, 
 2023. 
 The 
interest 
rate 
in 
connection 
with 
loans 
made 
under 
the 
Credit 
Facility 
is 
based 
on, 
at 
the 
Company s 
election, 
either 
the 
 Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the 
Applicable Margin or the 
Base Rate plus 
the Applicable Margin. The Adjusted 
Term SOFR 
 means with respect to any tenor, 
the per annum rate equal to the sum of 
(i) Term 
SOFR as defined in the Credit Agreement 
plus 
 (ii) 
 
 (10 basis 
points); provided, 
if Adjusted Term 
SOFR determined 
as provided above 
shall ever be 
less than the 
Floor, 
 then Adjusted 
Term 
SOFR shall 
be deemed 
to be 
the Floor. 
The Floor 
means the 
rate per 
annum of 
interest equal 
to 
 
 . 
 The Base Rate means a fluctuating rate per annum 
equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate 
plus 
 
 per annum, (b) 
 the prime rate of 
interest established by the 
Administrative Agent, and 
(c) the Adjusted Term 
SOFR for a 
 one
 -month tenor plus 
 
 . The 
 Applicable Margin 
means 
 
 to 
 
 per 
annum for 
Base Rate 
Loans and 
 
 to 
 
 per 
annum for 
 SOFR Loans, in 
each case depending upon 
the Total Funded Debt to 
Capitalization Ratio for the 
Company at the quarterly 
pricing 
 date. The 
Company will 
pay a 
commitment 
fee on 
the unused 
portion 
of the 
Credit Facility 
payable quarterly 
from 
 
 to 
 
 in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. 

 The 
Credit 
Facility 
is 
guaranteed 
by 
all the 
current 
and 
future wholly 
-owned 
direct 
and 
indirect 
domestic 
subsidiaries 
of 
the 
 Company (the 
 Guarantors ), and 
is secured 
by a 
first-priority perfected 
security interest 
in substantially 
all of 
the Company s 
 and the Guarantors accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including 
 farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent. 
 The 
Credit 
Agreement 
for the 
Credit 
Facility 
contains 
customary 
covenants, 
including 
restrictions 
on 
the incurrence 
of 
liens, 
 incurrence of 
additional debt, 
sales of 
assets and 
other fundamental 
corporate changes 
and investments. 
The Credit 
Agreement 
 requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested 
quarterly of no 
 greater than 
 
 ; and (ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum 
Tangible Net 
Worth at 
all times of 

Million plus 
 
 of net 
 income 
(if 
net 
income 
is 
positive) 
less 
permitted 
restricted 
payments 
for 
each 
fiscal 
quarter 
after 
November 
27, 
2021. 
 Additionally, 
the Credit Agreement 
requires that Fred 
R. Adams Jr. s 
spouse, natural children, 
sons-in-law or grandchildren, 
or 
 any trust, 
guardianship, conservatorship 
or custodianship 
for the primary 
benefit of any 
of the foregoing, 
or any family 
limited 
 partnership, similar limited liability 
company or other entity 
that 
 
 of the voting control 
of such entity is held 
by any of the 
 foregoing, shall maintain 
at least 
 
 of the Company's 
voting stock. Failure 
to satisfy any of 
these covenants will constitute 
a 
 default under the terms of 
the Credit Agreement. Further, 
under the terms of the Credit 
Agreement, payment of dividends under 
 the 
Company's 
current 
dividend 
policy 
of 
one-third 
of 
the 
Company's 
net 
income 
computed 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP 
and 
 payment of other 
dividends or repurchases 
by the Company 
of its capital stock 
is allowed, as long 
as after giving 
effect to such 
 dividend 
payments or 
repurchases no 
default has 
occurred and 
is continuing 
and 
the sum 
of cash 
and cash 
equivalents of 
the 
 Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals at least 

million. 
 The Credit 
Agreement also 
includes customary 
events of 
default and 
customary remedies 
upon the 
occurrence of 
an event 
of 
 default, including acceleration 
of the amounts due 
under the Credit Facility 
and foreclosure of

in damages. On August 13, 
 2020, the 
court granted 
the defendants 
motion to 
dismiss the 
State s 
original petition 
with prejudice. 
On September 
11, 2020, 
 the State filed a 
notice of appeal, 
which was assigned 
to the Texas 
Court of Appeals 
for the First District. 
On August 16, 
2022, 
 the 
appeals 
court 
reversed 
and 
remanded 
the 
case 
back 
to 
the 
trial 
court 
for 
further 
proceedings. 
On 
October 
31, 
2022, 
the 
 Company and WCF appealed the First District Court s decision to the Supreme Court of Texas. 
On May 10, 2023, the Company 
 filed its brief on the merits, 
and the State of Texas 
filed its brief on June 29, 2023. 
The Company filed its reply brief on July 
14, 
 2023. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. 
 Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al. 

 On April 30, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:20-
 cv-461, in the Western 
District of Texas, Austin 
Division. The defendants include numerous grocery 
stores, retailers, producers, 
 and farms. 
Plaintiffs assert 
that defendants 
violated the 
DTPA 
by allegedly 
demanding exorbitant 
or excessive 
prices for 
eggs 
 during the COVID-19 state of 
emergency. Plaintiffs request certification of a class of all consumers who 
purchased eggs in Texas 
 sold, 
distributed, 
produced, 
or handled 
by any 
of the 
defendants 
during 
the COVID-19 
state of 
emergency. 
Plaintiffs 
seek 
to 
 enjoin the Company 
and other defendants from 
selling eggs at a 
price more than 
10 greater than 
the price of eggs 
prior to the 
 declaration 
of 
the 
state 
of 
emergency 
and 
damages 
in 
the 
amount 
of 

per 
violation, 
or 

for 
each 
violation 
 impacting anyone over 65 years old. On December 
1, 2020, the Company and certain other defendants 
filed a motion to dismiss 
 the plaintiffs amended class action complaint. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to strike, and the motion to dismiss and 
 related proceedings were referred to a United States magistrate judge. On July 14, 2021, the magistrate judge issued a report and 
 recommendation to 
the court that 
the defendants motion 
to dismiss be 
granted and the 
case be dismissed 
without prejudice for 
 lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 20, 2021, the court dismissed the case without prejudice. On July 13, 2022, the 
 court denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside or amend 
the judgment to amend their complaint. 
 On March 15, 2022, 
plaintiffs filed a 
second suit against the 
Company and several 
defendants in Bell et 
al. v. 
Cal-Maine Foods 
 et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-246, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division alleging 
the same assertions as laid out in the first 
 complaint. On August 12, 
2022, the Company and 
other defendants in 
the case filed 
a motion to 
dismiss the plaintiffs class 
action 
 complaint. On January 9, 2023, the court entered an order and final judgement 
granting the Company s motion 
to dismiss. 

 On February 
8, 2023, 
the plaintiffs 
appealed 
the lower 
court s 
judgement 
to the 
United States 
Court of 
Appeals for 
the Fifth 
 Circuit, Case No. 
23-50112. 
The parties filed 
their respective appellate 
briefs, but the 
court has not 
ruled on these 
submissions. 
 Management believes the risk of material loss related to both matters to be remote. 
 Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. 
United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. 

 As previously 
reported, on 
September 25, 
2008, the 
Company 
was named 
as one 
of several 
defendants 
in numerous 
antitrust 
 cases involving 
the United 
States shell 
egg 
industry. 
The Company 
settled all 
of these 
cases, except 
for 
the claims 
of certain 
 plaintiffs who sought substantial 
damages allegedly arising from 
the purchase of egg products (as 
opposed to shell eggs). 
These 
 remaining plaintiffs 
are Kraft Food 
Global, Inc., 
General Mills, Inc., 
and Nestle USA, 
Inc. (the 
 Egg Products 
Plaintiffs and, 
 until a subsequent settlement was reached as described below, 
The Kellogg Company. 

59 

of the membership 
interests of 
Benton County Foods, 
LLC, which is 
an ongoing commercial 
shell egg operation 
within the Illinois 
 River 
Watershed. 
Benton 
County 
Foods, 
LLC 
is 
not 
a 
defendant 
in 
the 
litigation. 
We 
also 
have 
a 
number 
of 
small 
contract 
 producers that operate in the area. 
 The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 
and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered 
 findings of 
fact and 
conclusions of 
law in favor 
of the 
State of 
Oklahoma, but 
no penalties 
were assessed. 
The court 
found the 
 defendants liable for state law nuisance, federal 
common law nuisance, and state law 
trespass. The court also found the 
producers 
 vicariously liable for the actions of 
their contract producers. The court directed the 
parties to confer in attempt to 
reach agreement 
 on appropriate remedies. On June 12, 2023, the court ordered the 
parties to mediate before the Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Deanell 
 Reece Tacha 
and instructed the parties 
to file a joint 
status report fourteen days 
following mediation. The 
mediation has not yet 
 been set but is expected to be in the September to October time frame this fall. While management believes 
there is a reasonable 
 possibility of a material loss from the case, at the present 
time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of 
monetary exposure, if 
 any, 
to the Company 
due to a 
range of factors, 
including the following, 
among others: uncertainties 
inherent in any 
assessment 
 of potential costs 
associated with injunctive 
relief or other 
penalties based on 
a decision in 
a case tried over 
13 years ago based 
 on 
environmental 
conditions 
that 
existed 
at 
the 
time, 
the 
lack 
of 
guidance 
from 
the 
court 
as 
to 
what 
might 
be 
considered 
 appropriate remedies, the ongoing negotiations with the State on appropriate remedies and upcoming mediation, 
and uncertainty 
 regarding 
what 
our 
proportionate 
share 
of 
any 
remedy 
would 
be, 
although 
we 
believe 
that 
our 
share 
compared 
to 
the 
other 
 defendants is small. 
 Other Matters 
 In addition to 
the above, the Company 
is involved in 
various other claims 
and litigation incidental 
to its business. Although 
the 
 outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, 
is of the opinion that the 
 final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company s 
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 (a) 
Management s Report 
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The following 
sets forth, 
in accordance 
with Section 
404(a) of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 
2002 and 
Item 308 
of the 
Securities 
 and Exchange Commission s Regulation 
S-K, the report of management on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 1.
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting. 
 Internal control over financial reporting 
is a process designed 
by, or under the supervision of, our 
Chief Executive 
 Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, 
together with other financial 
officers, and effected 
by our Board of 
Directors, 
 management 
and other 
personnel, to 
provide reasonable 
assurance 
regarding the 
reliability of 
financial reporting 
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting 
 principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
 and dispositions of our assets; 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
 statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles, 
and 
that 
our 
receipts 
and 
 expenditures are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of our management and directors; and 
 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
 disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements. 
 2. 
Our 
management, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
13a-15(c) 
under the 
Exchange 
Act 
and 
with the 
participation 
of 
our 
 Chief 
Executive 
Officer 
and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
together 
with 
other 
financial 
officers, 
evaluated 
the 
 effectiveness 
of 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as 
of 
June 
3, 
2023. The 
framework 
on 
which 
 management s 
evaluation 
of 
our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
based 
is 
the 
 Internal 
Control 
 
 Integrated 
Framework 
 published 
in 
2013 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
Sponsoring 
Organizations COSO 
of 
the 
 Treadway Commission. 
 3. 
Management has 
determined that 
our internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
as of June 
3, 2023 
is effective. 
It is 
 noted 
that 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
cannot 
provide 
absolute 
assurance 
of 
achieving 
financial 
 reporting objectives, but rather reasonable assurance of achieving 
such objectives.

by

 Organizations of

Commission COSO ). 
In our 
opinion, Cal-Maine 
Foods, Inc. and 
Subsidiaries maintained, 
in 
 all material 
respects, 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
as June 
3, 2023, 
based 
on 
criteria 
established 
in 
2013 
 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. 
 We 
also have 
audited, in 
accordance with 
the standards 
of the 
Public Company 
Accounting Oversight 
Board (United 
 States) PCAOB ), the consolidated 
balance sheets and the 
related consolidated statements of 
income, comprehensive income, 
 stockholders equity, 
and cash flows of Cal-Maine Foods, 
Inc. and Subsidiaries and our 
report dated July 25, 2023 expressed 
an 
 unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. 
and 
Subsidiaries 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
maintaining 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
 financial 
reporting, 
and 
for 
their 
assessment 
of 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
included 
in 
the 
 accompanying Management s 
Report on Internal 
Control Over Financial 
Reporting in Item 9A. 
Our responsibility is 
to express 
 an opinion on the entities internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered 
 with the PCAOB and 
are required to be 
independent with respect to 
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 
and Subsidiaries in accordance 
with 
 the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws and 
the 
applicable 
rules 
and 
regulations 
of the 
Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission 
and 
the 
 PCAOB. 
 We 
conducted 
our 
audit in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
of 
the 
PCOAB. Those 
standards 
require 
that 
we 
plan 
and 
 perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained 
 in 
all material 
respects. 
Our audit 
of internal 
control over 
financial 
reporting 
included 
obtaining 
an understanding 
of internal 
 control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
assessing the 
risk 
that 
a 
material 
weakness 
exists, 
and 
testing 
and 
evaluating 
the design 
and 
 operating effectiveness 
of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. 
Our audit also included 
performing such other procedures 
 as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
An entities internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
 reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
 accounting principles 
generally accepted 
in the 
United States 
of America. 
An entities 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting 
 includes those 
policies and 
procedures that 
(1) pertain 
to the 
maintenance 
of records 
that, in 
reasonable detail, 
accurately and 
 fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the 
entities; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are 
 recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
preparation 
of 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
accounting 
principles 
 generally 
accepted 
in the 
United States 
of America, 
and 
that receipts 
and 
expenditures 
of the 
entities are 
being 
made only 
in 
 accordance 
with 
authorizations 
of 
management 
and 
directors 
of 
the 
entities; 
and 
(3) 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
 prevention or 
timely detection 
of unauthorized 
acquisition, use, 
or disposition 
of the 
entities assets 
that could 
have a 
material 
 effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Because of 
its inherent 
limitations, internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
may not 
prevent or 
detect misstatements. 
 Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate 
 because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 4.1 
 To Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2023 
 Of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 The amount of capital stock which Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (the Company or Corporation 
is authorized to issue (the Capital 
 Stock is 124,800,000 
shares, consisting of 
(a) 120,000,000 shares 
of Common 
Stock with a 
par value 
of One Cent .01) per 
 share and (b) 4,800,000 shares of Class A Common Stock with a par value of One Cent .01) per share. 
 The 
following 
summary 
describes 
the 
Capital 
Stock 
under 
the 
Company s 
Second 
Amended 
and 
Restated 
Certificate 
of 
 Incorporation (the Restated 
Charter ). The summary may 
not be complete and 
is subject to, and 
qualified in its entirety 
by, the 
 applicable provisions 
of Delaware 
law and 
the terms and 
provisions of 
our Restated 
Charter. You should 
refer to, and 
read this 
 summary together 
with, our 
Restated Charter 
to review 
all provisions 
applicable to 
our Capital 
Stock that 
may be important 
to 
 you. 
 Equal Treatment 
 Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Charter 
as described below, or required by applicable 
law, shares of Common Stock 
 and Class A 
Common Stock shall have the same rights and powers, rank equally (including as to dividends and distributions, and 
 upon any 
liquidation, dissolution 
or winding 
up of 
the Corporation), 
share ratably 
and be 
identical in 
all respects 
and as 
to all 
 matters. 
 Voting Rights 
 Holders of shares of Capital Stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of 
 Common Stock entitled to one vote 
and each share of Class A 
Common Stock entitled to ten votes. 
Holders of Capital Stock have 
 the right 
of cumulative 
voting in 
the election 
of directors. 
Cumulative voting 
means that 
each stockholder 
is entitled 
to cast 
as 
 many votes as he 
or she has the right 
to cast (before cumulating 
votes), multiplied by the 
number of directors to 
be elected, and 
 such stockholder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute 
them among the number to be voted for, or for 
 any two or more of them as such stockholder may see fit. 
 Under Delaware 
law, the affirmative 
vote of the 
holders of a 
majority of the 
outstanding shares of 
any class of 
Capital Stock is 
 required to approve, among other 
things, any amendment to the 
certificate of incorporation that would 
alter or change the 
powers, 
 preferences 
or special 
rights of 
such class 
so as 
to affect 
such class 
adversely. In 
addition, as 
long as 
any of 
the shares 
of the 
 Class A Common 
Stock are 
outstanding, 
the consent 
of not 
less than 
66 2/3 
 of 
the total 
shares of 
Class A Common 
Stock 
 outstanding is required to 
(1) alter or change the rights 
and privileges of Class A Common Stock; 
(2) to amend any provision of 
 Paragraph 4 of the Restated Charter affecting the Class A 
Common Stock or (3) effect any re-classification or re-capitalization of 
 the Company s Capital Stock. 
 Dividends 
 Holders of 
shares of 
Capital Stock 
are entitled 
to receive 
such dividends 
as may 
be declared 
by our 
Board of 
Directors out 
of 
 funds legally available for such purpose. 
 Shares of Common 
Stock and Class A Common 
Stock are required 
to be treated 
equally, identically 
and ratably, 
on a per 
share 
 basis, with respect to any dividends or distributions as may be declared and paid from time to time by the Board of Directors out 
 of any assets of the Company legally available therefor. 
 However, in the event a dividend is paid in the form 
of shares of Capital Stock (or rights to acquire such shares), 
then holders of 
 Common Stock shall receive 
shares of Common Stock 
(or rights) and holders of 
Class A Common Stock shall receive shares of 
 Class A Common 
Stock (or 
rights), with 
holders of 
shares of 
Common Stock 
and Class A Common 
Stock receiving, 
on a 
per 
 share basis, an identical number of shares of Common Stock or Class A Common Stock, as applicable. 

Exhibit 4.1 
 To Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2023 
 Of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
Board of Directors may 
pay or make a 
disparate dividend or distribution per 
share of Common 
 Stock or Class A Common 
Stock (whether 
in the amount 
of such dividend 
or distribution payable 
per share, 
the form 
in which 
 such dividend 
or distribution 
is payable, 
the timing 
of the 
payment, 
or otherwise) 
if such 
disparate dividend 
or distribution 
is 
 approved in advance by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class 
A 
 Common Stock, each voting separately as a class.

 Control by Immediate Family Members, Anti-Takeover Considerations and Conflicts of Interest 
 General 
 Mr. Adams founded the Company 
and served as its CEO 
from the formation 
of the Company in 1969 
until 2010, when his son-
 in-law, Mr. Baker, 
became CEO. 
Mr. Adams died 
on March 
29, 2020. 
Mr. Baker 
stepped down 
from CEO 
in September 
2022, 
 and remains Chairman of the Board and as an executive officer of the Company. 
 As of July 25, 2023, 
Immediate Family Members beneficially own all of 
the 4.8 million outstanding shares of Class A Common 
 Stock, representing 52.1 of the total voting power, and approximately 1.6 million 
shares of Common Stock, representing 1.8 
 of the total voting power. Such persons possess in the aggregate 53.8 of the total voting power of the outstanding 
shares of our 
 Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, based on shares held directly or through related entities. 
 The Common Stock is 
listed on The 
Nasdaq Stock Market NASDAQ ). 
Because Mr. Baker 
and Mr. Baker s 
spouse beneficially 
 own in the 
aggregate capital stock 
of the Company 
entitling them to 
53.8 of the 
total voting power, 
the Company is 
a controlled 
 company under 
NASDAQ rules. As a 
controlled company, 
the Company 
is not 
subject to 
certain NASDAQ 
listing standards, 
 such as those that would otherwise 
require that a majority of a 
listed company s directors be independent and that 
a compensation 
 committee and nominating 
committee of the 
board of directors 
composed solely of 
independent directors be 
established. Although 
 not 
required, 
the 
Company s 
board 
does 
comprise 
of 
a 
majority 
of 
independent 
directors 
and 
Compensation 
committee 
is

on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2023 
 Of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 

comprised of all solely independent directors. The Company 
is, however, subject to NASDAQ listing standards requiring that 
the 
 Audit Committee be composed solely 
of independent directors. Delaware law 
provides that the holders of 
a majority of the 
voting 
 power of shares entitled to vote 
must approve certain fundamental corporate transactions such as 
a merger, consolidation and sale 
 of all or substantially 
all of a corporation s 
assets. Immediate Family 
Members currently hold a 
majority of the voting 
power of 
 all 
shares 
of 
capital 
stock 
of 
the 
Company 
and 
have 
indicated 
that 
they 
intend 
to 
retain 
ownership 
of 
a 
sufficient 
amount of 
 Common 
Stock 
and 
Class A 
Common 
Stock 
to 
assure 
continued 
ownership 
of 
more 
than 
50 
of 
the 
voting 
power 
of 
our 
 outstanding 
shares 
of capital 
stock. Accordingly, 
a merger, 
consolidation, 
sale of 
all or 
substantially 
all of 
the assets 
or 
other 
 business combination 
or transaction 
involving the 
Company, which 
requires a 
stockholder vote, 
cannot be 
effected without 
the 
 approval of the Immediate Family Members. 
 As a result, majority control may make an unsolicited acquisition of 
the Company more difficult and discourage certain types 
of 
 transactions involving a change of control of our Company, including transactions in which the holders of Common Stock might 
 otherwise receive a premium for 
their shares over then 
current market prices. 
Also, the controlling ownership of 
our Capital Stock 
 by Immediate Family 
Members may adversely 
affect the market 
price of our 
Common Stock, due 
in part to 
lack of speculation 
 that there may be a change in control. 
 Delaware Anti-Takeover Law 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
Section 203 Section 203 
of 
the 
Delaware 
General 
Corporation 
Law. 
Under 
this 
provision, 
we 
may 
not 
 engage 
in 
any 
 business 
combination 
with 
any 
interested 
stockholder 
for 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years 
following 
the 
date 
the 
 stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: 
 i. 
prior to that date our Board of Directors approved either the business combination 
or the transaction that resulted in the 
 stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; 
 ii. 
upon completion 
of the 
transaction that 
resulted in 
the stockholder 
becoming an 
interested stockholder, 
the interested 
 stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock outstanding at the 
time the transaction began; or 
 iii. 
on or following 
that date, the business 
combination is approved 
by our Board of 
Directors and authorized 
at an annual 
 or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding 
voting stock that is not owned 
 by the interested stockholder. 
 Section 203 defines business combination to include, subject to limited exceptions: 
 i. 
any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; 
 ii. 
any sale, 
transfer, pledge 
or other 
disposition of 
10 or 
more of 
the assets 
of the 
corporation involving 
the interested 
 stockholder; 
 iii. 
any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested 
 stockholder; 
 iv. 
any transaction 
involving the 
corporation 
that has 
the effect 
of increasing 
the proportionate 
share of 
the stock 
of any 
 class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or 
 v. 
the receipt 
by the 
interested 
stockholder of 
the benefit 
of any 
loans, advances, 
guarantees, pledges 
or other 
financial 
 benefits provided by or through the corporation. 

Exhibit 4.1 
 To Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2023 
 Of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 

In 
general, 
Section 203 
defines 
an 
 interested 
stockholder 
as 
any 
entity 
or 
person 
beneficially 
owning 
15 
or 
more 
of 
the 
 outstanding voting 
stock of the 
corporation and 
any entity 
or person affiliated 
with or controlling 
or controlled 
by the entity 
or 
 person. 
 The restrictions of 
Section 203 of the 
Delaware General Corporation 
Law do not 
apply to corporations 
that have elected, 
in the 
 manner provided therein, not to be subject to Section 203 of 
the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company has 
not made 
 such an election. Accordingly, the Company would be subject to Section 203 in the event of a business combination.

 notwithstanding, the undertaking of the Swingline Lender to make Swingline 
Loans shall be subject to all of the terms and 
 conditions of this Agreement (provided that the Swingline Lender shall be 
entitled to assume that the conditions precedent to an 
 advance of any Swingline Loan have been satisfied unless notified to the 
contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Required 
 Lenders). 

(c) 
 Refunding Swingline Loans
 . 
In its sole and absolute discretion, the Swingline Lender may at any time, on 
 behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline 
Lender to act on its behalf for such purpose) and 
 with notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, request each Lender 
to make a Revolving Loan in the form of a Base 
 Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Revolver 
Percentage of the amount of the Swingline Loans outstanding on the 
 date such notice is given (which Loans shall thereafter bear interest as provided 
for in Section 2.4(a)). 
Unless an Event of 
 Default described in Section 9.1(j) or 9.1(k)
 exists with respect to the Borrower, regardless of the 
existence of any other Event 
 of Default, each Lender shall make the proceeds of its requested Revolving Loan 
available to the Administrative Agent for the 
 account of the Swingline Lender), in immediately available funds, at the 
Administrative Agent s office 
in Chicago, Illinois (or 
 such other location designated by the Administrative Agent), before 12:00 
Noon (Chicago time) on the Business Day following 
 the day such notice is given. 
The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit the proceeds of such 
Borrowing to the Swingline 
 Lender to repay the outstanding Swingline Loans. 
 
(d) 
 Participation in Swingline Loans. 

 If any Lender refuses or otherwise fails to make a Revolving Loan when 
 requested by the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.2(b) above
 (because an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(j) or 
 9.1(k)
 exists with respect to the Borrower or otherwise), such Lender will, by the time and in the 
manner such Revolving Loan 
 was to have been funded to the Swingline Lender, 
purchase from the Swingline Lender an undivided participating interest in 
 the outstanding Swingline Loans in an amount equal to its Revolver Percentage 
of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline 
 Loans that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans. 
From and after the date of any such purchase, the parties 
 hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that such Swingline Loans shall thereafter 
bear interest at the rate for such Swingline 
 Loan as determined in accordance with Section 2.2(b) hereof. 
Each Lender that so purchases a participation in a Swingline 
 Loan shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Revolver Percentage of 
each payment of principal received on the Swingline 
 Loan and of interest received thereon accruing from the date such Lender funded 
to the Swingline Lender its participation in 
 such Loan. 
The several obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall be absolute, irrevocable, 
and unconditional under 
 any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set-off, 
counterclaim or defense to payment which any 
 Lender may have or have had against the Borrower, 
any other Lender, or any other Person whatsoever. 
Without limiting the 
 generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected 
by any Default or by any reduction or termination of the 
 Commitments of any Lender, and each payment 
made by a Lender under this Section shall be made without any offset, 
 abatement, withholding, or reduction whatsoever.
 
(e) 
 Sweep to Loan Arrangement
 . 
So long as a Sweep to Loan Arrangement is in effect, and subject to the 
terms and 
 conditions thereof, Swingline Loans may be advanced and prepaid 
hereunder notwithstanding any notice, minimum amount, or 
 funding and payment location requirements hereunder for any advance 
of Swingline Loans or for any prepayment of any 
 Swingline Loans. 
The making of any such Swingline Loans shall otherwise be subject to the other terms and 
conditions of this 
 Agreement. The Swingline Lender shall have the right in its sole discretion to 
suspend or terminate the making and/or 
 prepayment of Swingline Loans pursuant to such Sweep to Loan Arrangement 
with notice to the Sweep Depositary and the 
 Borrower (which may be provided on a same-day basis), whether or not 
any Default exists. 
The Swingline Lender shall not be 
 liable to the Borrower or any other Person for any losses directly or indirectly resulting 
from events beyond the Swingline 
 Lender s reasonable control, including without limitation 
any interruption of communications or data processing services or 
 legal restriction or for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages 
in connection with any Sweep to Loan 
 Arrangement. 
 Section 2.3. 
Letters of Credit.
 
(a) 
 General Terms.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as part of the Revolving 
Facility, the L/C Issuer 
 shall issue standby and commercial letters of credit (each a 
 Letter of Credit) for the account of the Borrower
 or for the 
 account of the Borrower and one or more of its Subsidiaries
 in an aggregate undrawn face amount up to the L/C Sublimit. 
Each 
 Letter of Credit shall be issued by the L/C Issuer, 
but each Lender shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer for such 
 Lender s Revolver Percentage of the amount of each drawing 
thereunder and, accordingly, 
Letters of Credit shall constitute 
 usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender pro rata in 
an amount equal to its Revolver Percentage of the L/C 
 Obligations then outstanding. 

(b) 
 Applications.
 
At any time before the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, the L/C Issuer shall, at the request of 
 the Borrower, issue one or more Letters of Credit
 in U.S. Dollars, in a form satisfactory to the L/C Issuer, with 
expiration dates 
 no later than the earlier of 12 months from the date of issuance (or which are 
cancelable not later than 12 months from the date 
 of issuance and each renewal) or thirty (30) days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, in an aggregate face amount 
 as set forth above, upon the receipt of an application duly executed by the Borrower 
and, if such Letter of Credit is for the 
 account of one of its Subsidiaries, such Subsidiary
 for the relevant Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by 
 the L/C Issuer for the Letter of Credit requested (each an 
 Application). 
The Borrower agrees that if on the Revolving Credit 
 Termination 
Date any Letters of Credit remain outstanding the Borrower shall then deliver to the 
Administrative Agent, without 
 notice or demand, Cash Collateral in an amount equal to 105 of the aggregate 
amount of each Letter of Credit then 
 outstanding (which shall be held by the Administrative Agent pursuant 
to the terms of Section 9.4). 
Notwithstanding anything 
 contained in any Application to the contrary: 
(i) the Borrower shall pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit as set 
 forth in Section 3.1, (ii) except as otherwise provided herein or in Sections 2.8, 2.13 or 2.14, 
unless an Event of Default exists, 
 the L/C Issuer will not call for the funding by the Borrower of any amount 
under a Letter of Credit before being presented with 
 a drawing thereunder, and (iii) if the L/C Issuer is not 
timely reimbursed for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit 
 on the date such drawing is paid, except as otherwise provided for in Section 2.6(c), 
the Borrower s obligation to reimburse the 
 L/C Issuer for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which the 
Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after the 
 date such drawing is paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable 
Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in 
 effect (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, 
as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed). 
If the 
 L/C Issuer issues any Letter of Credit with an expiration date that is automatically 
extended unless the L/C Issuer gives notice 
 that the expiration date will not so extend beyond its then scheduled expiration 
date, unless the Administrative Agent or the 
 Required Lenders instruct the L/C Issuer otherwise, the L/C Issuer will give 
such notice of non-renewal before the time 
 necessary to prevent such automatic extension if before such required notice date: 
(i) the expiration date of such Letter of 
 Credit if so extended would be after the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, (ii) the Revolving Credit Commitments have been 
 terminated, or (iii) an Event of Default exists and either the Administrative 
Agent or the Required Lenders (with notice to the 
 Administrative Agent) have given the L/C Issuer instructions not to so permit 
the extension of the expiration date of such Letter 
 of Credit. 
The L/C Issuer agrees to issue amendments to the Letter(s) of Credit increasing the amount, 
or extending the 
 expiration date, thereof at the request of the Borrower subject to the 
conditions of Section 7 and the other terms of this Section. 

(c) 
 The Reimbursement Obligations.
 
Subject to Section 2.3(b), the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C 
 Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit (a 
 Reimbursement Obligation) shall be governed by the Application related to 
 such Letter of Credit, except that reimbursement shall be made (i) by no later than 2:00 
p.m. (Chicago time) on the date when 
 each drawing is to be paid if the Borrower has been informed of such drawing by the 
L/C Issuer on or before 10:00 a.m. 
 (Chicago time) on the date when such drawing is to be paid and the Borrower has 
notified the Administrative Agent by 1:00 
 p.m. (Chicago time) on such date that the Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer on the date 
each such drawing is to be paid, 
 or (ii) if notice of such drawing is given to the Borrower after 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the 
date when such drawing is to be 
 paid or if the Borrower fails to notify the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago 
time) on such date that the Borrower will 
 reimburse the L/C Issuer on the date each such drawing is to be paid, by no 
later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the 
 following Business Day, 
in each case, in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent s 
principal office in Chicago, 
 Illinois, or such other office as the Administrative Agent 
may designate in writing to the Borrower (who shall thereafter cause 
 to be distributed to the L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like funds). 
If the Borrower does not make any such reimbursement 
 payment on the date due and the Participating Lenders fund their participations 
therein in the manner set forth in Section 2.3(e) 
 below, then all payments 
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent in discharge 
of any of the relevant Reimbursement 
 Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with Section 2.3(e) below. 

(d) 
 Obligations Absolute.
 
The Borrower s obligation to reimburse L/C Obligations shall be absolute, 
unconditional 
 and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of 
this Agreement and the relevant Application 
 under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any 
lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit 
 or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other 
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving 
 to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement 
therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) 
 payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or 
other document that does not strictly 
 comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance 
whatsoever, whether or not similar to 
 any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal 
or equitable discharge of, or provide a 
 right of setoff against, the Borrower s obligations 
hereunder. None of the Administrative 
Agent, the Lenders, or the L/C Issuer 
 shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with 
the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or 
 any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of 
any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding 
 sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, 
loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other 
 communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including 
any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any 
 error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond 
the control of the L/C Issuer; 
 provided
 that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to the 
Borrower to the extent of any direct 
 damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby 
waived by the Borrower and each other 
 Loan Party to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered 
by the Borrower or any Loan Party that are caused by the L/C 
 Issuer s failure to exercise care when determining 
whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit 
 comply with the terms thereof. 
The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence 
or willful misconduct 
 on the part of the L/C Issuer (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by 
final and nonappealable judgment), the L/C 
 Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. 
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting 
 the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented 
which appear on their face to be in substantial 
 compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer may, 
in its reasonable discretion, either accept and make 
 payment upon such documents without responsibility for further 
investigation, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such 
 documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of 
such Letter of Credit. 

(e) 
 The Participating Interests.
 
Each Lender (other than the Lender acting as L/C Issuer in issuing the relevant 
 Letter of Credit), by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to purchase from the L/C Issuer, 
and the L/C Issuer hereby agrees to 
 sell to each such Lender (a 
 Participating Lender), an undivided percentage participating interest (a 
 Participating Interest , 
 to the extent of its Revolver Percentage, in each Letter of Credit issued by, 
and each Reimbursement Obligation owed to, the 
 L/C Issuer. 
Upon any failure by the Borrower to pay any Reimbursement 
Obligation at the time required on the date the related 
 drawing is to be paid, as set forth in Section 2.3(c) above, or if the L/C Issuer is required 
at any time to return to the Borrower 
 or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, 
custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, 
 each Participating Lender shall, not later than the Business Day it receives a certificate 
in the form of Exhibit A hereto from the 
 L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to such effect, 
if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m. (Chicago 
 time), or not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) the following Business Day, 
if such certificate is received after such time, pay 
 to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer an amount equal 
to such Participating Lender s Revolver 
 Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together 
with interest on such amount accrued from the 
 date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date of such payment 
by such Participating Lender at a rate per 
 annum equal to: 
(i) from the date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date two 
(2) Business Days after 
 payment by such Participating Lender is due hereunder, 
at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the 
 Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank 
compensation for each such day and (ii) from the 
 date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Participating 
Lender to the date such payment is made 
 by such Participating Lender, the Base Rate in effect 
for each such day. 
Each such Participating Lender shall thereafter be 
 entitled to receive its Revolver Percentage of each payment received in 
respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and 
 of interest paid thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Revolver Percentage thereof 
as a Lender hereunder. 
The several 
 obligations of the Participating Lenders to the L/C Issuer under this Section shall 
be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional 
 under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any 
set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which 
 any Participating Lender may have or have had against the Borrower, 
the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or 
 any other Person whatsoever. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
such obligations shall not be affected by any 
 Default or by any reduction or termination of any Commitment of any Lender, 
and each payment by a Participating Lender 
 under this Section shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding 
or reduction whatsoever. 

(f) 
 Indemnification.
 
The Participating Lenders shall, to the extent of their respective Revolver Percentages, 
 indemnify the L/C Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any 
cost, expense (including reasonable 
 counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except 
such as result from such L/C Issuer s gross 
 negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment) that 
 the L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of 
Credit issued by it. 
The obligations of the Participating 
 Lenders under this subsection (f) and all other parts of this Section shall survive 
termination of this Agreement and of all 
 Applications, Letters of Credit, and all drafts and other documents presented 
in connection with drawings thereunder. 

(g) 
 Manner of Requesting a Letter of Credit.
 
The Borrower shall provide at least five (5) Business Days advance 
 written notice to the Administrative Agent of each request for the issuance of a Letter 
of Credit, such notice in each case to be 
 accompanied by an Application for such Letter of Credit properly completed 
and executed by the Borrower and, in the case of 
 an extension or amendment or an increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit, 
a written request therefor, in a form acceptable 
to 
 the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, in 
each case, together with the fees called for by this Agreement. 
The 
 Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer of the Administrative 
Agent s receipt of each such notice (and
 the 
 L/C Issuer shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent to 
any such issuance, extension, amendment or increase 
 have been satisfied unless notified to the contrary by the Administrative Agent 
or the Required Lenders) and the L/C Issuer 
 shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the 
issuance of the Letter of Credit so requested. 

(h) 
 Replacement of the L/C Issuer
 . 
The L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the 
 Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
replaced L/C Issuer, and the successor L/C Issuer. 
The Administrative Agent shall 
 notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the L/C Issuer. 
At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the 
 Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer. 
From and after the effective date of any 
 such replacement (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations 
of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement 
 with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references 
herein to the term L/C Issuer shall be deemed to 
 refer to such successor or to any previous L/C Issuer, 
or to such successor and all previous L/C Issuers, as the context shall 
 require. 
After the replacement of a L/C Issuer hereunder, 
the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue 
 to have all the rights and obligations of a L/C Issuer under this Agreement with 
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to 
 such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
 Section 2.4. 
Applicable Interest Rates.
 
(a) 
 Base Rate Loans.
 
Each Base Rate Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest (computed on 
the 
 basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be (360 days, in the case of clause (c) of the 
definition of Base Rate relating 
 to 
 the LIBOR Quoted Rate
 Adjusted Term 
SOFR), and the actual days elapsed on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the 
 date such Loan is advanced, or created by conversion from a 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or 
 otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin 
plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect, 
 payable by the Borrower on each Interest Payment Date and at maturity (whether 
by acceleration or otherwise). 
 
(b) 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 Loans.
 
Each 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during 
 each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and 
actual days elapsed) on the unpaid 
 principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced or continued, 
or created by conversion from a Base Rate Loan, 
 until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum 
equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the 
 Adjusted 
 LIBOR
 Term SOFR
 
applicable for such Interest Period, payable by the Borrower on each Interest 
Payment Date and at 
 maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). 

(c) 
 Rate Determinations. 
 
The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans and 
 the Reimbursement Obligations hereunder, 
and its determination thereof shall be conclusive and binding except in the 
case of 
 manifest error. 

 In connection with the use or administration of Term 
SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to 
 make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary herein or in any other Loan 
 Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes 
will become effective without any further action or 
 consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the 
 Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming 
Changes in connection with the use or administration of 
 Term SOFR.

 . 
Each Borrowing of Base Rate 
 Loans advanced under a Facility shall be in an amount not less than 100,000. 
Each Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans 
 advanced, continued or converted under a Facility shall be in an amount equal 
to 1,000,000 or such greater amount which is an 
 integral multiple of 500,000. 
Without the Administrative Agent s 
consent, there shall not be more than ten (10) Borrowings of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans outstanding hereunder at any one time. 

Section 2.6. 
Manner of Borrowing Loans and Designating 
Applicable Interest Rates.

(a) 
 Notice to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Borrower shall give notice to the Administrative
 Agent by no later than 
 12:00 noon (Chicago time): 
(i) at least three (3) Business Days before the date on which the Borrower requests the Lenders to 
 advance a Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans and (ii) on the date the Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing 
 of Base Rate Loans. 
The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of 
rate specified in such 
 notice of a new Borrowing. 
Thereafter, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, 
the Borrower may from time to time elect to 
 change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, 
subject to the minimum amount requirement for each 
 outstanding Borrowing set forth in Section 2.5, a portion thereof, as follows: 
(i) if such Borrowing is of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower may 
continue part or all of such Borrowing as 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans or convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or 
(ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate 
 Loans, on any Business Day, 
the Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans for an 
 Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the Borrower. 
The Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance, 
 continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to the Administrative
 Agent by telephone, telecopy, 
or other telecommunication 
 device acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable 
once given and, if by telephone, shall be 
 promptly confirmed in writing in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent), 
substantially in the form attached hereto as 
 Exhibit B (Notice of Borrowing) or Exhibit C (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), 
as applicable, or in such other form 
 acceptable to the Administrative
 Agent. 
Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans for an additional 
 Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans must be given 
 by no later than 12:00 noon (Chicago time) at least three (3) Business Days before 
the date of the requested continuation or 
 conversion. 
All such notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing 
shall specify the date of the 
 requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be 
a Business Day), the amount of the requested 
 Borrowing to be advanced, continued or converted, the type of Loans to comprise 
such new, continued or 
converted Borrowing 
 and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
Upon notice to the 
 Borrower by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, 
in the case of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(j) or 
 9.1(k) with respect to the Borrower, without notice), 
no Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans shall be advanced, continued, or 
 created by conversion if any Default then exists. 
The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may rely on any such 
 telephonic, telecopy or other telecommunication notice given by any person the 
Administrative Agent in good faith believes is 
 an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent 
investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone 
 conflicts with any written confirmation such telephonic notice shall govern 
if the Administrative Agent has acted in reliance 
 thereon. 
 
(b) 
 Notice to the Lenders
 . 
The Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic, telecopy or other 
 telecommunication notice to each Lender of any notice from the Borrower 
received pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above and
 , if
 
the 
 amount of
 
such 
 notice requests the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, the Administrative 
Agent shall give notice to the 
 Borrower and each Lender by like means of the interest rate applicable thereto 
promptly after the Administrative Agent has 
 made such determination
 Lender s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing
 . 
 
(c) 
 Borrower s 
Failure to Notify. 

 If the Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above of the 
 continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans before the last day 
 of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 
2.6(a) and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance 
 with Section 2.8(a), such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into 
a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. 
In the event the 
 Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a) above of a Borrowing 
equal to the amount of a Reimbursement 
 Obligation and has not notified the Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon 
(Chicago time) on the day such Reimbursement 
 Obligation becomes due that it intends to repay such Reimbursement Obligation 
through funds not borrowed under this 
 Agreement, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing 
of Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Facility (or, 
 at the option of the Swingline Lender, under 
the Swingline) on such day in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation then 
 due, which Borrowing shall be applied to pay the Reimbursement Obligation 
then due. 
 
(d) 
 Disbursement of Loans
 . 
Not later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of any requested advance of 
a new 
 Borrowing, subject to Section 7, each Lender shall make available its Loan comprising 
part of such Borrowing in funds 
 immediately available at the principal office of the Administrative 
Agent in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as the 
 Administrative Agent shall designate). 
The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of each new Borrowing 
available to 
 the Borrower at the Administrative Agent s 
principal office in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as the Administrative 
 Agent shall designate), by depositing or wire transferring such proceeds to 
the credit of the Borrower s Designated 
 Disbursement Account or as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent 
may otherwise agree.

(e) 
 Administrative Agent Reliance on Lender Funding.
 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by 
 a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of 
Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on) the date on which such 
 Lender is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds 
of a Loan (which notice shall be effective 
 upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that such Lender 
 has made such payment when due and the Administrative Agent may 
in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be 
 required to) make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such 
Lender and, if any Lender has not in 
 fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, 
pay to the Administrative Agent the 
 amount made available to the Borrower attributable to such Lender 
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during 
 the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to 
the Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date 
 such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal 
to: 
(i) from the date the related advance 
 was made by the Administrative Agent to the date two (2) Business Days after payment 
by such Lender is due hereunder, the 
 greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative 
Agent in accordance with banking industry rules 
 on interbank compensation for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days 
after the date such payment is due 
 from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, 
the Base Rate in effect for each such day. 
If such amount 
 is not received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately 
upon demand, the Borrower will, on demand, repay 
 to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such 
Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal 
 to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such payment being 
considered a payment or prepayment of a 
 Loan under Section 4.5 so that the Borrower will have no liability under such Section 
with respect to such payment. 
Any 
 payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower 
may have against a Lender that shall have failed 
 to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

Loans, in an amount not less 
 than 500,000, and (iii) in each case, in an amount such that the minimum

Business Days prior notice by the Borrower to the 
 Administrative Agent in the case of any prepayment of a Borrowing of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans and notice delivered by the 
 Borrower to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 noon (Chicago 
 time
 Time) on the date of prepayment in the case of a 
 Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (or, in any case, 
such shorter period of time then agreed to by the Administrative Agent), such 
 prepayment to be made by the payment of the principal amount to be prepaid 
and, in the case of any Incremental Term 
Loans, 
 any 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans or Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for 
prepayment plus any amounts 
 due the Lenders under Section 4.5. 

(b) 
 Mandatory
 . 
(i) The Borrower shall, on each date the Revolving Credit Commitments are reduced 
pursuant to 
 Section 2.11, prepay the Swingline Loans, 
Revolving Loans, and, if necessary, 
prefund the L/C Obligations by the amount, if 
 any, necessary to reduce 
the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans, Revolving Loans, 
and L/C Obligations 
 then outstanding to the amount to which the Revolving Credit Commitments have 
been so reduced. 

(ii) 
If the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall at any time or from time to time make or 
agree to make a Disposition 
 (other than a Disposition permitted pursuant to Section 8.10 hereof) or 
shall suffer an Event of Loss with respect to any 
 Property, then the 
Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such proposed Disposition or 
Event of Loss 
 (including the amount of the estimated Net Cash Proceeds to be received by 
the Borrower or such Subsidiary in respect thereof) 
 and, promptly upon receipt by the Borrower or such Subsidiary of 
the Net Cash Proceeds of such Disposition or Event of Loss, 
 the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an aggregate amount 
equal to 100 of the amount of all such Net Cash Proceeds; 
 provided
 
that (x) so long as no Default then exists, this subsection shall not require any such prepayment 
with respect to Net 
 Cash Proceeds received on account of an Event of Loss so long as such Net Cash Proceeds 
are applied to replace or restore the 
 relevant Property in accordance with the relevant Collateral Documents, (y) this 
subsection shall not require any such 
 prepayment with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received on account of Dispositions 
during any fiscal year of the Borrower not 
 exceeding 10,000,000 in the aggregate so long as no Default then exists, and 
(z) in the case of any Disposition not covered by 
 clause (y) above, so long as no Default then exists, if the Borrower states in its notice 
of such event that the Borrower or the 
 relevant Subsidiary intends to reinvest, within 180 days of the applicable 
Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof in assets 
 similar to the assets which were subject to such Disposition, then the Borrower 
shall not be required to make a mandatory 
 prepayment under this subsection in respect of such Net Cash Proceeds to the extent 
such Net Cash Proceeds are actually 
 reinvested in such similar assets with such 180-day period. 
Promptly after the end of such 180-day period, the Borrower shall 
 notify the Administrative Agent whether the Borrower or such Subsidiary 
has reinvested such Net Cash Proceeds in such 
 similar assets, and, to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have not been so reinvested, 
the Borrower shall promptly prepay the 
 Obligations in the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so reinvested. 
The amount of each such prepayment shall be applied, 
 subject to Section 2.8(b)(v) below, 
first to the outstanding Incremental Term 
Loans, if any, on a ratable basis based 
on the 
 outstanding principal amounts thereof, and then to the Revolving Facility, 
but without a reduction of the Revolving Credit 
 Commitments. 
If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders so request, all proceeds of 
such Disposition or Event of 
 Loss shall be deposited with the Administrative Agent (or its agent) and held by it in 
the Collateral Account. 
So long as no 
 Default exists, the Administrative Agent is authorized to disburse amounts 
representing such proceeds from the Collateral 
 Account to or at the Borrower s direction for application to or 
reimbursement for the costs of replacing, rebuilding or restoring 
 such Property. 
 
(iii) 
If after the Closing Date the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall issue new equity securities (whether 
common or 
 preferred stock or otherwise), other than Excluded Equity Issuances, the Borrower 
shall promptly notify the Administrative 
 Agent of the estimated Net Cash Proceeds of such issuance to be received by or for the 
account of the Borrower or such 
 Subsidiary in respect thereof. 
Promptly upon receipt by the Borrower or such Subsidiary of Net Cash Proceeds 
of such 
 issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Obligations in an aggregate amount 
equal to 100 of the amount of such Net Cash 
 Proceeds. 
The amount of each such prepayment shall be applied, subject to Section 2.8(b)(v) 
below, first to the outstanding 
 Incremental Term 
Loans, if any, on a ratable basis based 
on the outstanding principal amounts thereof, and then to the 
 Revolving Facility, but 
without a reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments. 
The Borrower acknowledges that its 
 performance hereunder shall not limit the rights and remedies of the Lenders 
for any breach of Section 8.11 (Maintenance of 
 Subsidiaries) or Section 9.1(i) (Change of Control) or any other terms 
of the Loan Documents. 

(iv) 
If after the Closing Date the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall issue any Indebtedness, 
other than Indebtedness 
 permitted by Section 8.7, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative 
Agent of the estimated Net Cash Proceeds of 
 such issuance to be received by or for the account of the Borrower or such Subsidiary 
in respect thereof. 
Promptly upon receipt 
 by the Borrower or such Subsidiary of Net Cash Proceeds of such issuance, the Borrower 
shall prepay the Obligations in an 
 aggregate amount equal to 100 of the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds. 
The amount of each such prepayment shall be 
 applied, subject to Section 2.8(b)(v) below, 
first to the outstanding Incremental Term 
Loans, if any, on a ratable basis based 
on 
 the outstanding principal amounts thereof, and then to the Revolving Facility, 
but without a reduction of the Revolving Credit 
 Commitments. 
The Borrower acknowledges that its performance hereunder shall not 
limit the rights and remedies of the 
 Lenders for any breach of Section 8.7 or any other terms of the Loan Documents. 
 
(v) 
Unless the Borrower otherwise directs, prepayments of Loans under 
this Section 2.8(b) shall be applied first to 
 Borrowings of Base Rate Loans until payment in full thereof with any balance 
applied to Borrowings of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 Loans in the order in which their Interest Periods expire. 
Each prepayment of Loans under this Section 2.8(b) shall be made by 
 the payment of the principal amount to be prepaid and, in the case of any Incremental 
Term Loans, 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans or 
 Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment together 
with any amounts due the Lenders under Section 
 4.5. 
Each prefunding of L/C Obligations shall be made in accordance with Section 9.4. 

(c) 
Any amount of Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans paid or prepaid before 
the Revolving Credit Termination 
 Date may, subject to 
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be borrowed, repaid and borrowed again. 
No amount of the 
 Incremental Term 
Loans, if any, paid or prepaid may 
be reborrowed, and, in the case of any partial prepayment, such 
 prepayment shall be applied to the remaining payments on all Incremental 
Term Loans in inverse order of maturity. 

Section 2.9. 
Default Rate. 

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while any Event of Default 
 exists or after acceleration, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry 
of judgment thereon to the extent 
 permitted by law) on the principal amount of all Loans and Reimbursement 
Obligations, letter of credit fees and other amounts 
 at a rate per annum equal to: 
 
(a) 
for any Base Rate Loan or any Swingline Loan bearing interest based on the Base Rate, the 
sum of 
 2.0 
 plus 
 the Applicable Margin 
 plus 
 the Base Rate from time to time in effect; 

(b) 
for any 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loan or any Swingline Loan bearing interest at the Administrative Agent s 
 Quoted Rate, the sum of 2.0 
 plus 
 the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such Event of Default 
until the 
 end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, 
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2.0 
 plus 
 the 
 Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans 
 plus 
 the Base Rate from time to time in effect; 
 
(c) 
for any Reimbursement Obligation, the sum of 2.0 
 plus 
 the amounts due under Section 2.3 with 
 respect to such Reimbursement Obligation; 

(d) 
for any Letter of Credit, the sum of 2.0 
 plus 
 the L/C Participation Fee due under Section 3.1(b) 
 with respect to such Letter of Credit; and 
 
(e) 
for any other amount owing hereunder not covered by clauses (a) through (d) 
above, the sum of 2 
 plus
 
the Applicable Margin 
 plus
 
the Base Rate from time to time in effect; 
 provided, however, 
 that in the absence of acceleration pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3, any adjustments pursuant 
to this Section 
 shall be made at the election of the Administrative Agent, acting at the request or with 
the consent of the Required Lenders, 
 with written notice to the Borrower (which election may be retroactively effective 
to the date of such Event of Default). 
While 
 any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, interest shall be paid on demand 
of the Administrative Agent at the request or 
 with the consent of the Required Lenders. 

 Section 2.10. 
Evidence of Indebtedness.
 
(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an 
 account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such 
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such 
 Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest 
payable and paid to such Lender from time to time 
 hereunder. 
 
(b) 
The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record 
(i) the amount of each Loan made 
 hereunder, the type thereof and the Interest Period 
with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and 
 payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder 
and (iii) the amount of any sum received by 
 the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender s 
share thereof. 
 
(c) 
The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsections 
(a) and (b) above shall be 
 prima facie
 evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; 
 provided, however, 
 that the failure of the 
 Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any 
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation 
 of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. 
 
(d) 
Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note or 
notes in the forms of Exhibit D-1 
 (in the case of its Revolving Loans and referred to herein as a 
 Revolving Note), or D-2 (in the case of its Swingline Loans 
 and referred to herein as a 
 Swing Note), as applicable (the Revolving Notes and Swing Note being hereinafter 
referred to 
 collectively as the 
 Notes 
 
and individually as a 
 Note). 
In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to 
 such Lender a Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns in the amount 
of the relevant Commitment, or Swingline 
 Sublimit, as applicable. 
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note or Notes 
and interest thereon shall at all times (including 
 after any assignment pursuant to Section 13.2) be represented by one or more 
Notes payable to the order of the payee named 
 therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 13.2, except to the extent that any such 
Lender or assignee subsequently returns any 
 such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced 
as described in subsections (a) and (b) above. 

Section 2.11. 
Commitment Terminations. 
 
(a) 
 Optional Revolving Credit Terminations. 

 The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time, 
 upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent 
(or such shorter period of time agreed to by the 
 Administrative Agent), to terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments without 
premium or penalty and in whole or in part, 
 any partial termination to be (i) in an amount not less than 5,000,000 
or any whole multiple thereof and (ii) allocated ratably 
 among the Lenders in proportion to their respective Revolver Percentages, 
provided that the Revolving Credit Commitments 
 may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum of the aggregate principal amount 
of Swingline Loans, Revolving Loans, 
 and L/C Obligations then outstanding. 
Any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments below the L/C Sublimit or 
the 
 Swingline Sublimit then in effect shall reduce the L/C Sublimit and 
Swingline Sublimit, as applicable, by a like amount. 
The 
 Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of any such termination 
of the Revolving Credit Commitments. 
 
(b) 
Any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section 
may not be reinstated. 
 Section 2.12. 
Replacement of Lenders
 . 
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.4, or if the Borrower is 
 required to pay any Indemnified Taxes 
or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account 
of 
 any Lender pursuant to Section 4.1 and, in each case, such Lender has declined 
or is unable to designate a different lending 
 office in accordance with Section 4.7, or if any Lender is a Defaulting 
Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, 
then the Borrower 
 may, at its sole expense 
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require 
such Lender to assign and 
 delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions 
contained in, and consents required by, 
Section 
 13.2), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant 
to Section 4.1 or Section 4.4) and obligations 
 under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that 
shall assume such obligations (which 
 assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender 
accepts such assignment); 
 provided 
 that: 
 
(i) 
the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if 
any) specified in 
 Section 13.2;
 
(ii) 
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding 
principal of its 
 Loans and funded participations in L/C Obligations, accrued interest thereon, 
accrued fees and all other amounts 
 payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any 
amounts under Section
 4.5 as if the Loans 
 owing to it were prepaid rather than assigned) from the assignee (to the 
extent of such outstanding principal and 
 accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
 
(iii) 
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation 
under Section 4.4 or 
 payments required to be made pursuant to Section 4.1, such assignment will result in 
a reduction in such compensation 
 or payments thereafter; 
 
(iv) 
such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and 
 
(v) 
in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting 
Lender, the 
 applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, 
waiver or consent. 
 A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior 
thereto, as a result of a waiver by 
 such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require 
such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 Section 2.13. 
Defaulting Lenders. 
 
(a) 
 Defaulting Lender Adjustments.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if 
any 
 Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, 
then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, 
to the extent 
 permitted by applicable law: 
 
(i) 
 Waivers and 
Amendments
 . 
Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any 
 amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted 
as set forth in the definition of 
 Required Lenders. 

(ii) 
 Defaulting Lender Waterfall
 . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by 
 the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender 
(whether voluntary or mandatory, 
at maturity, 
 pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from 
a Defaulting Lender pursuant to 
 Section 13.7 hereto shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined 
by the Administrative Agent as 
 follows: 
 first
 , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender 
to the Administrative Agent hereunder; 
 second
 , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to 
any L/C Issuer or the 
 Swingline Lender hereunder; 
 third
 , to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure with respect 
to such 
 Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.14; 
 fourth
 , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), 
 to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to 
fund its portion thereof as required 
 by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; 
 fifth
 , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and 
 the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and 
released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s 
 potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement 
and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C 
 Issuer s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting 
Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued 
 under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.14; 
 sixth
 , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the 
 L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent 
jurisdiction obtained by any 
 Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender 
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s 
 breach of its obligations under this Agreement; 
 seventh
 , so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts 
 owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction 
obtained by the Borrower 
 against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s 
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; 
 and 
 eighth
 , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction; 
 provided
 
that if (x) 
 such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Obligations 
in respect of which such 
 Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were 
made or the related Letters of 
 Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 were 
satisfied or waived, such payment shall 
 be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting 
Lenders on a pro rata basis 
 prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, 
such Defaulting Lender until such 
 time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and 
Swingline Loans are held by the 
 Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Percentages of the relevant Commitments 
without giving effect to Section 
 2.13(a)(iv) below. 
Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are 
 applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant 
to this Section 
 2.13(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting 
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents 
 hereto. 
 
(iii) 
 Certain Fees
 . 

(A) 
No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee for any period 
during 
 which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required 
to pay any such fee that 
 otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting 
Lender). 

(B) 
Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Participation Fees for 
any period 
 during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable 
to its Percentage of the stated 
 amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant 
to Section 2.14. 
 
(C) 
With respect to any L/C Participation Fee not 
required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender 
 pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting 
Lender that portion of any 
 such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such 
Defaulting Lender s participation 
 in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such 
Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to 
 clause (iv) below, (y) pay 
to each L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender, as applicable, 
the amount of any such fee 
 otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such 
L/C Issuer s or Swingline 
 Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, 
and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount 
 of any such fee.

(iv) 
 Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting 
Exposure
 . 
All or any part of such Defaulting 
 Lender s participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline 
Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting 
 Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages of the relevant 
Commitments (calculated without regard to 
 such Defaulting Lender s Commitments) but only to 
the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 are 
 satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise 
notified the Administrative 
 Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted 
that such conditions are satisfied 
 at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving 
Loans and interests in L/C Obligations 
 and Swingline Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting 
Lender s Revolving Credit 
 Commitment. 
Subject to Section 13.21, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release 
of any claim of 
 any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender 
having become a Defaulting Lender, 
 including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting 
Lender s increased exposure 
 following such reallocation. 
 
(v) 
 Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swingline Loans
 . 
If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above 
 cannot, or can only partially, 
be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy 
available to 
 them hereunder or under law, 
(x) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Lender s 
Fronting 
 Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s Fronting 
Exposure in accordance with the procedures set 
 forth in Section 2.14. 
 
(b) 
 Defaulting Lender Cure
 . 
If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
Swingline Lender and each L/C Issuer 
 agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, 
the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, 
 whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice 
and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include 
 arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the 
extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of 
 outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative 
Agent may determine to be necessary to 
 cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit 
and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the 
 Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages of the relevant 
Commitments (without giving effect to Section 
 2.13(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; 
 provided
 
that no adjustments will be made 
 retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of 
the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting 
 Lender; and 
 provided
 , 
 further
 , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected 
parties, no change hereunder 
 from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any 
party hereunder arising from that 
 Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
 
(c) 
 New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit
 . 
So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the 
Swingline Lender 
 shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no 
Fronting Exposure after giving effect 
 to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew 
or increase any Letter of Credit unless it 
 is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect 
thereto.
 Section 2.14. 
Cash Collateral for Fronting Exposure. 

 At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, 
within 
 one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or 
any L/C Issuer (with a copy to the 
 Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers 
Fronting Exposure with respect to such 
 Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.13(a)(iv) 
and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting 
 Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.
 
(a) 
 Grant of Security Interest
 . 
The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any 
Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting 
 Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, 
for the benefit of the L/C Issuers, and agree to maintain, a first priority 
 security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for such Defaulting 
Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect 
 of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below. 
If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash 
 Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative 
Agent and the L/C Issuers as herein 
 provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum 
Collateral Amount, the Borrower shall, 
 promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to 
the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in 
 an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect 
to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting 
 Lender). 
 
(b) 
 Application
 . 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, 
Cash Collateral provided 
 under this Section 2.14 or Section 2.13 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied 
to the satisfaction of the Defaulting 
 Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations 
(including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a 
 Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued 
on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other 
 application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 

(c) 
 Termination 
of Requirement
 . 
Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any L/C 
 Issuer s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required 
to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.14(c) following 
 (A) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including 
by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the 
 applicable Lender), or (B) the determination by the Administrative 
Agent and each L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash 
 Collateral; 
 provided
 
that, subject to Section 2.14, the Person providing Cash Collateral and each L/C Issuer may 
agree that Cash 
 Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure 
or other obligations; and 
 provided further 
 that to the 
 extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower or any 
other Loan Party, such Cash Collateral shall remain 
 subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents. 
 Section 2.15. 
Increase in Revolving Credit 
Commitments; Making of Incremental Term 
Loans. 

 The Borrower may, 
 on any Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the 
 L/C Issuer, and the Swingline Lender, 
increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments and/or borrow one 
 or more term loans (collectively, 
the 
 Incremental Term 
Loans), in each case, by delivering an Increase Request substantially 
 in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative 
Agent) to the Administrative 
 Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the desired effective date 
of such increase (the 
 Increase) identifying an 
 additional Lender, which qualifies as an Eligible 
Assignee (or additional Revolving Credit Commitments or a commitment to 
 make Incremental Term 
Loans for an existing Lender) and the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment 
or Incremental 
 Term Loan (or, 
for an existing Lender, the amount of additional Revolving 
Credit Commitments or the amount of a 
 commitment to make Incremental Term 
Loans); 
 provided, however
 , that:
 
(a) 
the aggregate amount of all such Increases shall not exceed 200,000,000 
and any such Increase 
 shall be in an amount not less than 10,000,000 (or such lesser amount then agreed 
to by the Administrative Agent); 
 
(b) 
no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of the request or 
the effective date of 
 the Increase and after giving pro forma effect to the use of proceeds thereof; 
and 
 
(c) 
each of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6 and in the other Loan 
Documents 
 shall be and remain true and correct in all material respects on the effective 
date of such Increase (where not already 
 qualified by materiality, 
otherwise in all respects), except to the extent the same expressly relate to an earlier date, in 
 which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (where not already 
qualified by materiality, otherwise 
 in all respects)
 as of such earlier date. 
 The effective date (the 
 Increase Date) of the Increase shall be agreed upon by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and 
 the Lender(s) providing such Increase. 
Upon the Increase Date, Schedule 2.1/2.2 shall be deemed amended 
to reflect the 
 Increase. 
With respect to an Increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments 
as described above, on the Increase Date, the new 
 Revolving Lender(s) (or, if applicable, existing 
Lender(s)) shall advance Revolving Loans, as applicable, in an amount 
 sufficient such that after giving effect to 
such advance(s) or loan(s) and the prepayment of Revolving Loans by any Lender(s) 
 whose commitment is not increased, each Lender shall have outstanding 
its Revolver Percentage of Revolving Loans. 
It shall 
 be a condition to such effectiveness that (A) if any 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans are outstanding on the date of such effectiveness, 
 such 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans shall be deemed to be prepaid on such date and the Borrower shall pay any 
amounts owing to the 
 Lenders pursuant to Section 4.5 and (B) the Borrower shall not have terminated 
any portion of the Revolving Credit 
 Commitments pursuant to Section 2.11. 
The Borrower agrees to pay the expenses of the Administrative Agent (including 
 reasonable attorney s fees) 
relating to any Increase. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, 
no Lender shall have any 
 obligation to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment or to make any 
Incremental Term Loan and 
no Lender s Revolving 
 Credit Commitment shall be increased without its consent thereto, and 
each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and 
 without cause, decline to provide any Increase. 
 Each Revolving Credit Increase shall be on the same terms (including pricing 
and maturity, but excluding customary 
 arrangement, commitment, structuring and underwriting fees, and amendment 
fees not generally shared with other Lenders with 
 respect to such Revolving Credit Increase) as the Revolving Credit Commitments outstanding 
prior to the Increase Date. 
Each 
 Incremental Term 
Loan shall be on terms and conditions specified in an Incremental Amendment. 

Commitments in respect of Incremental Term 
Loans and increases in the Revolving Credit Commitment shall become 
 commitments (or in the case of an increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment to 
be provided by an existing Lender, an 
 increase in such Lender s applicable Revolving Credit 
Commitment) under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an 
 Incremental Amendment) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed 
by the Borrowers, each 
 existing Lender agreeing to provide such Increase, if any, 
each additional Lender, if any, 
and the Administrative Agent. 
The 
 Incremental Amendment may, 
without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments 
to this Agreement and the 
 other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion 
of the Administrative Agent and the 
 Borrowers, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.15. 
 
Section 2.16. 
Extension Option. 

 (a) The Borrower may, by written 
notice to the Administrative Agent from time to 
 time, request an extension (each, an 
 Extension) of the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date and/or, if applicable, any maturity 
 date applicable to any Incremental Term 
Loan to the extended maturity date specified in such request. 
Such notice shall set 
 forth (i) the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Incremental 
Term Loans to be 
extended (which shall be in 
 minimum increments of 5,000,000 and a minimum of 10,000,000) and (ii) 
the date on which such Extension is requested to 
 become effective (which date shall not be less than ten (10) Business Days nor 
more than sixty (60) days after after the date of 
 such requested Extension (or such longer or shorter periods as the Administrative 
Agent shall agree). 
Each Lender shall be 
 offered (an 
 Extension Offer) an opportunity to participate in such Extension on a pro rata basis and on the same 
terms and 
 conditions as each other Lender pursuant to procedures established by, 
or reasonably acceptable to, the Administrative Agent. 

 Any Lender approached to participate in such Extension may elect or decline, 
in its sole discretion, to participate in such 
 Extension (it being understood that if a Lender shall fail to respond to any request for 
participation in an Extension within five 
 (5) Business Days of receipt of the Extension Offer, 
such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate in such 
 Extension). 
If the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental 
Term Loans, (calculated 
on 
 the face amount thereof), as applicable, in respect of which Lenders shall have 
accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall 
 exceed 
the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment or Incremental 
Term Loan, as 
 applicable, requested to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to the Extension 
Offer, then the Revolving Credit 
Commitments 
 or Incremental Term 
Loans, as applicable of the Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum 
amount based on the 
 respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of 
record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted 
 such Extension Offer. 
 
(b) 
It shall be a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any Extension 
that: 
(i) no Default shall have occurred 
 and be continuing immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect 
to such Extension, (ii) the representations and 
 warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in 
Section 6 or any other Loan Document, or which are 
 contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith 
or therewith, shall be true and correct in all 
 material respects (and in all respects if any such representation or warranty 
is already qualified by materiality or reference to 
 Material Adverse Effect) on and as of the date of such Extension, 
except to the extent that such representations and warranties 
 specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case, 
they shall be true and correct in all material respects (and in all respects if 
 any such representation or warranty is already qualified by materiality 
or reference to Material Adverse Effect) as of such 
 earlier date, (iii) the L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender shall have consented to 
any Extension of the Revolving Credit 
 Commitments if such Extension provides for the issuance of Letters of Credit 
or the making of Swingline Loans at any time 
 during the extended period, and (iv) the terms of such Extension shall comply 
with Section 2.16(c). 
 
(c) 
The terms of each Extension shall be determined by the Borrower and 
the applicable extending Lenders and be 
 set forth in an Additional Credit Extension Amendment, provided, that (i) 
the final maturity date of any Extended Revolving 
 Credit Commitment or Extended Incremental Term 
Loan shall be no earlier than the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date or the 
 maturity date applicable to the existing Incremental Term 
Loans, (ii)(A) there shall be no scheduled amortization of the 
 Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and (B) the scheduled amortization 
of the Extended Incremental Term 
Loans shall be 
 as agreed among the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Extended 
Incremental Term Loans, (iii)(A) 
the Extended 
 Revolving Loans and the Extended Incremental Term 
Loans will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans 
 and the Incremental Term 
Loans being extended, and (B) the borrower and the guarantors of the Extended Revolving 
Credit 
 Commitments or the Extended Incremental Term 
Loans, as applicable, shall be the Borrower and the Guarantors, (iv) the 
 interest rate margins and fees applicable to any Extended Revolving 
Credit Commitments (and the Extended Revolving Loans 
 thereunder) and Extended Incremental Loans shall be determined by the 
Borrower and the applicable extending Lenders, and 
 (v) to the extent the terms of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended 
Incremental Term Loans are 
 inconsistent with the terms set forth herein (except as set forth in clauses (i) 
through (iv) above), such terms shall be reasonably 
 satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 

(d) 
In connection with any Extension, the Borrower, 
the Administrative Agent and each applicable extending 
 Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Additional 
Credit Extension Amendment and such other 
 documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence 
the Extension. 
The Administrative Agent shall 
 promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of 
each Extension. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, 
any 
 Additional Credit Extension Amendment may, 
without the consent of any other Lender, effect such 
amendment to this 
 Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate 
(but only to such extent), in the reasonable 
 opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, 
to implement the terms of any such Extension Offer, 
including any 
 amendments necessary to establish Extended Revolving Credit Commitments 
or Extended Incremental Term 
Loans as a new 
 tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term 
Loan, as applicable, and such other technical amendments as 
 may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative 
Agent and the Borrower in connection with the 
 establishment of such new tranche (including to preserve the pro rata treatment 
of the extended and non-extended tranches and 
 to provide for the reallocation of any L/C Obligations or obligations under 
Swingline Loans upon the expiration or termination 
 of the commitments under any tranche), in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.16. 
 
(e) 
This Section 2.16 shall supersede any provisions of Section 13.3 
to the contrary.

(a) 
 Revolving Credit Commitment Fee
 . 
The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account 
 of the Lenders in accordance with their Revolver Percentages a commitment fee 
at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable 
 Margin (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number 
of days elapsed) times the daily amount by which 
 the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments exceeds the principal 
amount of Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations then 
 outstanding. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the principal amount of Swingline Loans shall not be counted 
towards or considered 
 usage of the Revolving Credit Commitments for purposes of this Section. 
Such commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in 
 arrears on the last day of each March, June, September, 
and December in each year (commencing on the first such date 
 occurring after the Closing Date) and on the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, unless the Revolving Credit Commitments are 
 terminated in whole on an earlier date, in which event the commitment fee 
for the period to the date of such termination in 
 whole shall be paid on the date of such termination. 
 
(b) 
 Letter of Credit Fees.
 
On the date of issuance or extension, or increase in the amount, of any Letter of Credit 
 pursuant to Section 1.3, the Borrower shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account

 amount of (or of the increase in the face amount of) such Letter of Credit. 
Quarterly in arrears, on the last day of each March, 
 June, September, and December, 
commencing on the first such date occurring after the Closing Date, the Borrower 
shall pay to 
 the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders in accordance 
with their Revolver Percentages, a letter of credit 
 fee (the 
 L/C Participation Fee) at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin (computed 
on the basis of a year of 360 
 days and the actual number of days elapsed) in effect during each 
day of such quarter applied to the daily average face amount 
 of Letters of Credit outstanding during such quarter. 
In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account 
 the L/C Issuer s standard issuance, drawing, negotiation, 
amendment, assignment, and other administrative fees for each Letter 
 of Credit as established by the L/C Issuer from time to time. 

(c) 
 Administrative Agent Fees
 . 
The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own use and benefit, 
 the fees agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in 
a letter dated as of the date hereof, or as otherwise 
 agreed to in writing between them.

Section 4.1. 
Taxes. 
 
(a) 
 Certain Defined Terms. 

 For purposes of this Section, the term Lender includes any L/C Issuer and 
the term 
 applicable law includes FATCA. 

(b) 
 Payments Free of Taxes. 

 Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under 
any 
 Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, 
except as required by applicable law. 
If any 
 applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable 
Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or 
 withholding of any Tax 
from any such payment by a Withholding 
Agent, then the applicable Withholding 
Agent shall be 
 entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount 
deducted or withheld to the relevant 
 Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax 
is an Indemnified Tax, then the 
sum payable by the 
 applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or 
withholding has been made (including 
 such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable 
under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives 
 an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or 
withholding been made. 
 
(c) 
 Payment of Other Taxes 
by the Loan Parties. 

 The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental 
 Authority in accordance with applicable law, 
or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment 
 of, any Other Taxes. 
 
(d) 
 Indemnification by the Loan Parties. 

 The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, 
 within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, 
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes 
(including Indemnified Taxes 
 imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable 
or paid by such Recipient or required to 
 be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable 
expenses arising therefrom or with respect 
 thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes 
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental 
 Authority. 
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by 
a Lender (with a copy to the 
 Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf 
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent 
 manifest error. 
 
(e) 
 Indemnification by the Lenders. 

 Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 
ten 
 (10) days after demand therefor, for 
(i) any Indemnified Taxes or 
Other Taxes attributable to such 
Lender (but only to the 
 extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative 
Agent for such Indemnified Taxes 
or Other Taxes 
 and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes 
attributable to such Lender s failure to comply 
 with the provisions of Section 13.2(d) relating to the maintenance of 
a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes 
 attributable to such Lender, in each case, that 
are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan 
 Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect 
thereto, whether or not such Taxes 
were correctly or 
 legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. 
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability 
 delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive 
absent manifest error. 
Each Lender hereby authorizes 
 the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any 
time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document 
 or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other 
source against any amount due to the 
 Administrative Agent under this subsection (e). 
 
(f) 
 Evidence of Payments. 
 As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes 
by any Loan Party to a Governmental 
 Authority pursuant to this Section, such Loan Party shall deliver to 
the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of 
 a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, 
a copy of the return reporting such payment or 
 other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative 
Agent. 
 
(g) 
 Status of Lenders. 

 (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax 
with 
 respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower 
and the Administrative Agent, at the time or 
 times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, 
such properly completed and executed documentation 
 reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such 
payments to be made without 
 withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. 
In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested 
by the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed 
by applicable law or reasonably requested by the 
 Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative 
Agent to determine whether or not 
 such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting 
requirements. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
 in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission 
of such documentation (other than such 
 documentation set forth in Section 4.1(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) 
shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable 
 judgment such completion, execution or submission would 
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense 
 or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 

(ii) 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 

(A) 
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative 
Agent on or 
 prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement 
(and from time to time thereafter upon 
 the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed 
originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying 
 that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
 
(B) 
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower 
and the 
 Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by 
the recipient) on or prior to the date on which 
 such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and 
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
 request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following 
is applicable: 
 
(i) 
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty 
to which the 
 United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed 
originals 
 of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing 
an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax 
 pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable 
payments 
 under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN 
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal 
 withholding Tax 
pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
 
(ii) 
executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
 
(iii)

interest 
 under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 
H-1 to the effect that 
 such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) 
of the Code, a 10 percent 
 shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) 
of the Code, or a controlled 
 foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a 
 U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate) 
 and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; 
or 
 
(iv) 
to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, 
executed originals of IRS Form 
 W-8IMY, 
accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, 
IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate 
 substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, 
and/or other certification documents 
 from each beneficial owner, as applicable; 
 provided 
 that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or 
 more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio 
interest exemption, such 
 Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax 
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on 
 behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
 
(C) 
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower 
and the 
 Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) 
on or prior to the date on which 
 such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and 
from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
 request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals 
of any other form prescribed by applicable 
 law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding 
Tax, duly completed, together 
 with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by 
applicable law to permit the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required 
to be made; and 
 
(D) 
if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. 
federal 
 withholding Tax 
imposed by FATCA 
if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements 
 of FATCA 
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of 
the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall 
 deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times 
prescribed by law and at such time or times 
 reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation 
prescribed by applicable law 
 (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and 
such additional documentation reasonably 
 requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary 
for the Borrower and the Administrative 
 Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA 
and to determine that such Lender has complied with such 
 Lender s obligations under FATCA 
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. 
Solely for 
 purposes of this clause (D), 
 FATCA 
 shall include any amendments made to FATCA 
after the date of this 
 Agreement. 
 Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered 
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate 
 in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify 
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in 
 writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(h) 
 Treatment 
of Certain Refunds. 

 If any party receives a refund of any Taxes 
as to which it has been indemnified 
 pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts 
pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the 
 indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of 
indemnity payments made under this Section with 
 respect to the Taxes 
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) 
of such indemnified party 
 and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental 
Authority with respect to such refund). 
Such 
 indemnifying party, upon 
the request of such indemnified party, 
shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over 
 pursuant to this subsection (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other 
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in 
 the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental 
Authority. 
Notwithstanding 
 anything to the contrary in this subsection (h), in no event will the indemnified party 
be required to pay any amount to an 
 indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (h) the payment of which would place 
the indemnified party in a less favorable 
 net after-Tax 
position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax 
subject to indemnification had not been 
 deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or 
additional amounts giving rise to such refund 
 had never been paid. 
This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to 
make available its Tax returns 
 (or any other information relating to its Taxes 
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 
(i) 
 Survival. 

 Each party s obligations under this Section
 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the 
 Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, 
or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination 
of the Commitments and 
 the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations 
under any Loan Document. 
 Section 4.2. 
Change of Law
 . 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan 
 Document, if at any time any Change in Law makes it unlawful for any Lender 
to make or continue to maintain any 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, 
such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to 
 the Borrower and such Lender s obligations to make or maintain 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans under this Agreement shall be 
 suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans. 
The Borrower shall 
 prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans, together with all interest 
 accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender 
under this Agreement; 
 provided, however,
 
subject 
 to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then elect 
to borrow the principal amount of the affected 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 
Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from 
such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be 
 made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender
 
and which shall be determined without reference to clause (c) 
 of the definition of Base Rate . Upon any such repayment, the Borrower 
shall also pay any additional amounts required 
 pursuant to Section 4.5
 . 
 Section 4.3.

 received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement 
from Lenders comprising the Required 
 Lenders
 .

(ii) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document 
and subject to the 
 proviso below in this paragraph, if a Term 
SOFR Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred 
 prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the

Any 
 determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent 
or, if applicable, any Lender (or 
 group of Lenders) 
 pursuant to this Section 4.3(c)
 , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate 
or 
 adjustment or of the occurrence or non
 -
 occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain 
 from taking any action or any selection, will be 
 made in good faith
 
in its or their reasonable discretion 
 giving due 
 consideration to any selection or recommendation by the Relevant 
Governmental Body and to any prevailing market 
 practices for U.S. Dollar-denominated syndicated

 error without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan 
Document, except, in each case, as 
 expressly required pursuant to this Section
 
4.3(c). 
The parties hereto acknowledge that, on March 5, 2021, the ICE
 Benchmark Administration 
 (the 
 IBA), the administrator of the London interbank offered rate LIBOR Rate), 
 stated that as a result of its not having access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR Rate settings on 
a 
 representative basis beyond the intended cessation dates set forth in such statement, 
it would have to cease publication 
 of all 35 LIBOR Rate settings immediately after such dates. 
The IBA did not identify any successor administrator in 
 its announcement. 
The IBA also noted that the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the 
 FCA), the regulatory 
 supervisor for the IBA, could, at a later date, use proposed new powers to 
require the IBA to publish LIBOR Rate 
 settings on a synthetic basis. 
The FCA also issued a separate announcement confirming that the IBA had notified 
the 
 FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR Rate settings. While the FCA stated that, subject 
to the establishment 
 of the new proposed powers, it would consult on the issue of requiring the 
IBA to produce certain LIBOR Rate tenors 
 on a synthetic basis, it confirmed that all 35 LIBOR Rate settings will either cease to 
be provided by any administrator 
 or will no longer be representative as of the dates set forth in such statement.
 
(v) 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, 
at any time 
 (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark 
Replacement), A) if the then-current Benchmark is 
 a term rate (including Term 
SOFR or LIBOR) and either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a 
 screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to 
time as selected by 
 the Administrative Agent 
 in good faith and in its reasonable discretion giving due consideration to any prevailing 
market practice for U.S. 
 Dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities or 
(2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such 
 Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information 
announcing that any tenor for such 
 Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative 
Agent may modify the definition of Interest 
 Period 
 
for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable
 
or non-representative tenor and 
 (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or 
 information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) 
or 2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an 
 announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including 
a Benchmark Replacement), 
 then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period 
 
for all Benchmark settings at or after 
 such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
 
(vi) 
Upon the Borrower s
 
(a) 
 the Administrative Agent 
 determines in good faith (which determination
 
shall be conclusive and 
 binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot 
be determined pursuant to the definition thereof,

then the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and 
each Lender. 
Upon notice thereof
 
by the 
 Administrative Agent 
 to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make 
or continue SOFR Loans shall be suspended (to 
 the extent of the affected SOFR Loans and, in the case of a SOFR Loan, the 
affected Interest Periods) until
 
the Administrative 
 Agent
 
revokes such notice. Upon
 
receipt of 
 such 
 notice
 
of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period
 ,
 
(i)
 
the 
 Borrower may revoke any 
 pending 
 request for a 
 Borrowing
 borrowing
 
of, conversion to or continuation of 
 Eurodollar
 SOFR
 Loans 
 to 
 be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period 
and
 the extent of the affected SOFR 
 Loans and, in the case of a SOFR Loan, the affected Interest Periods) 
or
 , failing that, the 
 Borrowers
 Borrower
 
will be deemed to 
 have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to 
Base Rate Loans
 . During any Benchmark 
 Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark 
is not an Available Tenor, 
the component of 
 Base Rate based upon the then-
 current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not 
be used in any 
 determination of Base Rate.
 
in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans 
will be deemed to 
 have been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately or, 
in the case of a SOFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest 
 Period. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay any additional 
amounts required pursuant to Section 4.5.

(3) 
the sum of: 
(a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the 
 Administrative Agent and the Borrower 
 as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark for the 
 applicable Corresponding Tenor 
giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of 
 a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining 
such a rate by the Relevant

shall revert to and shall be 
 deemed to be the sum of (a) Term 
SOFR and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment, as

selected or recommended 
 by the Relevant Governmental Body for the replacement of such 
Benchmark with the applicable 
 Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for the applicable Corresponding 
Tenor;

 recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining 
such spread 
 adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted 
Benchmark 
 Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark 
Replacement Date 
 and/or (ii) any evolving or then-

the timing of borrowing 
 requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices, the length of 
lookback periods, the 
 applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative 
or operational matters) that 
 the Administrative Agent 
 reasonably 
 decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and 
 implementation of 
 such Benchmark Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by 
the 
 Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market 
practice (or, if the 
 Administrative Agent in good faith
 
decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is 
 not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent determines

 decides is reasonably necessary in 
 connection with the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).

 of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices 
or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate 
 in a written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 

 If any Lender requests compensation under Section 4.4, or 
 requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes 
or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for 
 the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 4.1, then such Lender shall 
(at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts 
 to designate a different lending office for funding 
or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations 
 hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, 
if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation 
or assignment (i) 
 would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.4, as the case may be, 
in the future, and (ii) would not 
 subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise 
be disadvantageous to such Lender.

by any Lender in connection with any such 
 designation or assignment.

All payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and the 
 Reimbursement Obligations, and all other Obligations payable by the Borrower 
under this Agreement and the other Loan 
 Documents, shall be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent by no 
later than 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the due 
 date thereof at the office of the Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois 
(or such other location as the Administrative Agent 
 may designate to the Borrower), for the benefit of the Lender(s) or L/C Issuer 
entitled thereto. 
Any payments received after 
 such time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on 
the next Business Day. 
All such payments 
 shall be made in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds at the place of payment, 
in each case without set-off or 
 counterclaim. 
The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed 
like funds relating to the payment of 
 principal or interest on Loans and on Reimbursement Obligations in which 
the Lenders have purchased Participating Interests 
 ratably to the Lenders and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount 
payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each 
 case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice 
 from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative 
Agent for the account of the Lenders or 
 the L/C Issuers hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative 
Agent may assume that the 
 Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, 
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to 
 the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. 
With respect to any payment that the Administrative 
Agent 
 makes to any Lender, L/C Issuer or other 
secured party hereunder as to which Administrative Agent determines (in its sole and 
 absolute discretion) that any of the following applies (such payment referred 
to as the 
 Rescindable Amount): (1) the 
 Borrowers have not in fact made the corresponding payment to the Administrative 
Agent; (2) the Administrative Agent has 
 made a payment in excess of the amount(s) received by it from the Borrowers either individually 
or in the aggregate (whether 
 or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise 
erroneously made such payment; then each of 
 the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the other Affiliates of the Lenders that 
are secured parties hereunder severally agrees to repay to 
 the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount 
so distributed to such Person, in immediately available 
 funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such 
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of 
 payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and 
a rate determined by the Administrative 
 Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 Section 5.2. 
Non-Business Days. 

 Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment hereunder becomes 
 due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, 
the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding 
 Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable. 
In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a 
 day which is not a Business Day, 
interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate 
per 
 annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on 
the next scheduled date for the payment of interest. 

Section 5.3. 
Payments Set Aside
 . 
To the extent that any payment by or 
on behalf of the Borrower or any other 
 Loan Party is made to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender, 
or the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or 
 any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds 
of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently 
 invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or 
required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by 
 the Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be 
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, 
 in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then 
(a) to the extent of such recovery, 
the 
 obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived 
and continued in full force and effect as if such 
 payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and 
(b) each Lender and each L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to 
 the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without 
duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by 
 the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to 
the date such payment is made at a rate per 
 annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by 
the Administrative Agent in accordance with 
 banking industry rules on interbank compensation for each such day. 
 
Section 5.4. 
Account Debit

The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, upon 
at least 
 two (2) business days prior notice to Borrower, 
to charge any of the Borrower s deposit accounts maintained 
with the 
 Administrative Agent for the amounts from time to time necessary to pay any then 
due Obligations; 
 provided
 
that
 the Borrower

and any investments from time to time held 
 therein, and any substitutions for such account, any certificate of deposit 
or other instrument evidencing any of the foregoing 
 and all proceeds of and earnings on any of the foregoing being collectively

of any payment under any Letter of 
 Credit then or thereafter made by the L/C Issuer, 
and to the payment of the unpaid balance of all other Secured Obligations. 

 The Collateral Account shall be held in the name of and subject to the exclusive 
dominion and control of the Administrative 
 Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and the L/C Issuer. 
If and when requested by the Borrower, the 
 Administrative Agent shall invest funds held in the Collateral Account from 
time to time in direct obligations of, or obligations 
 the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed 
by, the United States of America with 
a remaining

in the 
 Collateral Account when and as required to make payments out of 
the Collateral Account for application to amounts due and 
 owing from the Borrower to the L/C Issuer, the 
Administrative Agent or the Lenders. 
Subject to the terms of Sections 2.13 and

in subsection (a) above required under Section

amounts held in the Collateral 
 Account so long as at the time of the release and after giving effect 
thereto no Default exists.

Agent under Section 13.4

it has previously been reimbursed 
 for such costs and expenses by the Lenders, in which event such amounts shall be 
remitted to the Lenders to reimburse 
 them for payments theretofore made to the Administrative Agent); 

(b) 
second, to the payment of any outstanding interest and fees due under 
the Loan Documents to be 
 allocated pro rata in accordance with the aggregate unpaid amounts owing 
to each holder thereof;

Section 10.1. 
Appointment and Authority
 . 
Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints 
 BMO Harris Bank N.A.
 to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan 
Documents and 
 authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise 
such powers as are delegated to the 
 Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such 
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 

 The provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative 
Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and 
 neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party 
beneficiary of any of such provisions. 
It is 
 understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other 
Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with 
 reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary 
or other implied (or express) obligations arising 
 under agency doctrine of any applicable law. 
Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create 
 or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 
Section 10.2. 
Rights as a Lender
 . 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same 
 rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the 
same as though it were not the 
 Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise 
expressly indicated or unless the context 
 otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder 
in its individual capacity. 
Such Person 
 and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities 
of, act as the financial advisor or in any other 
 advisory capacity for, and generally engage 
in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate 
 thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder 
and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
 Section 10.3. 
Action by Administrative Agent; Exculpatory Provisions
 . 
(a) The Administrative Agent shall not have 
 any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other 
Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall 
 be administrative in nature. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties: 
 
(i) 
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether 
a Default has 
 occurred and is continuing; 
 
(ii) 
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except 
 discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby 
or by the other Loan Documents that the 
 Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required 
Lenders (or such other number or 
 percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein 
or in the other Loan Documents), 
 provided
 
that the 
 Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion 
of its counsel, may 
 expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document 
or applicable law, including for 
 the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic 
stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that 
 may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property 
of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor 
 Relief Law. 
The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing 
to act hereunder or 
 under any other Loan Document unless it first receives any further assurances 
of its indemnification from the Lenders 
 that it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and 
any other protection it requires against any and 
 all costs, expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason 
of taking or continuing to take any such action; 
 and 
 
(iii) 
shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, 
have any duty or 
 responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any 
information relating to any Loan Party 
 or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the 
Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of 
 its Affiliates in any capacity. 
 
(b) 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for 
any action taken or not taken 
 by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement 
or any other Loan Document or the transactions 
 contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of 
the Required Lenders (or such other number or 
 percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, 
or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, 
 under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 and 13.3), or 
(ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or 
 willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by 
final and nonappealable judgment. 
Any such action 
 taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all Lenders. 
The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not 
 to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such 
Default is given to the Administrative Agent in 
 writing by the Borrower, a Lender, 
or the L/C Issuer. 

(c) 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible 
for or have any duty or 
 obligation to any Lender or L/C Issuer or participant or any other Person 
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty 
 or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any 
other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, 
 report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in 
connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or 
 observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth 
herein or therein or the occurrence of any 
 Default, (iv) the validity, 
enforceability, effectiveness 
or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other 
 agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority 
of any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral 
 Documents, (v) the value or sufficiency of any Collateral, 
or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 
 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required 
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
 
Section 10.4. 
Reliance by Administrative Agent
 . 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall 
 be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, 
request, certificate, communication, 
 consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any 
electronic message, Internet or intranet website 
 posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been 
signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper 
 Person. 
The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone 
and believed by it to 
 have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying 
and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. 

 In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of 
a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or 
 increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction 
of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the 
 Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory 
to such Lender or L/C Issuer unless the Administrative 
 Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or L/C Issuer 
prior to the making of such Loan or the 
 issuance of such Letter of Credit. 
The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for 
the Loan 
 Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall 
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it 
 in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 
Section 10.5. 
Delegation of Duties
 . 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its 
 rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through 
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the 
 Administrative Agent. 
The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and 
all of its duties and exercise its 
 rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. 
The exculpatory provisions of this Section shall apply to any 
 such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent 
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their 
 respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Revolving Facility 
and any Incremental Term Loans 
as well as 
 activities as Administrative Agent. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of 
any 
 sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines 
in a final and nonappealable judgment that the 
 Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct 
in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 
Section 10.6. 
Resignation of Administrative Agent
 . 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its 
 resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Borrower. 
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required 
 Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, 
to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with 
an office in 
 the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such bank with 
an office in the United States of America. 
If no such 
 successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have 
accepted such appointment within thirty (30) 
 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation 
(or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the 
 Required Lenders) (the 
 Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated 
 to), on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative 
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth 
 above. 
Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become 
effective in accordance with such notice 
 on the Resignation Effective Date. 

(b) 
With effect from the Resignation 
Effective Date, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged 
from 
 its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, 
and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to 
 the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications 
and determinations provided to be made by, 
to or 
 through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and 
L/C Issuer directly, until such 
time, if any, as 
 the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent 
as provided for above. 
 If on the Resignation Effective Date no 
 successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Administrative 
Agent s rights in the Collateral Documents 
 shall be assigned without representation, recourse or warranty to the Lenders 
and L/C Issuer as their interests may appear. 

 Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative 
Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed 
to and 
 become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of 
the retiring Administrative Agent (other than any rights to 
 indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), 
and the retiring Administrative Agent shall 
 be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder 
or under the other Loan Documents. 
The fees payable by the 
 Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable 
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed 
 between the Borrower and such successor. 
After the retiring Administrative Agent s 
resignation hereunder and under the other 
 Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 13.4 shall continue 
in effect for the benefit of such retiring 
 Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in 
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken 
 by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative 
Agent. 
 
Section 10.7. 
Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders
 . 
Each Lender and L/C Issuer acknowledges 
 that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent 
or any other Lender or any of their Related 
 Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, 
made its own credit analysis and decision to 
 enter into this Agreement. 
Each Lender and L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and 
without reliance upon 
 the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based 
on such documents and information as it 
 shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in 
taking or not taking action under or based upon 
 this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or 
any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
 Upon a Lender s written request, the Administrative Agent 
agrees to forward to such Lender, when complete, copies 
 of any field audit, examination, or appraisal report prepared by or for the 
Administrative Agent with respect to the Borrower or 
 any Loan Party or the Collateral (herein, 
 Reports). 
Each Lender hereby agrees that (a) it has requested a copy of each Report 
 prepared by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent; (b) the Administrative Agent 
(i) makes no representation or warranty, 
 express or implied, as to the completeness or accuracy of any Report or any of 
the information contained therein or any 
 inaccuracy or omission contained in or relating to a Report and (ii) shall not be 
liable for any information contained in any 
 Report; (c) the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, and 
that any Person performing any field examination 
 will inspect only specific information regarding the Borrower and the other Loan 
Parties and will rely significantly upon the 
 books and records of Borrower and the other Loan Parties, as well as on representations 
of personnel of the Borrower and the 
 other Loan Parties, and that the Administrative Agent undertakes no obligation 
to update, correct or supplement the Reports; (d) 
 it will keep all Reports confidential and strictly for its internal use, not share 
the Report with any other Person except as 
 otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement; and (e) without limiting

 Agreement or an assignment agreement pursuant to Section 13.2, 
as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender with whom 
 the Borrower or any other Loan Party has entered into an agreement creating 
Hedging Liability or Bank Product Obligations 
 shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for purposes of any reference 
in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the 
 Administrative Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that the 
rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan 
 Documents consist exclusively of such Affiliate s 
right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral and the 
 Guaranty Agreements as more fully set forth in Section 9.5. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(i) each such 
 Affiliate of any Lender that has entered into an agreement creating 
Hedging Liability or Bank Product Obligations shall, for the 
 avoidance of doubt, be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of Section 10.15

 have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action 
hereunder or under any other Loan 
 Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release

 any such distribution of payments and collections, or any request for the release of 
the Guaranty Agreements and the 
 Administrative Agent s Liens in connection 
with the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the 
 Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due 
to any Lender or its Affiliate with respect 
 to Hedging Liability or Bank Product Obligations unless such Lender has notified 
the Administrative Agent in writing of the 
 amount of any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution 
or payment or release of Guaranty Agreements 
 and Liens.

 additional powers, duties or responsibilities as a result thereof. 

Section 10.11. 
Authorization to Enter into, and Enforcement 
of, the Collateral Documents; Possession of Collateral

 The Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the 
Lenders and the L/C Issuer to execute and deliver the 
 Collateral Documents on behalf of each of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, 
and their Affiliates and to take such action and exercise 
 such powers under the Collateral Documents as the Administrative Agent considers 
appropriate; 
 provided
 
the Administrative 
 Agent shall not amend the Collateral Documents unless such amendment is agreed 
to in writing by the Required Lenders. 

 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall take 
such action to enforce its Lien on the 
 Collateral and to preserve and protect the Collateral as may be directed 
by the Required Lenders. 
Unless and until the Required 
 Lenders give such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be 
obligated to) take or refrain from taking such 
 actions as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of all the Lenders 
and L/C Issuer. 
Each Lender and L/C Issuer 
 acknowledges and agrees that it will be bound by the terms and conditions of 
the Collateral Documents upon the execution and 
 delivery thereof by the Administrative Agent. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to 
ascertain 
 or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value 
or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, 
 priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent s 
Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection 
 therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable 
to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or their Affiliates for any 
 failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral. 
The Lenders and L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably authorize (and each 
 of their Affiliates holding any Bank Product Obligations and Hedging 
Liability entitled to the benefits of the Collateral shall be 
 deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, based upon 
the instruction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid and purchase 
 (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the 
Collateral at any sale thereof conducted by 
 the Administrative Agent (or any security trustee therefore) under 
the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, including 
 pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code, at any 
sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the 
 United States Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy 
Code, or at any sale or foreclosure 
 conducted by the Administrative Agent or any security trustee therefore (whether 
by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance 
 with applicable law. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, no Lender, 
L/C Issuer, or their Affiliates, other than 
 the Administrative Agent, shall have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding 
in equity or at law for the foreclosure or 
 other realization upon any Collateral or for the execution of any 
trust or power in respect of the Collateral or for the 
 appointment of a receiver or for the enforcement of any other remedy under 
the Collateral Documents; it being understood and 
 intended that no one or more of the Lenders or L/C Issuer or their Affiliates 
shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to 
 affect, disturb or prejudice the Lien of the Administrative 
Agent (or any security trustee therefor) under the Collateral 
 Documents by its or their action or to enforce any right thereunder, 
and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be 
 instituted, had, and maintained by the Administrative Agent (or its security 
trustee) in the manner provided for in the relevant 
 Collateral Documents for the benefit of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, 
and their Affiliates. 
Each Lender and L/C Issuer is hereby 
 appointed agent for the purpose of perfecting the Administrative Agent s 
security interest in assets which, in accordance with 
 Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law can be perfected 
only by possession. 
Should any Lender or 
 L/C Issuer (other than the Administrative Agent) obtain possession of any Collateral, 
such Lender or L/C Issuer shall notify the 
 Administrative Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Administrative Agent s 
request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to 
 the Administrative Agent or in accordance with the Administrative Agent s 
instructions. 

Section 10.12. 
Authorization to Release, Limit or Subordinate 
Liens or to Release Guaranties.
 
The Administrative 
 Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, 
and their Affiliates to (a) release any Lien 
 covering any Collateral that is sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of this 
 Agreement and the relevant Collateral Documents (including a sale, transfer, 
or disposition permitted by the terms of Section 
 8.10 or which has otherwise been consented to in accordance with Section 13.3), 
(b) release or subordinate any Lien on 
 Collateral consisting of goods financed with purchase money indebtedness 
or under a Capital Lease to the extent such purchase 
 money indebtedness or Capitalized Lease Obligation, and the Lien securing 
the same, are permitted by Sections 8.7(b) and 
 8.8(d), (c) reduce or limit the amount of the indebtedness secured by any particular item 
of Collateral to an amount not less than 
 the estimated value thereof to the extent necessary to reduce mortgage registry, 
filing and similar tax, (d) release Liens on the 
 Collateral following termination or expiration of the Commitments and payment 
in full in cash of the Obligations (other than 
 contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination 
of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit 
 that have been Cash Collateralized to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent 
and relevant L/C Issuer) and, if then due, 
 Hedging Liability and Bank Product Obligations, and (e) release any Subsidiary 
from its obligations as a Guarantor if such 
 Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the 
Loan Documents. 
Upon the Administrative 
 Agent s request, the Required Lenders 
will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent s 
authority to release or subordinate its 
 interest in particular types or items of Property or to release any Person form 
its obligations as a Guarantor under the Loan 
 Documents.
 Section 10.13. 
Authorization of Administrative Agent to File Proofs 
of Claim. 

 In case of the pendency of any 
 proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding 
relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative 
Agent 
 (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then 
be due and payable as herein expressed or by 
 declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent 
shall have made any demand on the Borrower) 
 shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

(a) 
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid 
in

 Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, 
expenses, disbursements and advances of the 
 Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due 
the Administrative Agent under Sections 3.1 and 
 13.4. 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent 
to authorize or consent to or accept or 
 adopt on behalf of any Lender or L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, 
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the 
 Obligations or the rights of any Lender or L/C Issuer or to authorize the Administrative 
Agent to vote in respect of the claim of

all Letters of Credit. 
If any amount shall be paid to a 
 Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior 
to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Secured 
 Obligations and all other amounts payable by the Loan Parties hereunder 
and the other Loan Documents and (y) the termination 
 of the Commitments and expiration of all Letters of Credit, such amount shall be held

 Subordinated Creditor, whether now existing 
or hereafter arising, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Secured 
 Obligations. 
During the existence of any Event of Default, subject to Section 11.4, 
any such indebtedness, obligation, or 
 liability of the Borrower or other Loan Party owing to such Subordinated 
Creditor shall be enforced and performance received 
 by such Subordinated Creditor as trustee for the benefit of the holders of the 
Secured Obligations and the proceeds thereof shall 
 be paid over to the Administrative Agent for application to the Secured 
Obligations (whether or not then due), but without 
 reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under 
this Section 11.

 any Lender, the L/C Issuer, 
or any other Person against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or other obligor, 
another 
 guarantor, or any other Person. 

Section 11.7. 
Limit on Recovery
 . 
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of recovery against each 
 Guarantor under this Section 11 shall not exceed

 obligations under this Section 11 void or voidable 
under applicable law, including, 
without limitation, fraudulent conveyance 
 law.

 . 
If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower

or under any agreement relating to 
 Hedging Liability or Bank Product Obligations, is stayed upon the insolvency, 
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or 
 such other Loan Party or obligor, all such 
amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement or the 
 other Loan Documents, or under any agreement relating to Hedging 
Liability or Bank Product Obligations, shall nonetheless be 
 payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative 
Agent made at the request or otherwise with

hereby, the Related Parties of each 
of the

its 
 rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and 
the Loans at the time owing to 
 it); 
 provided
 
that (in each case with respect to any Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the 
following conditions:

 (A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning 
 Lender s Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it (in each 
case with respect to any Facility) or in the case 
 of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, 
no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
 
(B) 
in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate 
amount of the relevant 
 Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) 
or, if the applicable Commitment is not 
 then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the 
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment 
 (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to 
such assignment is delivered to the 
 Administrative Agent or, if 
 Trade Date 
 is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade 
Date) shall 
 not be less than 5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long 
as no Event of Default has occurred 
 and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent

 part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement 
with respect to the Loan or the 
 Commitment assigned. 

(iii) 
 Required Consents. 

 No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required 
 by paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition: 
 
(A) 
the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) 
shall 
 be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing 
at the time of such assignment, or 
 (y) such assignment is to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender; 
 provided
 
that the Borrower shall be deemed to 
 have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written 
notice to the Administrative 
 Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; 
 
(B) 
the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably 
withheld or 
 delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (i) the Revolving 
Facility if such assignment is to a 
 Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the Revolving 
Facility or an Affiliate of such 
 Lender, or (ii) any Incremental Term 
Loans to a Person who is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender; and 
 
(C) 
the consent of each L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender shall be required for any assignment 
 in respect of the Revolving Facility. 
 
(iv) 
 Assignment and Assumption.

 Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing

 provided

in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee 
 in the case of any assignment
 . 
 
The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to 
the Administrative Agent an 
 Administrative Questionnaire. 
 
(v) 
 No Assignment to Certain Persons. 

 No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any 
 other Loan Party or any Loan Party s Affiliates 
or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its 
 Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, 
would constitute any of the foregoing Persons 
 described in this clause (B). 
 
(vi)

 No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a 
 holding company, 
investment vehicle or trust for or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural 
person) 
 (herein any of the foregoing is a natural Person ). 
 
(vii) 
 Certain Additional Payments. 

 In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any 
 Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such 
assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions 
 thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such 
additional payments to the Administrative Agent 
 in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof 
as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases 
 by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating 
actions, including funding, with the 
 consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata 
share of Loans previously requested but 
 not funded by the Defaulting Lender, 
to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably 
 consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by 
such Defaulting Lender to the 
 Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer, the Swingline 
Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued 
 thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans 
and participations in Letters of 
 Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Percentage. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any 
 assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder 
shall become effective under applicable law 
 without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee 
of such interest shall be deemed to be a 
 Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance 
occurs. 
 Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and 
 after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, 
the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this 
 Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and 
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a 
 Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder 
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such 
 Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under 
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and 
 Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations 
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a 
 party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 13.4 and 13.6 
with respect to facts and circumstances 
 occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; 
 provided 
 that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the 
 affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute 
a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder 
 arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations 
 under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of 
this Agreement as a sale by such 
 Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of this Section. 

(c) 
 Register. 

 The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent 
of the Borrower, shall maintain 
 at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment 
and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the 
 recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, 
and principal amounts (and stated interest) of 
 the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the 
 Register). 
The entries in the Register 
 shall be conclusive absent manifest error, 
and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent 
and the Lenders shall treat each Person 
 whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for 
all purposes of this Agreement. 

 The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any 
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to 
time 
 upon reasonable prior notice. 
 
(d) 
 Participations. 

 Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the 
 Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than 
a natural Person or the Borrower or any other Loan Party or 
 any Loan Party s Affiliates 
or Subsidiaries or any other Person prohibited under Section 13.2 (b)(v) 
(each, a 
 Participant) in 
 all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under 
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments 
 and/or the Loans owing to it);
 
provided
 
that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain 
unchanged, (ii) 
 such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the 
performance of such obligations, and (iii) the 
 Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the 
L/C Issuers and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender 
in 
 connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be 
 responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.8 with respect to any payments 
made by such Lender to its Participant(s). 
 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation 
shall provide that such Lender shall 
 retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, 
modification or waiver of any provision of this 
 Agreement; 
 provided 
 that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without 
the consent of the 
 Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described 
in Section 13.3 that expressly relate to amendments 
 requiring the unanimous consent of the Lenders in the Revolving Facility in which 
such Participant participates. 
The Borrower 
 agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.1, 4.4, 
and 4.5 (subject to the requirements and 
 limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 4.1(g) (it being 
understood that the documentation required under 
 Section 4.1(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the 
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its 
 interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; 
 provided 
 that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the 
 provisions of Sections 2.12 and 4.7 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) 
of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to 
 receive any greater payment under Sections 4.1
 or 4.4, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would 
 have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive 
a greater payment results from a Change in Law 
 that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. 
Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the 
 Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts 
to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 
 2.12 with respect to any Participant. 
To the extent permitted by 
law, each Participant also shall be entitled 
to the benefits of 
 Section 13.6 (Right of Setoff) as though it were a Lender; provided 
that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.7 
 (Sharing of Payments by Lenders) as though it were a Lender. 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this 
 purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain 
a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the 
 principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s 
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan 
 Documents (the 
 Participant Register); 
 provided
 
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the 
 Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information 
relating to a Participant s interest 
in any 
 commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under 
any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that 
 such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of 
credit or other obligation is in registered form 
 under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury 
Regulations. 
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive 
 absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each 
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner 
 of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice 
to the contrary. 
For the avoidance of doubt, 
 the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall 
have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant 
 Register. 
 
(e) 
 Certain Pledges. 

 Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion 
of its 
 rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, 
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a 
 Federal Reserve Bank; 
 provided 
 that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations 
 hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 

 Section 13.3. 
Amendments. 
 
Any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may be amended 
or 
 waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by (a) 
the Borrower, (b) the Required Lenders (or 
 the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) 
(except as otherwise stated below to require only the 
 consent of the Lenders affected thereby), and (c) if the rights or 
duties of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, 
or the 
 Swingline Lender are affected thereby,

no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall (A) increase any 
Commitment of any 
 Lender without the consent of such Lender or (B) reduce the amount of 
or postpone the date for any scheduled 
 payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or of any Reimbursement 
Obligation or of any fee payable 
 hereunder without the consent of the Lender to which such payment is owing or 
which has committed to make such 
 Loan or Letter of Credit (or participate therein) hereunder; 
 provided, however,
 
that only the consent of the Required 
 Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the default rate provided in Section 2.9 or 
to waive any obligation of the 
 Borrower to pay interest or fees at the default rate as set forth therein or (ii) to amend any financial 
covenant hereunder 
 (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment 
would be to reduce the rate of interest or any 
 fee payable hereunder; 
 
(ii) 
no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall, unless signed 
by each Lender, change 
 the definition of Required Lenders, change the provisions of this Section 13.3,

 would affect the ratable sharing of setoffs 
required thereby, change 
the application of payments contained in Section 
 3.1 or 9.5, release any material Guarantor or all or substantially all of the Collateral 
(except as otherwise provided for 
 in the Loan Documents), or affect the number of Lenders required 
to take any action hereunder or under any other 
 Loan Document; 

(iii) 
no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall, unless signed by 
each Lender affected 
 thereby, extend 
the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date, or extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit 
 beyond the Revolving Credit Termination 
Date; and 
 
(iv) 
no amendment to Section 11 shall be made 
without the consent of the Guarantor(s) affected thereby. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (1) no Defaulting Lender 
shall have any right to approve or disapprove any 
 amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver 
or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all 
 Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected 
with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), 
 except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased 
or extended without the consent of such Lender 
 and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification 
requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that 
by its terms 
 affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other 
affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender, 
 (2) if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified 
an obvious error or any error or omission of a technical 
 nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative 
Agent and the Borrower shall be 
 permitted to amend such provision, (3) guarantees, collateral security documents 
and related documents executed by the 
 Borrower or any other Loan Party in connection with this Agreement may be 
in a form reasonably determined by the 
 Administrative Agent and may be amended, supplemented or waived without 
the consent of any Lender if such amendment, 
 supplement or waiver is delivered in order to (x) comply with local law or 
advice of local counsel, (y) cure ambiguities, 
 omissions, mistakes or defects or (z) cause such guarantee, collateral security document 
or other document to be consistent with 
 this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (4) the Borrower and 
the Administrative Agent may, 
without the input or 
 consent of any other Lender, effect 
amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary in 
the 
 reasonable opinion of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to effect 
the provisions of Section 2.15, and (5) this Section

and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the 
 gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from 
a claim brought by the Borrower or any other 
 Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee s

 arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action

 agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), 
such L/C Issuer, such Swingline Lender or 
such Related 
 Party, as the case may be, such Lender s 
pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or

 (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such 
Lender); 
 provided

 amounts owed to any L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender solely in its capacity as such,

 or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may

 or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out 
of, in connection with, or as a result of, this 
 Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument 
contemplated hereby, the transactions 
contemplated 
 hereby or thereby, any 
Loan or Letter of Credit, or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Cumulative Remedies.
 
No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, the 
 L/C Issuer, or any Lender, 
or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations, in the exercise 
of any power or right 
 under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence 
in any default, nor shall any single or partial 
 exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof 
or the exercise of any other power or right. 
The 
 rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, 
the Lenders, and of the holder or holders of any of 
 the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which 
any of them would otherwise have.

Section 13.6. 
Right of Setoff.
 
In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under the Loan Documents or 
 applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, if an Event of Default shall 
have occurred and be continuing, 
 each Lender, each L/C Issuer, 
and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized 
at any time and from time to time, to 
 the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, 
to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, 
 provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other 
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by 
 such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate, 
to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party 
 against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or 
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any 
 other Loan Document to such Lender or such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, 
irrespective of whether or not such 
 Lender, L/C Issuer or Affiliate 
shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and 
although 
 such obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured 
or are owed to a branch, office or 
 Affiliate of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different 
from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit 
or obligated on 
 such indebtedness; 
 provided 
 that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, 
(x) all amounts 
 so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent 
for further application in accordance with the provisions 
 of Section 2.13 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by 
such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed 
 held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers, and the Lenders, 
and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall 
 provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in 
reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such 
 Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. 
The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective 
 Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and 
remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, 
such 
 L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. 
Each Lender and L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the 
 Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; 
 provided 
 that the failure to give such notice shall not 
 affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
 Section 13.7. 
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim 
 or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on 
any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder 
 resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the 
aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or 
 other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, 
then the Lender receiving such greater 
 proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) 
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the 
 Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such 
other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit 
 of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the 
aggregate amount of principal of and 
 accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; 
 provided 
 that:
 
(a) 
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment 
giving rise thereto is 
 recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price 
restored to the extent of such recovery, 
 without interest; and 
 
(b) 
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment 
made by the 
 Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement 
(including the application of funds 
 arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration 
for the 
 assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Obligations 
to any assignee or 
 participant, other than to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which 
the provisions of this Section shall 
 apply). 
 Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively 
do so under applicable law, that 
any 
 Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may 
exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff 
 and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender 
were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the 
 amount of such participation. 
 Section 13.8. 
Survival of Representations.
 
All representations and warranties made herein or in any other Loan 
 Document or in certificates given pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive

 other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect 
with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as 
 any credit is in use or available hereunder.
 Section 13.9.
 Survival of Indemnities.

 Credit, including, but not limited to, Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, and 13.4,

 Section 13.14. 
Excess Interest

of any amount of interest in excess of the 
 maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable law to be charged 
for the use or detention, or the forbearance in the 
 collection, of all or any portion of the Loans or other obligations outstanding

to be provided for, herein or in any 
 other Loan Document, then in such event (a) the provisions of this Section shall govern 
and control, (b) neither the Borrower 
 nor any guarantor or endorser shall be obligated to pay any Excess Interest, (c)

 Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been, and shall be, reformed and modified 
to reflect such reduction in the relevant 
 interest rate, and (e) neither the Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall have any 
action against the Administrative Agent 
 or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of the payment 
or collection of any Excess Interest. 
Notwithstanding the 
 foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of Borrower s Obligations 
is calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the 
 applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate 
becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of 
 interest payable on the Borrower s Obligations shall remain at the 
Maximum Rate until the Lenders have received the amount 
 of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period 
on the Borrower s Obligations had the rate of interest 
 not been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period.

Section 13.21.

 Notwithstanding anything to 
 the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement 
or understanding among any such parties, each 
 party hereto (including any party becoming a party hereto by virtue

and agrees and consents to, and 
 acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

the application of any Write-Down and 
Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any 
 such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party 
hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; 
 and 
 
(b) 
the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, 
including, if applicable: 
 
(i) 
a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 

(ii) 
a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments 
of 
 ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or 
a bridge institution that may be issued 
 to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership 
will be accepted by it 
 in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other 
Loan Document; or 
 
(iii) 
the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of 
the write-down 
 and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority. 
 
Section 13.22. 
Amendment and Restatement
 . 
This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Agreement 
 and is not intended to be or operate as a novation or an accord and satisfaction of the Existing Credit 
Agreement or the 
 indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of the Loan Parties evidenced 
or provided for thereunder. 
Without limiting the 
 generality of the foregoing, each Loan Party agrees that notwithstanding 
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the 
 Liens previously granted to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Collateral 
Documents shall be and remain in full force and 
 effect and that any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent 
thereunder and obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder 
 shall be and remain in full force and effect, shall not be affected, 
impaired or discharged thereby (except as expressly amended 
 by the Loan Documents) and shall secure all of the Borrower s indebtedness, 
obligations and liabilities to the Administrative 
 Agent and the Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement as amended and restated 
hereby. 
Without limiting the foregoing, 
 the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that the 
 Credit Agreement and the Notes referred to in the 
 Collateral Documents shall from and after the date hereof be deemed 
references to this Agreement and the Notes issued 
 hereunder. 
 
Section 13.23. 
Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported 
QFCs.
 
(a) To the extent that the Loan 
Documents 
 provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedge Agreements 
or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC 
 (such support, 
 QFC Credit Support 
 , and each such QFC, a 
 Supported QFC), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows 
 with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and 
 Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations 
promulgated 
 thereunder, the 
 U.S. Special Resolution Regimes) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the 
 provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents 
and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be 
 governed by the laws of the State of New York 
and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): 
 In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a 
 Covered Party) becomes subject to 
 a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported 
QFC and the benefit of such 
 QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such 
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, 
 and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) 
from such Covered Party will 
 be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective 
under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the 
 Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation 
and rights in property) were governed 
 by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party 
or a BHC Act Affiliate of 
 a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, 
Default Rights under the 
 Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit 
Support that may be exercised 
 against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent 
than such Default Rights could be 
 exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and 
the Loan Documents were governed by 
 the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without 
limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and 
 agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting 
Lender shall in no event affect the rights of 
 any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. 
 
(b) 
 Certain Defined Terms.
 
As used in this Section 13.23(a): 
 
 BHC Act Affiliate 
 
of a party means an affiliate (as such term is defined under, 
 and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party. 
 
 Covered Entity 
 
means any of the following: (i) a covered entity as that term is 
 defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. 
 252.82(b); (ii) a covered bank 
 as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. 
 47.3(b); or (iii) a 
 covered FSI as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance 
with, 12 C.F.R. 
 382.2(b). 
 
 Default Right 
 
has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted 
 in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. 
 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable. 

QFC 
 
has the meaning assigned to the term qualified financial contract 
in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 
 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
