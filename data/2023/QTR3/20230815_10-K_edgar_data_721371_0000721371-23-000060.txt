 Consolidated Results 
 Fiscal 2023 Overview 
 
 Revenue 
 Revenue for fiscal 2023 was 205.0 billion, a 13 percent increase from the prior year, primarily driven by Pharmaceutical segment sales growth.

 The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
 We had GAAP operating earnings of 727 million and a GAAP operating loss of 596 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included 1.2 billion and 2.1 billion pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charges related to the Medical segment, respectively. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates" section of this MD A and Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional detail. GAAP operating earnings during fiscal 2023 were favorably impacted by litigation recoveries as described further in Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 Non-GAAP operating earnings during fiscal 2023 increased 3 percent to 2.1 billion, primarily driven by an increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit, partially offset by a decrease in Medical segment profit.

 (2) The reconciling items are presented within this table net of tax. See quantification of tax effect of each reconciling item in our GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations in the section titled "Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 (3) For fiscal 2022, GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 279 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. Fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 280 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares. 
 (4) Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposals of assets, net includes pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of 1.2 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, related to the Medical segment recorded during fiscal 2023 and 2022. The net tax benefits related to these charges were 82 million and 150 million, respectively. 
 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, GAAP diluted EPS was adversely impacted by the goodwill impairment charges related to the Medical segment, which had a (4.38) and (6.94) per share after-tax impact, respectively. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive

 During fiscal 2023, GAAP diluted EPS was favorably impacted by litigation recoveries. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 During fiscal 2023, non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 14 percent to 5.79 due to a lower share count, the factors impacting non-GAAP operating earnings described above and lower interest expense, net. 
 
 Cash and Equivalents 
 
 Our cash and equivalents balance was 4.0 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to 4.7 billion at June 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 2.8 billion, which was offset by 2.0 billion in share repurchases, 579 million in debt repayments, 525 million of dividends and 481 million of capital expenditures.

MD A Overview 

 Significant Developments in Fiscal 2023 and Trends 
 Pharmaceutical Segment 
 Generics Program 
 The performance of our Pharmaceutical segment generics program positively impacted the year-over-year comparison of Pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2023. The Pharmaceutical segment generics program includes, among other things, the impact of generic pharmaceutical product launches, customer volumes, pricing changes, the Red Oak Sourcing, LLC venture ("Red Oak Sourcing") with CVS Health Corporation ("CVS Health") and generic pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and sourcing costs. 
 The frequency, timing, magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer volumes, pricing changes, customer contract renewals, generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes and generic pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and sourcing costs all impact Pharmaceutical segment profit and are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may impact Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2024. 
 
 Medical Segment 
 
 Inflationary Impacts 
 Beginning in fiscal 2022, Medical segment profit was negatively affected by inflationary impacts, primarily related to transportation (including ocean and domestic freight), commodities, labor and global supply chain constraints. Since that time, we have taken actions to partially mitigate these impacts, including implementing certain price increases and evolving our pricing and commercial contracting processes to provide us with greater pricing flexibility. In addition, decreases in some product-related costs have been recognized as the higher-cost inventory moved through our supply chain and was replaced by lower cost inventory. These net inflationary impacts negatively affected Medical segment profit during fiscal 2023. 
 We expect these net inflationary impacts to continue to affect Medical segment profit in fiscal 2024 and beyond, but to a significantly lesser extent than in fiscal 2023 and prior periods, due to our mitigation actions, together with continued decreases in certain product-related costs. However, these inflationary costs are difficult to predict and may be greater than we expect or continue longer than our current expectations. Our actions to increase prices and evolve our contracting strategies are subject to contingencies and uncertainties and it is possible that our results of operations will be adversely impacted to a greater extent than we currently anticipate or that we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact to the extent or on the timeline we anticipate . 
 Volumes within Products and Distribution 
 Medical segment profit was adversely impacted during fiscal 2023 on a year-over-year basis in part due to lower volumes within products and distribution, which includes our Cardinal Health branded medical products. We expect Cardinal Health branded medical products sales growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. The timing, magnitude and profit impact of this anticipated sales growth is subject to risks and uncertainties, which may impact Medical segment profit. 
 Medical Unit Goodwill 
 Due to previously communicated changes in our long-term financial plan assumptions, including those related to Cardinal Health branded medical products sales growth, and increases in the risk-free interest rate, we performed goodwill impairment testing for the Medical operating segment (excluding our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division) Medical Unit during fiscal 2023. This testing resulted in cumulative pre-tax charges of 1.2 billion which were included in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). See "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates" section of this MD A and Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional detail. Adverse changes in key assumptions or a significant change in industry or economic trends during fiscal 2024 could result in additional goodwill impairment. 
 
 Shareholder Cooperation Agreement 
 In September 2022, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P.(together, "Elliott") under which our Board of Directors (the "Board"), among other things, (1) appointed four new independent directors, including a representative from Elliott, and (2) formed an advisory Business Review Committee of the Board, which is tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework and operations. In May 2023, we extended the term of the Cooperation Agreement until the later of July 15, 2024 or until Elliott's representative ceases to serve on, or

MD A Overview 

 resigns from, the Board. In connection with this extension, the Board has extended the term of the Business Review Committee until July 15, 2024. 
 The evaluation and implementation of any actions recommended by the Business Review Committee and the Board have impacted and may continue to impact our business, financial position and results of operations during fiscal 2024 and beyond. During fiscal 2023, we incurred 8 million of expenses related to the negotiation and finalization of the Cooperation Agreement and other consulting expenses. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur additional legal, consulting and other expenses related to the Cooperation Agreement and the activities of the Business Review Committee. See "Risk Factors" section for additional detail related to risks associated with the Cooperation Agreement.

 (1) Corporate revenue consists of the elimination of inter-segment revenue and other revenue not allocated to the segments. 
 
 Pharmaceutical Segment 
 Fiscal 2023 Pharmaceutical segment revenue grew by 15 percent primarily due to branded and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth largely from existing and net new customers, which increased revenue by 24.2 billion. 
 Medical Segment 
 Fiscal 2023 Medical segment revenue decrease was driven by products and distribution, which decreased revenue by 1.1 billion, primarily related to lower sales, largely due to an adverse impact from personal protective equipment ("PPE") pricing and volumes. This decrease was partially offset by sales growth in at-Home Solutions, which increased revenue by 215 million. 
 
 Cost of Products Sold 
 
 Cost of products sold for fiscal 2023 increased 23.3 billion (13 percent) due to the factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin.

MD A Results of Operations 

 Gross Margin 

Consolidated Gross Margin (in millions) 2023 2022 Change Gross margin 6,889 6,545 5 
 Fiscal 2023 consolidated gross margin increased primarily due to the Pharmaceutical segment, which reflected the positive performance of our generics program and a higher contribution from branded and specialty pharmaceutical products. This increase was partially offset by the performance of products and distribution within the Medical segment, primarily driven by lower volumes and unfavorable product sales mix, partially offset by a net positive contribution from PPE. 
 Gross margin rate declined 25 basis points during fiscal 2023 mainly due to changes in overall product mix, primarily driven by increased pharmaceutical distribution branded sales, which have a dilutive impact on our overall gross margin rate. This decline in gross margin rate was partially offset by a net positive contribution from PPE. 
 
 Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG A") Expenses 
 
 SG A Expenses (in millions) 2023 2022 Change SG A expenses 4,834 4,557 6 
 Fiscal 2023 SG A expenses increased primarily due to inflationary impacts, primarily related to increased transportation and labor costs, higher operating expenses, including higher costs to support sales growth, and enterprise-wide incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by the beneficial impact of enterprise-wide cost-savings measures.

 Pharmaceutical Segment Profit 
 Fiscal 2023 Pharmaceutical segment profit increased primarily due to the positive performance of our generics program and an increased contribution from branded and specialty pharmaceutical products, partially offset by inflationary impacts, primarily related to increased transportation and labor costs. 
 Medical Segment Profit 
 Fiscal 2023 Medical segment profit decreased primarily due to the performance of products and distribution, largely driven by net inflationary impacts, lower volumes and unfavorable product sales mix, partially offset by a net positive contribution from PPE. 
 Corporate 
 The changes in Corporate during fiscal 2023 are due to the factors discussed in the "Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings/(Loss)" section that follows.

 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

MD A Results of Operations 

 Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings/(Loss) 
 In addition to revenue, gross margin and SG A expenses discussed previously, consolidated operating earnings/(loss) were impacted by the following: 
 (in millions) 2023 2022 Restructuring and employee severance 95 101 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs 285 324 Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net 1,250 2,050 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net (302) 109 
 Restructuring and Employee Severance 
 Restructuring and employee severance costs during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures and the divestiture of the Cordis business. During fiscal 2023, we also incurred restructuring costs related to certain projects resulting from reviews of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework and operations. During fiscal 2022, restructuring costs also included facility exit costs related to decreasing our overall office space. 
 Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs 
 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 281 million and 311 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Impairments and (Gain)/Loss on Disposal of Assets, Net 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized 1.2 billion and 2.1 billion of pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charges, respectively, related to our Medical segment, as discussed further in the "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates" section of this MD A and Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 Litigation (Recoveries)/Charges, Net 
 During fiscal 2023, we recognized income of 103 million, primarily related to a reduction of the reserve for the estimated settlement and defense costs for the Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava ("IVC") product liability due to the execution of certain settlement agreements. During fiscal 2022, we recognized estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with the IVC filter product liability claims of 87 million. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 During fiscal 2023, we recognized income of 93 million due to net proceeds from the settlement of a shareholder derivative litigation matter as described further in the "Legal Proceedings" section. 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized income of 130 million and 18 million, respectively, for net recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff. 
 
 Other Components of Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes 
 
 In addition to the items discussed above, earnings/(loss) before income taxes was impacted by the following: 
 (in millions) 2023 2022 Change Other (income)/expense, net (4) 16 N.M. Interest expense, net 93 149 (38) Loss on early extinguishment of debt 10 N.M. (Gain)/Loss on sale of equity interest in naviHealth (2) N.M. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Fiscal 2023 interest expense decreased from fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents. 
 Loss On Early Extinguishment of Debt 

During fiscal 2022, we recognized a loss of 10 million connection with the debt redemption as described further in Note 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 Fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2023 and 2022 related to the Medical segment . 
 A reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows (see Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information):

 Ongoing Audits 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal 2015 through the current fiscal year. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. New challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments.

MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently believe that, based on available capital resources and projected operating cash flow, we have adequate capital resources to fund our operations and expected future cash needs as described below. If we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital markets for additional financing. 
 Cash and Equivalents 
 
 Our cash and equivalents balance was 4.0 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to 4.7 billion at June 30, 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was 2.8 billion, which includes the impact of our second annual payment of 372 million related to the April 2022 agreement to settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by states and local governmental entities (the "National Opioid Settlement Agreement"). In addition, we deployed 2.0 billion for share repurchases, 579 million for debt repayments, 525 million for dividends and 481 million for capital expenditures. At June 30, 2023, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. 
 At June 30, 2022, our cash and equivalents were 4.7 billion. During fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of 3.1 billion included a refund of 966 million for the tax benefit from the net operating loss carryback related to a self-insurance pre-tax loss. We also received proceeds of 923 million, net of cash transferred, from the divestiture of the Cordis business and we deployed 1.0 billion for share repurchases, 885 million for debt repayments, 559 million for dividends and 387 million for capital expenditures. 

Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases, payments to vendors and tax payments in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix. 
 The cash and equivalents balance at June 30, 2023 included 533 million of cash and equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. 
 In fiscal 2023, we returned 189 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. 
 At June 30, 2023, foreign earnings of approximately 976 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. The computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. For amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2023. 

Other Financing Arrangements and Financial Instruments 
 
 Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper 
 In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity at June 30, 2023 include a 2.0 billion commercial paper program, backed by a 2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We also have a 1.0 billion committed receivables sales facility. At June 30, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility. During fiscal 2023, under our commercial paper program and our committed receivables program, we had maximum combined total daily amounts outstanding of 445 million. 
 In February 2023, we extended our revolving credit facility through February 25, 2028. In September 2022, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC ("CHF") through September 30, 2025. 
 Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75-to-1. As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. 

Long-Term Obligations 
 At June 30, 2023, we had total long-term obligations, including the current portion and other short-term borrowings of 4.7 billion. 
 During fiscal 2023, we repaid the full principal of 550 million of the 3.2 Notes due 2023. 
 During fiscal 2022, we redeemed all outstanding 572 million principal amount of 2.616 Notes due 2022 and recorded a 10 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. We also repaid the full principal of the 282 million Floating Rate Notes due 2022 as they became due. 
 The early redemption and repayments were funded with available cash.

 Capital Deployment 
 
 Opioid Litigation Settlement Agreement 
 We had 5.87 billion accrued at June 30, 2023 related to certain opioid litigation, as further described within Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." We expect the majority of payments to occur through 2038. During fiscal 2023, we paid our second annual payment of 372 million under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement. In July 2023, we made our third annual payment of 378 million under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement. The amounts of these future payments may differ from the payments that we have already made. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 481 million and 387 million, respectively. 
 We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 to be approximately 500 million and primarily related to manufacturing and distribution infrastructure projects and technology investments. 

Dividends 
 During fiscal 2023, we paid quarterly dividends totaling 1.98 per share, an increase of 1 percent from fiscal 2022. 
 On May 11, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0.5006 per share, or 2.00 per share on an annualized basis, which was paid on July 15, 2023, to shareholders of record on July 3, 2023. 
 On August 9, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0.5006 per share, or 2.00 per share on an annualized basis, which will be paid on October 15, 2023, to shareholders of record on October 3, 2023. 
 Share Repurchases 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we deployed 2.0 billion and 1.0 billion, respectively, for repurchases of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with available cash. See Note 11 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. 
 On November 4, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 3.0 billion share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2024. On June 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 3.5 billion share repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2027. At June 30, 2023, we had 4.3 billion remaining authorized for share repurchases under these programs.

 (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is legally enforceable and specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. Purchase obligations and other payments also includes quarterly payments to CVS Health in connection with Red Oak Sourcing. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (5) Represents future cash obligations under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement as well as future cash obligations under separate settlement agreements with the States of Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia and the Cherokee Nation. We have 5.87 billion accrued at June 30, 2023, of which 426 million is included in other accrued liabilities, and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 (6) Long-term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities, have been excluded from the above table due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of income taxes. 

Recent Financial Accounting Standards 
 See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 15 

MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 

 Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that (i) can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment. Other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because estimates are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ. In this section, we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
 The allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging, historical write-off trends, payment history, pricing discrepancies, industry trends, customer financial strength, customer credit ratings or bankruptcies. We regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risks. 
 A hypothetical 0.1 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at June 30, 2023, would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 11 million. We believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2023 are appropriate. 
 At this time, we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future 

increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue. The following table presents information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years: 
 (in millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 2021 Allowance for doubtful accounts at beginning of period 273 243 207 Charged to costs and expenses 197 155 130 Reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write-offs (171) (125) (94) Allowance for doubtful accounts at end of period 299 273 243 Allowance as a percentage of customer receivables 2.6 2.6 2.7 Allowance as a percentage of revenue 0.15 0.15 0.15 

Inventories 
 
 LIFO Inventory 
 A portion of our inventories (55 percent and 52 percent at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, or market. These are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our Pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities ). The LIFO impact on the consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal year-end inventory levels, which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end. Historically, prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise, resulting in an increase in cost of products sold, whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline, resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold. 
 Using LIFO, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation, the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost. Conversely, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline, the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost. 
 We believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities. As such, the 

LIFO reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, inventories valued at LIFO cost were 476 million and 416 million higher than the average cost value. We do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. As such, we did not write-up the value of our inventory from average cost to LIFO cost at June 30, 2023 or 2022. 
 FIFO Inventory 
 Our remaining inventory, including inventory in our Medical segment and certain inventory in our Pharmaceutical segment, that is not valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. We reserve for the lower of cost or net realizable value using the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. In fiscal 2021, we recorded a reserve of 197 million, primarily related to certain categories of gloves, to reduce the carrying value of certain PPE to its net realizable value. Our estimates for selling prices and demand are inherently uncertain and if our assumptions decline in the future, additional inventory reserves may be required. 

16 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 

 Excess and Obsolete Inventory 
 We reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-hand inventory and manufacturer return policies. Inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves 

for excess and obsolete inventory which were 139 million and 147 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions, additional inventory reserves may be required. 

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 
 Purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount, which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). 
 We have two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. These operating segments are comprised of divisions (which are components), for which discrete financial information is available. Components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are: Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division); Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division; Medical operating segment (excluding our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division) Medical Unit and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division. 
 Goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. 
 Our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units in fiscal 2023 was based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches (using discount rates ranging from 9.5 to 11 percent). We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts. Under the market-based guideline public company method, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. We also use the market-based guideline transaction method to 

determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. 
 Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. The use of alternate estimates and assumptions, changes in the industry or peer groups, or changes in weightings assigned to the discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method or guideline transaction method could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment. If a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or operating cash flow, or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans, or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests, the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period. 
 We performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill for Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division); Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division; and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. See additional detail on Medical Unit goodwill below. 
 Medical Unit Goodwill 
 Due to previously communicated changes in our long-term financial plan assumptions made during fiscal 2023, including those related to Cardinal Health branded medical products sales growth and net inflationary impacts, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit at June 30, 2023. This quantitative testing resulted in the carrying amount of the Medical Unit exceeding the fair value, resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of 368 million in the fourth quarter and cumulative pre-tax impairment charges of 1.2 billion due to the impairment charges recognized during the second and first quarters of fiscal 2023 as described further below. The fourth quarter impairment charge was primarily driven by the impact of the reductions in our long-term financial plan assumptions. The impairment charges are included in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). The carrying value of the Medical Unit at June 30, 2023 after recognizing the impairment charges was 5.7 billion, of which 725 million was goodwill. See Note 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion. 

Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 17 

MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 

 We performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of 709 million and 154 million, respectively. The impairment charge recognized in the second quarter was driven by certain reductions in our long-term financial plan assumptions, and the impairment charge recognized in the first quarter was driven by an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the risk-free interest rate. We also performed quantitative goodwill impairment testing at March 31, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill at March 31, 2023 as the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4 percent. 
 Our determinations of the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit were based on a combination of the income-based approach (using a terminal growth rate of 2 percent), and the market-based approaches. Additionally, we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method, 10 percent to the guideline public company method and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method. For the income-based approach, we used discount rates of 10 percent, 10 percent, 10.5 percent and 10.5 percent for fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively. The decrease in the discount rate for the testing performed at March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the risk-free interest rate. 
 While we consider the assumptions used in our determination of the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit to be reasonable and appropriate, they are complex and subjective, and additional adverse changes in one key assumption or a combination of key assumptions during fiscal 2024 may significantly affect future estimates. These assumptions include, among other things, a failure to meet expected earnings or other financial plans, including the execution of key initiatives related to optimizing and growing sales of Cardinal Health branded medical products, increasing growth in certain strategic divisions within our Medical segment, and driving simplification efforts and cost optimization projects, or unanticipated events and circumstances, such as changes in assumptions about the duration and magnitude of increased 

supply chain and commodities costs and our efforts to mitigate such impact, including price increases or surcharges; further disruptions in the supply chain; manufacturing cost inefficiencies resulting from lower than anticipated sales volume; an increase in the discount rate; a decrease in the terminal growth rate; increases in tax rates; or a significant change in industry or economic trends. 
 Adverse changes in key assumptions may result in a decline in fair value below the carrying value in the future and therefore, an impairment of our Medical Unit goodwill in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if we were to increase the discount rate by a hypothetical 0.5 percent to 10.5 percent or decrease the terminal growth rate by a hypothetical 1.75 percent to 0.25 percent, the fair value for the Medical Unit would have further decreased by approximately 250 million. Additionally, a hypothetical 25 basis point decrease in long-term gross margin rates, which could be impacted by changes in Cardinal Health branded medical product sales growth rate assumptions, would have increased the impairment charge by approximately 220 million. 
 Other indefinite-lived intangibles 
 The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks) involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. Our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. 
 See Note 1 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets. 

Loss Contingencies and Self-Insurance 
 
 We regularly review contingencies and self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. Any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. 
 Loss Contingencies 
 We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. 

Examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the IVC filter lawsuits. 

18 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 

 We develop and periodically update reserve estimates for all litigation matters, including IVC claims, received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs. In April 2023, we executed a settlement agreement that, if certain conditions are satisfied, will resolve approximately 4,376 IVC filter product liability claims for 275 million. These settlements will not resolve all IVC filter product liability claims and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the remaining lawsuits. To project future IVC claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, blended average payout influenced by claim severity, historical sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs. 
 Self-Insurance 
 We self-insure through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for employee healthcare, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property and workers' compensation and maintain insurance for losses exceeding certain limits. 

Self-insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. For certain types of exposures, we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available. Other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. For claims incurred but not reported, the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period. 
 The amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Our income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. 
 The following table presents information about our tax position at June 30: 
 (in millions) 2023 2022 Total deferred income tax assets (1) 1,540 1,584 Valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets (2) (421) (468) Net deferred income tax assets 1,119 1,116 Total deferred income tax liabilities (3,164) (3,110) Net deferred income tax liability (2,045) (1,994) 
 (1) Total deferred income tax assets included 671 million and 778 million of loss and tax credit carryforwards at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 (2) The valuation allowance primarily relates to federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. 
 Expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized. After applying the valuation allowances, we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described previously. 
 Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. 

For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 We operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. 
 Tax Effects of Goodwill Impairment Charges 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized cumulative pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of 1.2 billion and 2.1 billion, respectively, related to the Medical Unit. The net tax benefits related to these charges were 82 million and 150 million, respectively. 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. During fiscal 2021, we resolved all open issues with respect to the Company s activity within fiscal years 2008 through 2014 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). This resolution resulted in an adjustment to our provision for income taxes, including an impact to reserves for later years. New challenges related to future audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. 
 Our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment; the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 
 We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. The amount we 

Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 19 

MD A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 

 ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued. Changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions, tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. For a further discussion on Provision for Income Taxes, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code as per the Tax Act as enacted by the United States government on December 22, 2017. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act which is subject to further interpretation by the IRS. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This report, including the "Fiscal 2023 Overview" section within MD A, contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated. 
 Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this report for its own and for investors assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: 
 LIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges and credits from non-GAAP metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results. We did not recognize any LIFO charges or credits during the periods presented. 
 Surgical gown recall costs or income includes inventory write-offs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs, net of related insurance recoveries, arising from the January 2020 recall of select Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") Level 3 surgical gowns and voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns. Income from surgical gown recall costs represents insurance recoveries of these certain costs. We have excluded these costs from our non-GAAP metrics to allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of the business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results. 
 State opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the period in which the expense is incurred. This portion is excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying, ongoing business. Additionally, while states' laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis, the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be one-time, nonrecurring items. Income from state opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years represents reversals of accruals due to changes in estimates or when the underlying assessments were invalidated by a Court or reimbursed by manufacturers. 
 Shareholder cooperation agreement costs includes costs such as legal, consulting and other expenses incurred in relation to the agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") entered into among Elliott Associates, L.P., Elliott International, L.P. (together, "Elliott") and Cardinal Health, including costs incurred to negotiate and finalize the Cooperation Agreement and costs incurred by the Business Review Committee of the Board of Directors, which was formed under this Cooperation Agreement. We have excluded these costs from our non-GAAP metrics because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. 
 Restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and include, but are not limited to, costs related to divestitures, closing and consolidating facilities, changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing, employee severance and realigning operations. 
 Amortization and other acquisition-related costs , which include transaction costs, integration costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 21 

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 companies' financial results. Additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We also exclude other acquisition-related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. These costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions. 
 Impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets, net are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. 
 Litigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount. During fiscal 2022, we incurred a one-time contingent attorneys' fee of 18 million related to the finalization of the settlement agreement (the National Opioid Settlement Agreement resulting in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Due to the unique nature and significance of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, and the one-time, contingent nature of the fee, this fee was included in litigation recoveries or charges, net. Additionally, during fiscal 2022 our Pharmaceutical segment profit was positively impacted by a 16 million judgment for lost profits. This judgment was the result of an ordinary course intellectual property rights claim and, therefore, is not adjusted in calculating the litigation recoveries or charges, net adjustment. During fiscal 2021, we incurred a tax benefit related to a carryback of a net operating loss. Some pre-tax amounts, which contributed to this loss, relate to litigation charges. As a result, we allocated substantially all of the tax benefit to litigation charges. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions. 
 (Gain)/Loss on sale of equity interest in naviHealth was incurred in connection with the sale of our remaining equity interest in naviHealth in fiscal 2020. The equity interest was retained in connection with the initial sale of our majority interest in naviHealth during fiscal 2019. We exclude this significant gain because gains or losses on investments of this magnitude do not typically occur in the normal course of business and are similar in nature to a gain or loss from a divestiture of a majority interest, which we exclude from non-GAAP results. The gain on the initial sale of our majority interest in naviHealth in fiscal 2019 was also excluded from our non-GAAP measures. 
 
 The tax effect for each of the items listed above is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

 2 For fiscal 2022, GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 279 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. Fiscal 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 280 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares. 
 3 Impairments and (gain)/loss on disposals of assets, net includes pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of 1.2 billion and 2.1 billion, related to the Medical segment recorded during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the net tax benefits related to these charges were 82 million and 150 million, respectively, and were included in the annual effective tax rate. 
 4 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net includes a one-time contingent attorneys' fee of 18 million recorded during fiscal 2022 related to the finalization of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement resulting in the settlement of the vast majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Due to the unique nature and significance of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, and the one-time, contingent nature of the fee, this fee was included in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net. 
 5 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net for fiscal 2022 does not include a 16 million judgement for lost profits related to an ordinary course intellectual property claim, which positively impacted Pharmaceutical segment profit. 
 6 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net includes pre-tax charges of 1.17 billion recorded in fiscal 2021, related to the opioid litigation. The net tax benefit associated with the opioid litigation charges was 228 million. 
 7 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, includes a tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2021 related to a net operating loss carryback. Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary recorded a self-insurance pre-tax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation. This self-insurance pre-tax loss, which did not 
 24 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

 impact our pre-tax consolidated results, was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes. The net operating loss was carried back and adjusted our taxable income for fiscal 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security CARES Act. The total benefit from the net operating loss carryback was 424 million; however, for purposes of Non-GAAP financial measures, we allocated 389 million of the benefit to litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, which is excluded from non-GAAP measures, based on the relative amount of the self-insurance pre-tax loss related to opioid litigation claims versus separate tax adjustments. The tax benefit allocated to the separate tax adjustments of 35 million was included in non-GAAP measures. 
 
 The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. 
 We apply varying tax rates depending on the item's nature and tax jurisdiction where it is incurred.

Disclosures about Market Risk 

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks. These market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price-related changes. We maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to some of these market exposures which employs operational, economic and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk. See Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 
 By the nature of our global operations, we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation. These exposures are transactional and translational in nature. The following foreign currencies represent the principal drivers of our foreign exchange exposure: Canadian dollar, euro, Thai baht, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, Philippine peso, Swiss franc and Indian rupee. 
 We apply a Value-At-Risk ("VAR") methodology to our transactional and translational exposures. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. 
 Transactional Exposure 
 Transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries. At the end 

of each fiscal year, we perform sensitivity analyses on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. These analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program, which is designed to mitigate transactional exposure. Applying a VAR methodology to our transactional exposure and including the impact of our hedging program, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be 10 million, which is based on a one-year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. 
 Translational Exposure 
 We have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Applying a VAR methodology to our translational exposure, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be 5 million, which is based on a one-year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management. We utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements. 
 As part of our risk management program related to our debt, we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the upcoming fiscal year. At June 30, 2023, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of 6 million, respectively. 

We are also exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our cash and cash equivalents, which includes marketable securities that are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers' credit worthiness. At June 30, 2023, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest income of 12 million, respectively. 

26 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Disclosures about Market Risk 

Commodity Price Sensitivity 
 
 We are directly exposed to market price changes for certain commodities, including oil-based resins, nitrile, cotton, diesel fuel and latex. We typically purchase raw materials at either market prices or prices tied to a commodity index and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index. During fiscal 2023, the prices of certain commodities continued to experience fluctuation due to inflationary impacts. 
 As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted direct commodity exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. Our forecasted direct commodity exposure at June 30, 2023 increased approximately 40 million from June 30, 

2022. There were no outstanding commodity contracts in our hedging program at June 30, 2023. 
 Our forecasted direct commodity exposures for the upcoming fiscal year is 540 million. The potential gain/loss given a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices, assuming pricing collectively shifts in the same direction and we are unable to change customer pricing in response to those shifts or otherwise offset, for the upcoming fiscal year is 54 million at June 30, 2023.

We provide medical products and pharmaceuticals and cost-effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. 
 Pharmaceutical Segment 
 
 In the United States, our Pharmaceutical segment: 
 through its Pharmaceutical Distribution division, distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical and over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products to retailers (including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers), hospitals and other healthcare providers. This division: 
 maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our retail, hospital and other healthcare provider customers; 
 provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, including distribution, inventory management, data reporting, new product launch support and chargeback administration; 
 distributes specialty pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers and provides consulting, patient support and other services for specialty pharmaceutical products to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers;

 See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Pharmaceutical segment revenue, profit and assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. 

Pharmaceutical and Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services 
 Our Pharmaceutical Distribution division s gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical program, from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, including manufacturers of Specialty pharmaceutical products, and from over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products. It also includes manufacturer cash discounts. 
 Margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts, rebates and service fees from manufacturers and may in limited instances include price appreciation. Our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product, because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time. 
 Margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers. Our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers. In addition, under a limited number of agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers, also serves as part of our compensation. 
 Specialty pharmaceutical products include oncology, rheumatology, urology, nephrology and other pharmaceutical products. Through our Specialty division, we also distribute human-derived plasma products to hospitals, dialysis clinics, physician offices and other healthcare providers. Our use of the term specialty pharmaceutical products may not be comparable to the terminology used by other industry participants. We also provide consulting, patient support, logistics, group purchasing and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers.

The benefits we offer include annual bonuses and stock awards for eligible employees, 401(k) plans, health care and insurance benefits, paid time off, flexible work schedules, family leave, dependent care resources, employee assistance programs and many others. 
 Employee Feedback 
 Cardinal Health solicits feedback from employees through various mechanisms, including our biennial full employee engagement survey, which provides insight into the employee experience. The results of this survey are reviewed with the Board of Directors and at all levels throughout the organization. 
 Diversity, Equity Inclusion 
 At Cardinal Health, we are focused on building a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace that values the unique perspectives and contributions of all of our employees. 
 Our work is sponsored by our senior executives, led by our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE I") team, including our Chief Diversity Officer and HR organization, with input from our DE I Steering Council, Black and African American Racial Equity Cabinet and our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"). 

Additionally, our seven ERGs include groups focused on various racial and ethnic groups, members of the LGBTQ community, employees with disabilities, veterans and women and are designed to promote a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
 We also monitor pay equity. We define pay equity as equal pay for people of all gender identities and ethnicities who are performing substantially similar work. We have a pay equity committee, which guides the ongoing analysis and benchmarking, in regular consultation with an independent third-party, to review and help inform our salary and compensation practices. Some of the things we consider include job-related skills, tenure, experience and education level, performance rating and geography. 
 As of the end of fiscal year 2023, 53 of our Board of Directors were women and 23 were ethnically diverse. 36 of our executive team (made up of the CEO, his direct reports and business presidents) were women and 18 were ethnically diverse. Approximately 50 of our total employee population were women and 50 of U.S. based employees were ethnically diverse. 
 Worker Health Safety 
 The health, safety and security of our employees and contractors is a priority for us. We employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to promote worker safety and identify and prevent or mitigate any potential risks. This includes procedures and equipment for security. We routinely assess facilities to closely monitor adherence to established security and safety standards. Our workers receive specialized training related to their role, work setting and equipment used in their work environment. As our processes evolve, we update relevant safety training modules, which may include new training programs. 
 For more information on our approach to human capital management, please refer to our annual Environmental, Social Governance Report, which is available on our website. 

Intellectual Property 
 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products, services and intangible assets. We hold patents, and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world, relating to the manufacture, operation and use of various medical and surgical products, to certain distribution and logistics systems, to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings. We also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies, and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties. 

We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party. While all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession to be material to our overall business.

Business 

Regulatory Matters 
 
 Our business is highly regulated in the United States, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. Depending upon the specific business, we may be subject to regulation by government entities including: 
 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA 
 certain agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights; 
 state and local health departments, insurance departments, Medicaid departments or other comparable state agencies; 
 state and local boards of pharmacy and other controlled substance authorities; 
 the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC 
 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 
 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"); 
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection; and 
 agencies comparable to those listed above in markets outside the United States. 
 These regulatory agencies have a variety of civil, administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements. They can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products, restrict our ability to import products, require us to initiate product recalls, seize products or impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions. 
 Distribution 
 State Boards of Pharmacy, FDA, DEA and various other state authorities regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the DQSA and Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA"). The CSA governs the sale, packaging, storage and distribution of controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards including effective anti-diversion programs and comply with the CSA. They must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state. 
 The National Opioid Settlement Agreement, as described in Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" includes injunctive relief terms related to settling distributors' controlled substance anti-diversion programs, including with respect to: (1) governance; (2) independence and training of the personnel operating our controlled substances monitoring program; (3) due diligence for new and existing customers; (4) ordering limits for certain products; and (5) suspicious order monitoring. A monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years. In addition, the settling distributors will engage a third-party 

vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting and will fund the clearinghouse for ten years. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information about the National Opioid Settlement Agreement and other opioid-related matters. 
 Manufacturing, Sourcing and Marketing 
 We sell our manufactured products in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and other markets. The FDA and other governmental agencies in the United States, as well as foreign governmental agencies, administer requirements that cover the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing (including good manufacturing practices), quality systems, labeling, promotion and advertising (including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the product's cleared or approved uses), distribution, importation and post-market surveillance for most of our manufactured products. We are also subject to these requirements when we source certain Medical segment products from third-party manufacturers. 
 We need specific approval or clearance from, and registrations with, regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some products in the United States and certain other countries, including countries in the European Union ("EU"). 
 In the United States, authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval PMA ), requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective. Many of our Medical segment branded products are cleared through the 510(k) process and certain products must be approved through the PMA process. 
 In the EU, we are required to obtain CE Mark Certification in order to market medical devices. In 2017, EU regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation ("MDR") became effective in May 2021. Under the MDR, medical devices marketed in the EU require significant pre-market and post-market requirements. 
 It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals, clearances and registrations of medical devices, and they might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations, the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight, including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by FDA and other regulatory authorities both in the United States and internationally. 
 From time to time, we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action, which may include recalling the 

32 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Business 

product, correcting the product at the customer location, revising product labeling and notifying customers. 
 Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively manufacture, source, market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, please see our Risk Factor entitled "Our business is subject to rigorous quality regulatory and licensing requirements." 
 Privacy and Data Protection 
 We are subject to various and evolving privacy laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. Because we collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information, we are subject to laws that require specified privacy and security measures and that regulate the use and disclosure of such information, including the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as augmented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act as well as state laws, in the United States. 
 We also collect, handle and maintain other personal and financial information. Within the U.S., these activities are regulated by certain federal and state laws. Certain states have recently enacted privacy laws that grant specified rights to consumers over the use of their personal information, including increased transparency. Other states are considering adopting similar or different comprehensive privacy laws and a comprehensive federal privacy bill has been proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives. Internationally, we are also subject to privacy and data protection laws that require significant compliance efforts, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information and China's Personal Information Protection Law, among many others. 
 Nuclear Pharmacies and Related Businesses 
 Our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities (including for Xofigo) require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the NRC, applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate, including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices. In addition, our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with FDA regulations, including good manufacturing practices. 
 Product Tracing and Supply Chain Integrity 
 Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or "Track and Trace," establishes a phased-in national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to detect, prevent and rapidly respond to the introduction of drugs that may be counterfeit, diverted, stolen, adulterated, subject of a fraudulent transaction or otherwise unfit for distribution. The first phase of implementation began in 2015, and upon full implementation, which is planned for late 2023, we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an 

electronic, interoperable, prescription drug tracing system. In addition, the FDA also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier. The MDR, described above, also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement. 
 Government Healthcare Programs 
 We are subject to U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws. These laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order, recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other federally-funded healthcare programs. They also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government. There are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to Medicaid and other state-funded healthcare programs. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments). 
 Some businesses within each of our segments are Medicare-certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state Medicaid programs and the federal 340B drug pricing program. These businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations, including applicable reporting, billing, payment and record-keeping requirements. Other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. For example, during fiscal year 2022, we agreed to pay approximately 13 million to the Department of Justice and our Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution business entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in connection with an investigation into discounts and rebates offered or provided to certain Specialty customers. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information on this matter. 
 Our U.S. federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. Failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work. 

Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K

Business 

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws 
 In the United States and other countries, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, including laws regulating the production or use of hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices. Additionally, industry participants, including us, rely on ethylene oxide ("EtO") and other compounds to sterilize certain medical products that we manufacture or distribute. Regulatory actions have been taken by certain environmental regulatory authorities to reduce EtO emissions during the sterilization and distribution process, including actions intended to regulate facilities that sterilize medical products. 
 Antitrust Laws 
 The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Violations of these laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. 
 Laws Relating to Foreign Trade and Operations 
 U.S. and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. We also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties. 
 Similarly, we are subject to U.S. and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-bribery laws. Among other things, these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

Other Information 
 
 Certain Commercial Practices 
 Although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges, our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements. Certain customer contracts require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands, but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels. 

Our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. We only allow customers to return product for credit that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or that can be returned to vendors for credit. 
 We offer market payment terms to our customers. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plan Adoptions and Modifications 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, no director or officer adopted, modified or terminated a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule10b5-1 trading arrangement" as each term is defined in Section 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

Risk Factors 

Risk Factors 
 The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. These are not the only risks we face. Our businesses also could be affected by risks we do not currently consider material to our operations or of which we are not presently aware. 
 Legal, Regulatory Compliance Risks 
 Opioid-related legal proceedings and the National Opioid Settlement Agreement we have entered into could have additional or unexpected negative effects on our results of operations or business . 
 Cardinal Health, along with other pharmaceutical wholesalers and other participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain has been named as a defendant in lawsuits related to the distribution of opioid pain medications. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits include state attorneys general, counties and municipalities, as well as private parties, such as unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, businesses and individuals. 
 We have also received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"). We have also received civil subpoenas and other requests for information from other DOJ offices. 
 In April 2022, an agreement settling the vast majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against us by state and local governmental entities (the "National Opioid Settlement Agreement") became effective. Under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, we agreed to pay up to approximately 6.3 billion over 18 years. The National Opioid Settlement Agreement also includes injunctive relief terms relating to distributors' controlled substance anti-diversion programs. A monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions until 2027. In addition, the distributors agreed to engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund until 2032. It is possible that the maintenance of the required changes to distributors' controlled substance anti-diversion programs may result in unforeseen costs or operational challenges which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or performance. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, or are alleged to have failed to comply with these requirements, we could incur unforeseen costs or penalties, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. 
 In addition to the claims covered by the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, we are also being sued by private plaintiffs, such as unions, other health and welfare funds, hospital systems, third party payors, other healthcare providers and individuals alleging personal injury for the same activities and could be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these lawsuits; however, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and it is possible that these lawsuits, 

either individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 We are involved in legal proceedings with insurers related to the availability of insurance coverage for some matters described above, but the defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and investigations are subject to uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or liquidity beyond the amounts accrued and beyond what we may be able to recover from our insurers. Additionally, laws governing insurance coverage vary by state and some state courts have interpreted laws and insurance policies in ways that may negatively impact our ability to receive indemnification under our insurance policies. 
 Other legislative, regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, several states have adopted or proposed taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids. These laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted. Additionally, certain states have proposed legislation that may conflict with certain requirements of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement. 
 Ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications, as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits, investigations, regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations. 
 Our business is subject to other rigorous quality, regulatory and licensing requirements. 
 As described in greater detail in the "Business" section, products that we manufacture, source, distribute or market must comply with quality and regulatory requirements. Noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance, including noncompliance by third-party contract manufacturers, has in the past, and may in the future result in suspension of our ability to distribute, import, manufacture or source products, as well as product bans, recalls, safety alerts or seizures, or criminal or civil sanctions, which, in turn, could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. In addition, it can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device or other product, and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Also as described in greater detail in the "Business" section, our business is highly regulated in the United States, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we fail 

36 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Risk Factors 

to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 To lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to obtain and hold permits, product registrations, licenses and other regulatory approvals from, and to comply with operating and security standards of, numerous governmental bodies. Failure to maintain or renew necessary permits, product registrations, licenses or approvals, or to comply with required standards, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We, and third parties acting on our behalf, collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. Regulations currently in place continue to evolve, and they are extensive and complex. Compliance with these laws is difficult and costly. New laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect, handle and maintain personal or patient information, or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. From time to time, we become aware of certain isolated alleged violations of federal, state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection. When we become aware of such allegations, we investigate and, if warranted, notify affected people, entities and regulatory bodies. As a result of these violations we have been and may in the future be subject to civil or criminal penalties, breach of contract claims, lawsuits, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. 
 We are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. From time to time, regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices, and may challenge them. We are periodically subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments), which could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs or other remedial measures. 
 Some businesses within each of our segments are Medicare-certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state Medicaid programs and the federal 340B drug pricing program. In addition, some businesses manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. 
 Private challenges to government healthcare policy may also have a significant impact on our business. For example, the federal 340B drug pricing program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer discounts on certain drugs purchased by covered entities, and some of our Pharmaceutical segment customers are covered 

entities or contract pharmacies for covered entities. Over a dozen pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally restricted sales under the 340B drug pricing program to contract pharmacies. These practices are the subject of ongoing litigation; however, if manufacturers continue this practice and if courts uphold this practice, our customers may be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact our business. 
 Industry participants, including us, rely on ethylene oxide EtO and per- and polyfluoroalkyl PFA compounds to sterilize certain medical products, including products that we manufacture or distribute. Regulatory enforcement actions have been taken by certain environmental regulatory authorities to reduce emissions of these compounds during the sterilization and distribution process. If such measures become more widespread, we could experience increased costs to comply with reduced emissions standards and it is possible that we and other industry participants may be unable to effectively sterilize medical products, possibly resulting in supply shortages or an industry-wide reduction in surgical or medical procedures, which would negatively impact demand for our Medical segment s products. Such increased costs or industry-wide reductions in surgical and medical procedures would have a negative impact on our Medical segment profit. Additionally, we have been named as a defendant in several lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of EtO emissions. As a result of a notice of violation we received from an environmental regulator in Georgia, we are making specified changes to a replenishment center in that state. It is possible that these or future regulatory actions or lawsuits could adversely impact our ability to procure products to distribute, resulting in increased costs or industry supply disruptions. 
 Our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. Failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work. 
 Our global operations (including transition services in connection with divestitures) are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If we fail to comply, or are alleged to fail to comply, with any of these laws, we could be subject to investigations or suffer civil or criminal sanctions. 
 We are also subject to government import and export controls and regulations, including the requirement that we make a determination, based on the best information that we have available at the time, as to the country of origin of products that we source or manufacture outside the United States. U.S. Customs and Border protection may challenge our determinations, which have resulted in products being detained and supply disruptions, and which could result in the imposition of fines and penalties. 

Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 37 

Risk Factors 

We could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or 
 challenges to our tax positions. 
 We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and many foreign countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions. 
 From time to time, proposals are made in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate or tax payments. Specific initiatives that may impact us include possible increases in U.S. or foreign corporate income tax rates or other changes in tax law to raise revenue, the repeal of the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, the establishment or increase in taxation at the U.S. state level on the basis of gross revenues, recommendations of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission s investigation into illegal state aid. In August 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which imposed a 15 percent corporate minimum tax on certain large corporations and a 1 percent tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022. These provisions may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 
 Additionally, in connection with the accruals taken in connection with opioid-related lawsuits in fiscal year 2021, we recorded a net tax benefit, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Act ("Tax Act"); however, these estimates require significant judgment and it is possible that they could be subject to challenges by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). 
 The U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the Tax Act. The taxing authorities could challenge our interpretation of the Tax Act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits, or tax law could change again. We also regularly review these estimates and assumptions from time to time and adjust our accruals based on our review, resulting in changes in our tax provisions/(benefit). The actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information regarding these matters. 
 In fiscal year 2021, our provision for income taxes reflected a 424 million benefit from the tax benefits of a self-insurance pre-tax net operating loss carryback under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act. Also, as a result of this net operating loss carryback, we received a U.S. federal income tax refund of 966 million. It is possible that the IRS could challenge our tax position with respect to this self-insurance loss. If these initiatives are successful, our effective tax rate or cash flows could be adversely impacted. Additionally, laws governing insurance coverage vary by state and some state courts have interpreted laws and insurance policies in ways that may impact our self- 

insurance loss, which could negatively impact our financial position. 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year. Proposed adjustments in ongoing audits may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. 
 Changes to the U.S. healthcare environment may not be favorable to us. 
 Over a number of years, the U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs and increase efficiencies. These changes include a general decline in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models and the industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients homes. 
 We expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Possible changes include changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing, healthcare services, mandated benefits, efforts to promote increased transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including with respect to Pharmacy Benefit Managers, further reduction of or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level or efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services. These possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may directly or indirectly adversely affect us. 
 Legal proceedings could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations. 
 Due to the nature of our business, which includes the distribution of controlled substances and other pharmaceutical products and the sourcing, marketing and manufacturing of medical products, we regularly become involved in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 For example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the Risk Factor titled " Opioid-related legal proceedings and the National Opioid Settlement Agreement we have entered into could have additional or unexpected negative effects on our results of operations or business" and in Note 7 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 
 Additionally, some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury, subjecting us to product liability claims. For example, since July 2021, we have entered into settlement 

38 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Risk Factors 

agreements to settle approximately 7,300 product liability claims alleging personal injuries associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase IVC filter products. Product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain and we do not expect insurance coverage to cover all losses incurred for these matters. It is possible that future settlements of or judgments for product liability claims may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries. If this happens, and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess of any prior accruals, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. 
 In connection with legal proceedings, we occasionally enter into settlement agreements or become subject to consent decrees containing ongoing financial or operational obligations, including the injunctive relief provisions of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement and the Corporate Integrity Agreement mentioned above. Failure to comply with obligations under these agreements or decrees could lead to monetary or other penalties. 
 Business Operational Risks 
 Our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, critical facilities and distribution networks and could be negatively impacted by events outside of our control. 
 We rely on our and third-party service providers' information systems for a wide variety of critical operations, including to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: 
 facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; 
 receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; 
 manage accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; 
 process payments to suppliers; 
 facilitate manufacturing and assembly of medical products; and 
 generate financial information. 
 Our business also depends on the proper functioning of our and our suppliers' business processes, critical facilities, including our national logistics center, and our distribution networks. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service provider's business processes, information systems, critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted (including disruption of access), are damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as climate change-related weather events, including wildfires, hurricanes, extreme temperatures or other natural disasters, pandemics (as they were by the COVID-19 pandemic) or power outage, or due to cyber-security incidents, 

ransomware or other actions of third parties, including labor strikes or shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action, production quality deviations, safety issues or raw material shortages or defects, or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities. Additionally, we incur costs to remediate these disruptions, and it is possible that these costs could be significant. 
 Our ability to compete effectively is increasingly dependent on access to and interpretation of data. Data quality impacts customer ordering, order fulfillment and higher order processing. If we fail to effectively implement and maintain data governance structures across our businesses or to effectively interpret and utilize such data, our operations could be impacted and we may be at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a material cyber-attack or other systems breach. 
 Our business relies on the secure transmission, storage and hosting of patient-identifiable health information, financial information and other sensitive protected information relating to our customers, company, workforce and individuals with whom we and our customers conduct business. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. 
 Unauthorized parties have gained access in the past, and will continue to attempt to gain access, to our or a service provider's systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. We have been the target of cyber attacks. Although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us, either individually or in the aggregate, similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business, reputation or financial results. 
 Any compromise of our or a service provider's information systems, including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information, could adversely impact our operations, results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements, including the EU general data protection regulation (GDPR) and those related to patient-identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information as further described in the Risk Factor titled Our business is subject to other rigorous quality, regulatory and licensing requirements, above. 
 In addition, insurance for losses arising from cyber-attacks or other breaches is becoming more costly and limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain. It is possible that we could incur losses that may not be covered by insurance or that would exceed

Risk Factors 

available insurance recoveries. If this happens, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our goodwill or other long-lived assets could be impaired, which could require us to record additional significant charges to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 U.S. GAAP requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. In addition, we review intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
 Due to previously communicated changes in our long-term financial plan assumptions made during fiscal 2023, including those related to Cardinal Health branded medical products sales growth and net inflationary impacts, we performed quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit for periods ended June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, and recorded an aggregate 1.2 billion impairment to goodwill in fiscal year 2023. During fiscal 2022, as a result of adverse financial results in our Medical Unit resulting from inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints, we performed goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit and recorded an aggregate 2.1 billion impairment to goodwill in fiscal year 2022. 
 Impairment testing involves estimates and significant judgments by management. We believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate; however additional adverse changes in key assumptions, a failure to meet expected earnings or other financial plans, including the execution of key initiatives related to optimizing and growing sales of Cardinal Health branded medical products, increasing growth in certain strategic divisions within our Medical segment and driving simplification efforts and cost optimization projects, or unanticipated events and circumstances, such as changes in assumptions about the duration and magnitude of increased supply chain and commodities costs and our efforts to mitigate such impact, including price increases or surcharges; further disruptions in the supply chain; manufacturing cost inefficiencies resulting from lower than anticipated sales volume; an increase in the discount rate; a decrease in the terminal growth rate; increases in tax rates; or a significant change in industry or economic trends could affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and may result in an additional goodwill impairment in our Medical Unit. It is also possible that we may record significant charges from impairment to goodwill of other reporting units, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Any charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates" in MD A above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing. 
 Our sales and credit concentration is significant. 
 CVS Health and OptumRx are large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue. CVS Health accounted for 25 percent of our fiscal 2023 revenue and 23 percent of our gross 

trade receivable balance at June 30, 2023 and OptumRx accounted for 16 percent of our fiscal 2023 revenue. Our agreement with OptumRx extends through June 2024. If either of these customers significantly reduces their purchases from us, defaults in payment to us, does not renew their agreements or terminates their agreements, whether due to an alleged default by us or otherwise, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. 
 We regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business. For example, in July 2023, we contributed our Outcomes business to Transaction Data Systems in exchange for a minority stake in the combined entity, and in fiscal year 2022, we completed the divestiture of the Cordis business. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We could also incur higher costs or charges than planned or incur unexpected charges and could experience greater dis-synergies than expected, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 Our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition. 
 From time to time, we look to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses. Completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks, including the following: we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition; our management s attention may be diverted to integration efforts; we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets; we may face difficulties or delays establishing, integrating or combining operations and systems, including manufacturing facilities; we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business; we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; or we may encounter unforeseen internal control, regulatory or compliance issues. 
 Failure to effectively or efficiently complete or manage critical business processes could have unforeseen consequences. 
 From time to time, our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes, such as receiving and processing customer orders, customer service and accounts payable. For example, during fiscal 2022, our Pharmaceutical segment implemented a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems and we have also transitioned certain finance processes to a third-party service provider. If any of these initiatives or similar initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained, or if our relationship with critical third-party service providers deteriorates, we could experience material negative impacts on our business and our internal control over financial reporting. 

40 
 Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 

Risk Factors 

Our business could be affected by activist shareholders. 
 In September 2022, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Elliott under which our Board of Directors, among other things, (1) appointed four new independent directors, including a representative from Elliott , and (2) formed an advisory Business Review Committee of the Board, which is tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework and operations. In May 2023, we extended the term of the Cooperation Agreement until the later of July 15, 2024 or until an Elliott representative ceases to serve on, or resigns from, our Board of Directors. 
 The Cooperation Agreement may create unintended consequences, such as creating uncertainty about our management, operations or future strategic direction, which could result in the loss of future business opportunities or negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified talent. Additionally, implementing any actions recommended by the Business Review Committee and the Board may be costly and time-consuming, may be disruptive to our ongoing business operations and may ultimately be unsuccessful. 
 It is possible that activist shareholders may, among other things, attempt to effect additional changes and exert influence over our Board of Directors and management or initiate a proxy contest, which may disrupt our operations by diverting the attention of management and the Board and be costly and time-consuming. Any such proxy contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist shareholders, may cause the market price for our shares to experience volatility, which could be significant. 
 Industry Economic Risks 
 We could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures. 
 As described in greater detail in the "Business" section, we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic. In addition, competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models, new entrants, new regulations, changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics. Our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors, which adversely affects our margins. If we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures, additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products, our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected. 
 Our Pharmaceutical segment s profit margin could be adversely affected by changes in industry or market dynamics that we are not able to accurately predict. 
 As has been the case for several years, the frequency, timing, magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer purchase volumes, pricing changes, customer contract renewals, generic pharmaceutical launches and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain as does their impact on Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings. These factors have contributed to declines in some prior years and have more than offset the benefits from 

sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health. If performance of our generic pharmaceutical program declines in future fiscal years and we are unable to offset the decline, our Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will be adversely affected. 
 With respect to branded pharmaceutical products, compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer. Sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost. 
 Also, almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them. However, under certain agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation. If manufacturers, in the aggregate, change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost, decide to reduce prices, not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our margins could be adversely affected. 
 We depend on direct and indirect suppliers to make their 
 products and raw materials available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs, availability and regulatory risk associated with these products and raw materials. 
 Our manufacturing businesses use oil-based resins, pulp, cotton, latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. Prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly, causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we experienced higher supply chain costs, which had a negative impact on Medical segment profit in fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023. Supply chain constraints have also had a negative impact on sales within our Medical segment. 
 W e did not offset the full impact of these cost increases in fiscal year 2023; however, we implemented certain cost reductions, price increases and surcharges to mitigate the impact. Due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations, passing along cost increases is challenging. If we are not able to continue to increase prices as planned or if supply cost increases do not continue to normalize as expected, Medical segment profit could be negatively impacted to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. 
 We depend on others to manufacture some products that we market and distribute. Our operations are also dependent on various components, compounds, raw materials and energy supplied by others. We purchase many of these components, raw materials and energy, and source certain products from numerous suppliers in various countries. In some instances, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, we procure 

Cardinal Health | Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 
 41 

Risk Factors 

certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. Our supplier relationships could be interrupted, become less favorable to us or be terminated and the supply of these components, compounds, raw materials or products could be interrupted or become insufficient. 
 These supply interruptions or other disruptions in manufacturing processes could be caused by events beyond our control, including natural disasters, supplier facility shutdowns, defective raw materials, the impact of epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and actions by U.S. or international governments, including import or export restrictions or tariffs. For example, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which went into effect in June 2022 prohibits the importation of any goods grown, produced, manufactured or mined, wholly or in part, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China unless importers can provide clear and convincing evidence that goods were not made using forced labor. We have experienced some supply constraints as a result of these and similar regulations, and it is possible that our business or results of operations could be further negatively impacted by future determinations and disruptions. 
 In addition, due to the stringent regulatory requirements regarding the manufacture and sourcing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components, materials or products. A sustained supply reduction or interruption, and an inability to develop alternative and additional sources for such supply, could result in lost sales, increased cost, damage to our reputation, and may have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Employee attrition may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or internal controls. 
 Our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified and experienced employees, including key executives and other talent, is critical for us to meet our business objectives. We compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees. It is possible that we could experience loss of key personnel for a variety of causes. If we do not adequately plan for succession of key roles or if we are not successful in attracting or retaining new talent, our performance or internal control over financial reporting could be adversely impacted. 
 Consolidation in the U.S. healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations. 
 In recent years, U.S. healthcare industry participants, including distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, healthcare providers, insurers and pharmacy chains, have consolidated or formed strategic alliances. Consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents. If this consolidation trend continues, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Changes or uncertainty in U.S. or international trade policies and exposure to economic, political and currency and other risks could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results. 
 We conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including Europe, Asia and Latin America. Global developments can affect our business in many ways. Our global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and competition. Additionally, divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries. 
 Our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws, tariffs, excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials. Changes or uncertainty in U.S. or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers. We may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products. This could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, we conduct our business in U.S. dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars. We may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures, and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures. 
 Geopolitical dynamics caused by political, economic, social or other conditions in foreign countries and regions may continue to impact our business and results of operations. Both of our segments have experienced increased costs in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, including for fuel, and it is possible that we could experience supply disruptions or shortages if tariffs or other protective measures are enacted.

 Legal Proceedings 
 In addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Legal Proceedings" section by reference. 
 Between June 2019 and January 2020, three purported shareholders filed actions on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to effectively monitor Cardinal Health's distribution of controlled substances and approving certain payments of executive compensation. In January, 2020, the court consolidated these derivative cases under the caption In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Derivative Litigation and in March 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. 
 In December 2021, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter and in October 2022, the court entered an order approving the settlement and dismissing the case. This settlement does not include any admission of liability. Under the settlement, in December 2022, Cardinal Health's director and officer liability insurance carriers, on behalf of the defendants, paid Cardinal Health 124 million, less approximately 31 million in attorneys' fees and expenses awarded by the court to plaintiffs' counsel.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) as of June 30, 2023. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions, or because compliance with policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria ). Based on management s assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023. 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst Young LLP s report appears following this "Management Reports" section and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings/(loss), comprehensive income/(loss), shareholders' equity/(deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated August 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings/(loss), comprehensive income/(loss), shareholders' equity/(deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

 Medical Unit Goodwill Description of the Matter 
 At June 30, 2023, goodwill related to the Company s Medical segment, including the Medical Unit was 2.0 billion. As discussed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, or when indicators of impairment exist. During fiscal 2023, the Company recognized goodwill impairment charges related to the Medical Unit of 1.2 billion. 
 
 Auditing management s goodwill impairment test for the Medical Unit was challenging because there is significant judgement required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company-specific risk premium, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management s review of significant judgmental assumptions, including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company-specific risk premium, among other assumptions. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Company s Medical Unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating methodologies used; involving our valuation specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the fair value; and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, changes to customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the assumptions within the model and tested the model s computational accuracy. In addition, we inspected the Company s reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the result. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company s disclosures included in Notes 1 and 4 in relation to this matter. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 Description of the Matter 
 
 As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits related to its uncertain tax positions were approximately 1.0 billion at June 30, 2023. Uncertain tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. 
 
 Auditing management's estimate of the amount of tax benefit related to the Company's uncertain tax positions that qualified for recognition was challenging because management's estimate required significant judgment in evaluating the technical merits of the positions, including interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, including the Company s assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and management s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and national tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, where applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company s analysis. For example, we evaluated the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based, and, where applicable, obtained the Company s correspondence with local tax authorities. We used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity, where applicable, with local income tax authorities, to evaluate the Company s accounting for its uncertain tax positions. We evaluated developments in the applicable tax jurisdictions to assess potential effects on the Company s positions. We analyzed the Company s assumptions and data used to evaluate the appropriateness of the Company s measurement of tax benefits. We have also evaluated the Company s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters.

Our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the GPO, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangements . 
 percent and percent at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, or market. These inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our Pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories. The LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold, so LIFO helps us better match current costs and revenue. We believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities. As such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. 
 At June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, inventories valued at LIFO cost were million and million higher than the average cost value. We do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. As such, we did not write-up the value of our inventory from average cost to LIFO cost at June 30, 2023 or 2022. 
 Our remaining inventory, including inventory in our Medical segment and certain inventory in our Pharmaceutical segment, that is not valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices and estimated sales demand in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. During fiscal 2021 we recorded a reserve of million, primarily related to certain categories of gloves, to reduce the carrying value of certain personal protective equipment to its net realizable value.

 operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. These operating segments are comprised of divisions (components), for which discrete financial information is available. Components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are: Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division); Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division; Medical operating segment (excluding our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division) Medical Unit and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division. 
 Fair value can be determined using market, income or cost-based approaches. Our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. Under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant, and include an estimate of long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts. During fiscal 2023, discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from to percent. Under the market-based guideline public company method, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. We also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. To further

 The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. Our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. 
 Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships; trademarks, trade names and patents; and developed technology, are amortized using a combination of straight-line and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the assets over their estimated useful lives. We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts.

 Third-Party Returns 
 We generally do not accept non-merchantable pharmaceutical product returns from our customers, so many of our customers return non-merchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties. Since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers, our vendors pass the value of such returns to us (usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction). We, in turn, pass the value received to our customer. In certain instances, we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor. Although we believe we have satisfactory protections, we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers. We have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolution.

 In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, restructuring costs were primarily related to the implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures and the divestiture of the Cordis business. During fiscal 2023, we also incurred restructuring costs related to certain projects resulting from reviews of our strategy, portfolio, capital-allocation framework and operations.

 Due to changes in our long-term financial plan assumptions made during fiscal 2023, including those related to Cardinal Health branded medical products sales growth and net inflationary impacts, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit at June 30, 2023. This quantitative testing resulted in the carrying amount of the Medical Unit exceeding the fair value, resulting in a pre-tax impairment charge of million and cumulative pre-tax impairment charges of billion in fiscal 2023, due to the impairment charges recognized during the second and first quarters of fiscal 2023 as described further below. This impairment charge was primarily driven by the impact of the reductions in our long-term financial plan assumptions. The impairment charges were included in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). 
 We performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit at December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022, which resulted in pre-tax impairment charges of million and

million, respectively. We also performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment testing at March 31, 2023 and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill at March 31, 2023 as the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent. The impairment charge recognized in the second quarter was driven by certain reductions in our long-term financial plan assumptions, and the impairment charge recognized in the first quarter was driven by an increase in the discount rate primarily due to an increase in the risk-free interest rate. 
 Our determinations of the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit at June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were based on a combination of the income-based approach (using a terminal growth rate of percent), and the market-based approaches. For the income-based approach, we used discount rates of percent, percent, percent and percent for fourth, third, second and first quarters, respectively. The decrease in the discount rate for the interim testing performed at March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in the risk-free interest rate. Additionally, we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method, 10 percent to the guideline public company method and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method. Our fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. 
 During fiscal 2022, we performed quantitative goodwill impairment testing for the Medical Unit which resulted in cumulative pre-tax impairment charges billion, which were included in impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). 
 In connection with the divestiture of the Outcomes business, during fiscal 2023, we allocated and reclassified million of goodwill from the Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division) to the Outcomes disposal group based on the estimated relative fair values of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained.

 Other Financing Arrangements 
 In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity include a billion commercial paper program backed by a billion revolving credit facility. We also have a billion committed receivables sales facility. 
 In February 2023, we extended our billion revolving credit facility through February 25, 2028. In September 2022, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC CHF through September 30, 2025. CHF was organized for the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling undivided interests in those receivables to third-party purchasers. Although consolidated with Cardinal Health, 

Inc. in accordance with GAAP, CHF is a separate legal entity from Cardinal Health, Inc. and from our subsidiary that sells receivables to CHF. CHF is designed to be a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets are available solely to satisfy the claims of its creditors.

 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. Under the OSA, each licensed manufacturer and distributor would be required to pay a portion of the assessment based on its share of the total morphine milligram equivalents sold or distributed in New York during the applicable calendar year, beginning in 2017. Subsequently, New York passed a new statute that modified the assessment going forward and limited the OSA to two years (2017 and 2018). 
 We accrue contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we paid the State of New York million, our portion of the assessment for calendar year 2017. At June 30, 2022, we had an accrual of million, which represented our estimate of our portion of the assessment for calendar year 2018. During the fiscal 2023, we recorded million of income to reduce this accrual to the invoiced amount for the calendar year 2018 assessment and we paid million. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We become involved from time to time in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters. 
 From time to time, we determine that products we distribute, source, manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a potential quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. Such actions have led to product recalls, costs to repair or replace affected products, temporary interruptions in product sales, restrictions on importation, product liability claims and lawsuits and can lead to action by regulators. Even absent an identified regulatory or quality issue or product recall, we can become subject to product liability claims and lawsuits. 
 From time to time, we become aware through employees, internal audits or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as 

complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, financial reporting, auditing, or other ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws such as healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. In addition, from time to time, we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various federal or state agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer, supplier or other industry participants. Internal investigations, subpoenas or requests for information could directly or indirectly lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us or result in sanctions. 
 We have been named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government. 
 We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. 
 We recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets. 
 We recognize estimated loss contingencies for certain litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation (recoveries)/charges in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss); however, losses and recoveries of lost profits from disputes that occur in the ordinary course of business are included within segment profit. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Pharmaceutical segment profit was positively impacted by a million judgment for lost profits related to an ordinary course intellectual property rights claim. 
 Opioid Lawsuits and Investigations 
 Cardinal Health, other pharmaceutical wholesalers and other participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain have been named as a defendant in lawsuits related to the distribution of opioid pain medications. These lawsuits seek equitable relief and monetary damages based on a variety of legal theories, including various common law claims, such as public nuisance, negligence, unjust enrichment, personal injury, as well as violations of controlled

 billion accrued for these matters, of which million is included in other accrued liabilities and the remainder is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual, whether as a result of settlement discussions, a judicial decision or verdict or otherwise, but we are not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible additional losses for these matters. We continue to strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits and none of these agreements is an admission of liability or wrongdoing. Please see below for additional description of these matters. 
 States Political Subdivisions 
 In February 2022, we along with two other national distributors (collectively, the "Distributors") independently approved a settlement and settlement agreement (the "National Opioid Settlement Agreement") to settle the vast majority of opioid lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions. This National Opioid Settlement Agreement became effective on April 2, 2022. In addition to the Distributors, parties to the National Opioid Settlement Agreement include states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Over 99 percent of political subdivisions (by population as calculated under the National Opioid Settlement Agreement) that had brought opioid-related suits against us have chosen to join the National Opioid Settlement Agreement or have had their claims addressed by state legislation (together with settling states and territories, the Settling Governmental Entities). 
 As of July 2023, we have paid the Settling Governmental Entities approximately billion and will pay Settling Governmental Entities additional amounts up to billion through 2038. The National Opioid Settlement Agreement also includes injunctive relief terms related to distributors controlled substance anti-diversion programs. A monitor will oversee compliance with these 

provisions until 2027. In addition, the Distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which distributors will fund until 2032. As a result of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement, most lawsuits brought against us by states and other political subdivisions have been dismissed. We continue to engage in resolution discussions with certain nonparticipating political subdivisions, including the Attorney General for the State of Alabama, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all remaining lawsuits. 
 Other Settlements 
 West Virginia subdivisions and Native American tribes were not a part of the National Opioid Settlement Agreement and we had separate negotiations with these groups. In July 2022, a judgment in favor of the Distributors was entered in bench trial before a federal judge in West Virginia in a case brought by Cabell County and City of Huntington. In July 2022, the Distributors reached an agreement to settle the opioid-related claims of the majority of the remaining West Virginia subdivisions. Under this agreement, we agreed to pay eligible West Virginia subdivisions up to approximately million over an eleven-year period. This agreement became effective in October 2022 when all participating subdivisions dismissed their cases. 
 In October 2022, we executed a final settlement agreement with the Native American Tribes, pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately million over five years. In connection with this settlement, the court entered dismissals for the Native American tribes cases. 
 Private Plaintiffs 
 The National Opioid Settlement Agreement does not address claims by private parties, which includes unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, businesses and individuals alleging personal injury. Private parties had brought approximately lawsuits as of August 8, 2023. Of these, are purported class actions. The causes of action asserted by these plaintiffs are similar to those asserted by public plaintiffs. We are engaged in resolution discussions with certain private plaintiffs; however, we are vigorously defending ourselves in all of these matters. 
 A trial in a case involving plaintiffs began in state court in Georgia in January 2023 and concluded in March 2023 with a verdict for the company and other defendants on all claims. In July 2023, the judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial. A trial involving eight hospital plaintiffs that was scheduled to begin in Alabama in July 2023 was stayed and we do not know when it will be rescheduled. 
 Insurance Litigation 
 We are involved in ongoing legal proceedings with insurers related their obligations to reimburse us for defense and indemnity costs in connection with the lawsuits described above. During fiscal year 2023, we received approximately million in insurance recoveries related to these matters, however, we have not recorded a receivable for any additional recoveries related to these insurance litigation matters as of June 30, 2023.

 product liability lawsuits coordinated in Alameda County Superior Court in California involving claims by approximately plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of IVC filter products. These lawsuits sought a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. The divestiture of the Cordis business did not include product liability related to the IVC filters in the U.S. and Canada, which we retained. 
 In April 2023, we executed a settlement agreement that, if certain conditions are satisfied, will resolve approximately claims for million. This settlement agreement is subject to certain conditions, including certain opt-in thresholds. Between May and September 2023, we will make settlement payments totaling million into a qualified settlement fund, which will be disbursed to the plaintiffs if required conditions are satisfied. Since July 2021, we have also entered into other agreements to settle approximately product liability claims. While these settlements will resolve the vast majority of IVC filter product liability claims, they will not resolve all of them, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the remaining lawsuits. 
 Additionally, in August 2021, the Attorney General for the State of New Mexico filed an action against certain IVC filter manufacturers, including us, alleging claims under New Mexico's Unfair Practices Act, Medicaid Fraud Act and Fraud Against Taxpayers Act. The allegations made are similar to those made in the product liability lawsuits. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. 
 We recognized income of million during fiscal 2023, primarily related to a reduction of the reserve for the estimated settlement and defense costs for these matters due to the execution of the settlements noted above. At June 30, 2023, we had a total of million accrued for losses and legal defense costs, related to the IVC filter product liability lawsuits in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Shareholder Securities Litigation 
 In August 2019, the Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension Relief Fund filed a purported class action complaint against Cardinal Health and certain current and former officers and employees in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our common shares between March 2015 and May 2018. In June 2020, the court appointed 1199 SEIU Health Care Employees Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and a consolidated amended complaint was filed in September 2020. The amended complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by making misrepresentations and omissions related to the acquisition integration of the Cordis business and inventory and supply chain problems within the Cordis business, and seeks to recover unspecified damages and equitable relief for the alleged misstatements and omissions. The complaint also alleges that one of the individual defendants violated Section 20A of the Exchange Act because he sold shares of Cardinal Health stock during the 

time period. In February 2023, we reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle this matter for million, subject to final approval by the court. The court granted its preliminary approval in April 2023 and will conduct a final hearing in September 2023. If the settlement is approved, our insurance carriers will pay million to the plaintiffs. In fiscal year 2023, we have received approximately million in insurance recoveries for costs incurred in connection with this matter. 
 Other Civil Litigation 
 Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing Antitrust Litigation 
 In December 2019, pharmaceutical distributors including us were added as defendants in a civil class action lawsuit filed by indirect purchasers of generic drugs, such as hospitals and retail pharmacies. The indirect purchaser case is part of a multidistrict litigation consisting of multiple individual class action matters consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that pharmaceutical distributors encouraged manufacturers to increase prices, provided anti-competitive pricing information to manufacturers and improperly engaged in customer allocation. In May 2020, the court granted our motion to dismiss. In July 2022, the indirect purchasers filed an amended complaint and in August 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss the intended complaint. We are vigorously defending ourselves in this matter. 
 Antitrust Litigation Proceeds 
 We received and recognized income resulting from settlements of lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff of million , million and million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
 Between June 2019 and January 2020, three purported shareholders filed actions on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to effectively monitor Cardinal Health's distribution of controlled substances and approving certain payments of executive compensation. In January 2020, the court consolidated these derivative cases under the caption In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Derivative Litigation and in March 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. 
 In October 2022, the court entered an order approving the settlement agreement reached between the parties and dismissing the case. The settlement does not include any admission of liability. Under this settlement, in December 2022, Cardinal Health's director and officer liability insurance carriers, on behalf of the defendants, paid Cardinal Health million, less approximately million in attorneys' fees and expenses awarded by the court to plaintiffs' counsel. Cardinal Health received net cash proceeds resulting from this settlement of million, which was recognized in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, during the fiscal year 2023.

 Tax Effects of Goodwill Impairment Charges 
 During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recognized cumulative pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of billion and billion, respectively, related to the Medical Unit. The net tax benefits related to these charges were million and million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Tax Effects of Self-Insurance Pre-Tax Loss 
 During fiscal 2021, our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary recorded a self-insurance pre-tax loss in its fiscal 2020 statutory financial statements primarily related to opioid litigation. This self-insurance pre-tax loss, which did not impact our pre-tax consolidated results, was deducted on our fiscal 2020 consolidated federal income tax return and contributed to a significant net operating loss for tax purposes. The net operating loss was carried back and applied to adjust our taxable income for fiscal 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 as permitted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act enacted by the United States Congress in March 2020. 
 Accordingly, our provision for income taxes during fiscal 2021 included a million benefit from the net operating loss carryback primarily to reflect the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate during the fiscal years from 2015 to 2018 percent for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 and percent for 

fiscal 2018) and the current federal statutory income tax rate of 21 percent. 
 In fiscal 2021, we filed for a refund of million and in April 2022, we received a payment for million, which was net of certain adjustments. We also increased our non-current deferred tax liability by approximately million during fiscal 2021 related to this matter. 
 We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of tax law; however, it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge these tax benefits. The actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates. 
 Tax Effects of Opioid Litigation Charges 
 In connection with the billion pre-tax charge for the opioid litigation recorded during fiscal 2021, the net tax benefit was approximately million. Our tax benefits are estimates, which reflect our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation and are net of unrecognized tax benefits of million. 
 We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act"); however, these estimates require significant judgment since the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the Tax Act. Further, it is possible Congress or the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the Tax Act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits. The actual amount of the tax benefit may differ materially from these estimates.

The income tax rate was and ) in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 compared to an income tax benefit rate of ) in fiscal 2021. Fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of goodwill impairment in fiscal 2023 and 2022, impact of opioid litigation in fiscal 2021, as well as the impact of the carryback claim filed in accordance with the CARES Act provision in fiscal year 2021. Additionally, laws governing insurance coverage vary by state and some state courts have interpreted laws and insurance policies in ways that may impact our self-insurance loss, which could negatively impact our financial position. 
 Our effective tax rate has benefits from negotiated lower than statutory tax rates in select foreign jurisdictions which individually are not material to our effective tax rate but in aggregate had a favorable tax impact of approximately million during fiscal 2023. 
 As of June 30, 2023, foreign earnings of approximately million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. The computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. For amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2023.

 At June 30, 2023 we had gross federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards of million, billion and billion, respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of million. Substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years. Approximately million of the valuation allowance at June 30, 2023 applies to certain federal, state and international loss carryforwards that, in our opinion, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense. 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
 We had billion, million and million of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 balances include million, million and million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate.

 and a net decrease of up to million, exclusive of penalties and interest. 
 We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. At June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had million, million and million, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. These balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of our IRS audit settlements and carryback claim, an immaterial amount of interest was recorded in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
 Other Tax Matters 
 We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2015 through the current fiscal year. 
 Expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly based on available information. This information may support either an increase or a decrease in the required valuation allowance. After applying the valuation allowances, we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. We operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. 
 We are a party to a tax matters agreement with CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson and Company. Under the tax matters agreement, CareFusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to our fiscal 2010 spin-off of CareFusion.

 Fair Value Hedges 
 We enter into pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss recorded on the pay-floating interest rate swaps is directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying debt. Both the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are adjusted to market value at the end of each period with any resulting gain or loss recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were gains or losses recorded to interest expense as changes in the market value of our derivative instruments offset changes in the market value of the underlying debt. 
 During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we entered into pay-floating interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million, million and million, respectively. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 During fiscal 2021, we unwound certain interest rate swap contracts with the notional amount of million. In connection 

with the unwind of these contracts, we received cash proceeds of million. The related gain was recognized in interest expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) over the remaining term of the debt agreement, which matured in March 2023.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted transactions. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 During fiscal 2021, we terminated forward interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million that were entered into in fiscal 2020 because the forecasted transactions were probable of not occurring. As a result, we reclassified an immaterial deferred gain from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense, net in our consolidated statements of earnings/(loss). 
 Gains currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedges to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months are immaterial. 
 We enter into foreign currency contracts to protect the value of anticipated foreign currency revenues and expenses. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, we held contracts to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. The principal currencies hedged are the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Thai baht, Euro, Japanese yen, Philippine peso, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, British pound and Swiss franc. 
 We enter into commodity contracts to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain commodities used in our Medical segment.

 Cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are marked-to-market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. To the extent the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are not highly effective, changes in carrying value attributable to the change in spot rates are recorded in earnings. 
 Pre-tax gains and losses from net investment hedges recorded in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss were a million loss and a million gain during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gains recognized in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings/(loss) for the portion of the net investment hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were million and million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges 
 We enter into foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign exchange exposure related to sales transactions, intercompany financing transactions and other balance sheet items subject to revaluation that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through earnings. The gain or loss recorded on these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The settlement of the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability are both recorded in other (income)/expense, net.

 Segment Profit 
 We evaluate segment performance based on segment profit, among other measures. Segment profit is segment revenue, less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses. Segment SG A expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, legal and compliance, including certain litigation defense costs. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided and other ratable allocation methodologies. The results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit. 
 We do not allocate the following items to our segments: 
 last-in first-out, or ("LIFO"), inventory charges/(credits);
