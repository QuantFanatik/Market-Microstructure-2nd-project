 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview Ferrellgas Partners is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1994 and is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane and related equipment sales. Our Class A Units are traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol FGPR. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners and the Preferred Unitholders are the only limited partners of the operating partnership. Ferrellgas, Inc. is the sole general partner of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership and, excluding the economic interests attributable to the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, owns an approximate 1 general partner economic interest in each, and, therefore, an effective 2 general partner economic interest in the operating partnership. Excluding the economic interests attributable to the Preferred Units, Ferrellgas Partners owns an approximate 99 limited partner interest in the operating partnership. For information regarding the economic and other terms of the Class B Units and the Preferred Units, see Note J Equity (Deficit) and Note I Preferred units to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our general partner performs all management functions for us. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, currently beneficially owns approximately 23.4 of our outstanding Class A Units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100 by an employee stock ownership trust. The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings, except for interest expense related to the Ferrellgas Partners Notes during the relevant historical periods. Business We are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the United States. We believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal 2023 and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers. Our operations primarily include the distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Sales from propane distribution are generated principally from transporting propane purchased from third parties to propane distribution locations and then to tanks on customers premises or to portable propane tanks delivered to nationwide and local retailers. Sales from portable tank exchanges, nationally branded under the name Blue Rhino, are delivered primarily through a network of partnership-owned distribution outlets and to a lesser extent through independently-owned distribution outlets. Our market areas for our residential and agricultural customers are generally rural while our market areas for our industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers are generally suburban. In the residential and industrial/commercial markets, propane is primarily used for space heating, water heating, cooking and other propane fueled appliances. In the portable tank exchange market, propane is used primarily for outdoor cooking using gas grills. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for crop drying, space heating, irrigation and weed control. In addition, propane is used for a variety of industrial applications, including as an engine fuel burned in the internal combustion engines of vehicles and forklifts and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes. A substantial majority of our gross margin from propane and other gas liquids sales is derived from the distribution and sale of propane and related risk management activities. Our gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents-per-gallon difference between the sales price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations.

 The distribution of propane to residential customers generally involves large numbers of small volume deliveries. Our retail deliveries of propane are typically transported from our retail propane distribution locations to our customers by our fleet of bulk delivery trucks, which are generally fitted with tanks ranging in size from 2,600 to 3,500 gallons. Propane storage tanks located on our customers premises are then filled from these bulk delivery trucks. We also deliver propane to our industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers using our fleet of portable tank and portable tank exchange delivery trucks, truck tractors and portable tank exchange delivery trailers. We track Propane sales volumes, Revenues Propane and other gas liquids sales and Gross Margin Propane and other gas liquids sales by customer; however, we are not able to specifically allocate operating and other costs by customer in a manner that would determine their specific profitability with a high degree of accuracy. The wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions, including inflation, and may fluctuate based on changes in demand, supply and other energy commodity prices, primarily crude oil and natural gas, as propane prices tend to correlate with the fluctuations of these underlying commodities. As of July 31, 2023, approximately 69 of our residential customers utilize our equipment, while the remainder own their tanks. Our rental terms and the fire safety regulations in some states require rented bulk tanks to be filled only by the propane supplier owning the tank. The cost and inconvenience of switching bulk tanks helps minimize a customer s tendency to switch suppliers of propane on the basis of minor variations in price, helping us minimize customer loss. In addition, we lease tanks to some of our independent distributors involved with our delivery of propane for portable tank exchanges. Our owned and independent distributors provide portable tank exchange customers with a national delivery presence that is generally not available from most of our competitors. In our past three fiscal years, our total annual propane sales volumes in gallons were: In our past three fiscal years, our total annual propane sales volumes in gallons were: 

Propane sales volumes Fiscal year ended (in millions) July 31, 2023 808 July 31, 2022 831 July 31, 2021 860 In fiscal 2023, no one customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues. We utilize marketing programs targeting both new and existing customers by emphasizing: our efficiency in delivering propane to customers;
 
 our employee training and safety programs;
 our enhanced customer service, facilitated by our technology platform and our 24 hours a day, seven days a week emergency retail customer call support capabilities; and
 
 our national distributor network for our commercial and portable tank exchange customers.
 
 Some of our propane distribution locations also conduct the retail sale of propane appliances and related parts and fittings, as well as other retail propane related services and consumer products. Our other activities in our propane operations and related equipment sales segment include the following: the sale of refined fuels, and
 common carrier services.

 Effect of Weather and Seasonality Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes during the months of November through March (the winter heating season ). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures in the winter heating season will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures in the winter heating season will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can also significantly impact this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and cash flow. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and cash flow as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. The market for propane is seasonal because of increased demand during the winter heating season primarily for the purpose of providing heating in residential and commercial buildings. Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters, which are during the winter heating season. However, our propane by portable tank exchange business experiences higher volumes in the spring and summer, which include the majority of the grilling season. These volumes add to our operating profits during our first and fourth fiscal quarters due to those counter-seasonal business activities. These sales also provide us the ability to better utilize our seasonal resources at our propane distribution locations. Other factors affecting our results of operations include competitive conditions, volatility in energy commodity prices, timing of acquisitions and general economic conditions in the United States. We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. We define normal temperatures based on a 10-year average of information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for weather trends compared to the prior fiscal year as well as to normal heating degree days. We believe that our broad geographic distribution helps us reduce exposure to regional weather and economic patterns. During times of colder-than-normal winter weather, we have been able to take advantage of our large, efficient distribution network to avoid supply disruptions, thereby providing us a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. Risk Management Activities Commodity Price Risk We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short-term basis. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Our propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

Table of Contents 
 Our risk management activities may include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures, swaps, and options to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments primarily with brokers who are clearing members with the Intercontinental Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and, to a lesser extent, directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within GAAP and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled. Through our supply procurement activities, we purchase propane primarily from energy companies. Supplies of propane from these sources have traditionally been readily available, although no assurance can be given that they will be readily available in the future. We may purchase and store inventories of propane to avoid delivery interruptions during the periods of increased demand and to take advantage of favorable commodity prices. As a result of our ability to buy large volumes of propane and utilize our national distribution system, we believe we are in a position to achieve product cost savings and avoid shortages during periods of tight supply to an extent not generally available to other propane distributors. During fiscal 2023, ten suppliers accounted for approximately 57 of our total propane purchases. Because there are numerous alternative suppliers available, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that this supplier concentration could cause a near-term severe impact on our ability to procure propane, though propane prices could be affected; however, if supplies were interrupted or difficulties in obtaining alternative transportation were to arise, the cost of procuring replacement supplies may materially increase. These transactions are accounted for at cost in Cost of sales propane and other gas liquids sales in our consolidated statements of operations. A portion of our propane inventory is purchased under supply contracts that typically have a one-year term and a price that fluctuates based on spot market prices. In order to limit overall price risk, we will enter into fixed price over-the-counter propane forward and/or swap contracts that generally have terms of less than 36 months. We may also use options to hedge a portion of our forecasted purchases, which generally do not exceed 36 months in the future. Executing our price risk management strategy includes regularly issuing letters of credit and posting cash collateral. We also incur risks related to the price and availability of propane during periods of much colder-than-normal weather, temporary supply shortages concentrated in certain geographic regions and commodity price distortions between geographic regions. We attempt to mitigate these risks through our transportation activities by utilizing our transport truck and railroad tank car fleet to distribute propane between supply or storage locations and propane distribution locations. The propane we sell to our customers is generally transported from gas processing plants and refineries, pipeline terminals and storage facilities to propane distribution locations or storage facilities by our leased railroad tank cars, our owned or leased highway transport trucks, common carriers, or owner-operated transport trucks. Industry Natural gas liquids are derived from petroleum products and are sold in compressed or liquefied form. Propane, the predominant natural gas liquid, is typically extracted from natural gas or separated during crude oil refining. Although propane is gaseous at normal pressures, it is compressed into liquid form at relatively low pressures for storage and transportation. Propane is a clean-burning energy source, recognized for its transportability and ease of use relative to alternative forms of stand-alone energy sources. Based upon industry publications propane accounts for approximately 4 of energy consumption in the United States, a level which has remained relatively constant for the past two decades. Propane competes primarily with natural gas, electricity and fuel oil as an energy source principally on the basis of price, availability and portability. Propane serves as an alternative to natural gas in rural and urban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required. Propane is generally more expensive than natural gas on an equivalent British Thermal Unit BTU basis in locations served by natural gas, although propane is often sold in such areas as a standby fuel for use during peak demands and during interruption in natural gas service. The expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital costs required to expand distribution and pipeline systems. Although the extension of natural gas pipelines tends to displace propane distribution in the neighborhoods affected, we believe that new opportunities for propane sales arise as more geographically remote neighborhoods are developed.

 Propane has historically been less expensive to use than electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking and competes effectively with electricity in the parts of the country where propane is less expensive than electricity on an equivalent BTU basis. Although propane is similar to fuel oil in application, market demand and price, propane and fuel oil have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets. Because residential furnaces and appliances that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Residential propane customers will have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than propane. Conversely, we may be unable to expand our retail customer base in areas where fuel oil is widely used, particularly the northeast United States, unless propane becomes significantly less expensive than fuel oil. However, many industrial customers who use propane as a heating fuel have the capacity to switch to other fuels, such as fuel oil, on the basis of availability or minor variations in price. Competition In addition to competing with marketers of other fuels, we compete with other companies engaged in the propane distribution business. Competition within the propane distribution industry stems from two types of participants: the larger, multi-state marketers, including farmers cooperatives, and the smaller, local independent marketers, including rural electric cooperatives. Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2023, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. Most of our retail propane distribution locations compete with three or more marketers or distributors, primarily on the basis of reliability of service and responsiveness to customer needs, safety and price. Each retail distribution outlet operates in its own competitive environment because propane marketers typically reside in close proximity to their customers to lower the cost of providing service. Business Strategy Our business strategy includes the following: expand our market share through disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, as accretive opportunities become available; capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale; and maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform. 
 Expand our market share through disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, as accretive opportunities become available We expect to continue the expansion of our propane customer base through both the acquisition of other propane distributors and through organic growth. We intend to concentrate on propane acquisition activities in geographical areas within or adjacent to our existing operating areas, and on a selected basis in areas that broaden our geographic coverage. We also intend to focus on acquisitions that can be efficiently combined with our existing propane operations to provide an attractive return on investment after taking into account the economies of scale and cost savings we anticipate will result from those combinations. Our goal is to improve the operations and profitability of our propane operations and related equipment sales segment by integrating best practices and leveraging our established national organization and technology platforms to help reduce costs and enhance customer service. We believe that our enhanced operational synergies, improved customer service and ability to better track the financial performance of operations provide us a distinct competitive advantage and better analysis as we consider future opportunities. We believe that we are positioned to successfully compete for growth opportunities within and outside of our existing operating regions. Our efforts will focus on adding density to our existing customer base, providing propane and complementary services to national accounts and providing other product offerings to existing customer relationships. This continued expansion will give us new growth opportunities by leveraging the capabilities of our operating platforms.

Table of Contents 
 Capitalize on our national presence and economies of scale We believe our national presence of 803 propane distribution locations in the United States as of July 31, 2023 gives us advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include economies of scale in areas such as: product procurement; transportation; fleet purchases; propane customer administration; and general administration. 
 We believe that our national presence allows us to be one of the few propane distributors that can competitively serve industrial/commercial and portable tank exchange customers on a nationwide basis, including the ability to serve such propane customers through leading home-improvement centers, mass merchants and hardware, grocery and convenience stores. In addition, we believe that our national presence provides us opportunities to make acquisitions of other propane distribution companies whose operations overlap with ours, providing economies of scale and significant cost savings in these markets. We also believe that investments in technology similar to ours require both a large scale and a national presence, in order to generate sustainable operational savings to produce a sufficient return on investment. For these reasons, we believe our national presence and economies of scale provide us with an on-going competitive advantage. Maximize operating efficiencies through utilization of our technology platform We believe our significant investments in technology give us a competitive advantage to operate more efficiently and effectively at a lower cost compared to most of our competitors. We do not believe that many of our smaller competitors will be able to justify similar investments in the near term. Our technology advantage has resulted from significant investments made in our retail propane distribution operating platform together with our state-of-the-art tank exchange operating platform. Our technology platform allows us to efficiently route and schedule our customer deliveries, customer administration and operational workflow for the retail sale and delivery of bulk propane. Our service centers are staffed to provide oversight and management to multiple distribution locations, referred to as service units. We operate a retail distribution network, including portable tank exchange operations, using a structure of 49 service centers and 803 service units as of July 31, 2023. The service unit locations utilize hand-held computers and cellular or satellite technology to communicate with management personnel who are typically located at the associated service center. We believe this structure and our technology platform allow us to more efficiently route and schedule customer deliveries and significantly reduce the need for daily on-site management. The efficiencies gained from operating our technology platform allow us to consolidate our management teams at fewer locations, quickly adjust the sales prices to our customers and manage our personnel and vehicle costs more effectively to meet customer demand. Our customer support capabilities allow us to accept emergency customer calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week. These combined capabilities provide us cost savings while improving customer service by reducing customer inconvenience associated with multiple, unnecessary deliveries. Governmental Regulation - Environmental and Safety Matters Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations governing the storage, distribution and transportation of propane. However, propane is not currently subject to any price or allocation regulation and has not been defined by any federal environmental law as an environmentally hazardous substance.

 In connection with all acquisitions of propane distribution businesses that involve the purchase of real property, we conduct a due diligence investigation to attempt to determine whether any substance other than propane has been sold from, stored on or otherwise come into contact with any such real property prior to its purchase. At a minimum, due diligence includes questioning the sellers, obtaining representations and warranties concerning the sellers compliance with environmental laws and visual inspections of the real property. Nevertheless, if hazardous substances are discovered on or under these properties, we may be responsible for removing or remediating the previously disposed substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed responsible parties are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damage to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances may have been released. With respect to the sale and distribution of propane, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA under its Hazard Communication Standard HCS ), which requires preparation and maintenance of safety data sheets, hazard labeling on products, and other worker protections. In 2012, OSHA promulgated new hazard communications requirements designed to align U.S. HCS standards with those of other countries under a Globally Harmonized System. These hazard labeling and communication changes, which took effect in June 2015, required us and other propane manufacturers and distributors to revise and update our consumer and compliance materials. With respect to the transportation of propane by truck, we are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of flammable materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation DOT ). The National Fire Protection Association Pamphlet No. 58 establishes a national standard for the safe handling and storage of propane. Those rules and procedures have been adopted by us and serve as the industry standard by the states in which we operate. We believe that we are in material compliance with all governmental regulations and industry standards applicable to environmental and safety matters. Governmental Regulation - Climate Change Legislation There continues to be concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change and the contribution of greenhouse gas GHG emissions, most notably carbon dioxide, to global warming. Because propane is considered a clean alternative fuel under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, we anticipate that this will provide us with a competitive advantage over other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and coal, to the extent new climate change regulations become effective. At the same time, increased regulation of GHG emissions, especially in the transportation sector, could impose significant additional costs on us, our suppliers and our customers. In recent years, there has been an increase in state initiatives aimed at regulating GHG emissions. For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency established a cap-and-trade program that requires certain covered entities, including propane distribution companies, to purchase allowances to compensate for the GHG emissions created by their business operations or obtain qualifying offset credits. The impact of new legislation and regulations will depend on a number of factors, including (i) which industry sectors would be impacted, (ii) the timing of required compliance, (iii) the overall GHG emissions cap level, (iv) the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and (v) the costs and opportunities associated with compliance.

Various factors exist that pose risk to our business and the risk factors listed below outline some of the most significant risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may affect our business. These risks are categorized by: (1) those related to our business and industry, (2) those inherent in an investment in our Class A Units, Class B Units or our debt securities and others related to our capital structure and financing arrangements, (3) those arising from our partnership structure and relationship with our general partner, and (4) those related to tax. Despite their ordering, these categories are not listed by priority, significance, or materiality. Additional risks, uncertainties, and assumptions may exist that are unforeseen, or currently deemed immaterial, that create potential for a material impact on our business. You should carefully consider the risks outlined below, in addition with other information outlined or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. Risks Related to our Business and Industry Weather conditions, including warm winters, dry or warm weather in the harvest season and poor weather in the grilling season, may reduce the demand for propane, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or liquidity. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for heating, agricultural, and recreational grilling purposes. Many of our customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel. Accordingly, our sales volumes of propane are highest during the five-month winter-heating season of November through March and are directly affected by the temperatures during these months. During fiscal 2023, approximately 55 of our propane sales volume was attributable to sales during the winter-heating season. Actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year, which may significantly affect our financial performance or condition. Furthermore, variations in weather in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly affect our total propane sales volume and therefore our financial performance or condition. The agricultural demand for propane is also affected by weather, as dry or warm weather during the harvest season may reduce the demand for propane used in some crop drying applications. Sales from portable tank exchanges experience higher volumes in the spring and summer, which includes the majority of the grilling season. Sustained periods of poor weather, particularly in the grilling season, can negatively affect our portable tank exchange revenues. In addition, poor weather may reduce consumers propensity to purchase and use grills and other propane-fueled appliances thereby reducing demand for portable tank exchange.

 Sudden and sharp increases in wholesale propane prices may not be completely passed on to our customers, especially those with which we have contracted pricing arrangements. These contracted pricing arrangements will adversely affect our profit margins if they are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment and wholesale propane prices do increase. Conversely, sudden and sharp decreases in wholesale propane prices may result in our customers not fulfilling obligations under contracted pricing arrangements entered into with us. Customer defaults under these higher sales price arrangements may adversely affect our profit margins. Gross margin from the retail distribution of propane is primarily based on the cents-per-gallon difference between the sales price we charge our customers and our costs to purchase and deliver propane to our propane distribution locations. Because our profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale supply costs, we will be adversely affected if we cannot pass on increases in the cost of propane to our customers. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. A certain percentage of that exposure is hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. The wholesale propane price per gallon is subject to various market conditions and may fluctuate based on changes in demand, supply and other energy commodity prices. Propane prices tend to partially correlate with crude oil and natural gas prices. Heightened levels of uncertainty related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, may lead to additional economic sanctions by the U.S. and the international community and could further disrupt financial and commodities markets. We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing, storing, transporting and selling of propane. However, sudden and sharp increases in wholesale propane prices cannot be passed on to customers with which we have contracted pricing arrangements. Therefore, we are exposed to the risk of increased wholesale propane prices and reduced profit margins on the percentage of our contractual commitments that are not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. If we were to experience sudden and sharp propane price decreases, our customers may not fulfill their obligations to purchase propane from us at their previously contracted price per gallon, and we may not be able to sell the related hedged or fixed price propane at a profitable sales price per gallon in the then-current pricing environment. We compete with other businesses to attract and retain qualified employees, and labor shortages and increased labor costs could adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business. We compete with other businesses to attract and retain qualified employees and a tight labor market may cause our labor costs to increase. A shortage of qualified employees may require us to enhance wage and benefits packages in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of employees, increase overtime or hire more expensive temporary employees. No assurance can be given that our labor costs will not increase, or that such increases can be recovered through increased prices charged to customers. We are dependent on our principal suppliers, which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation. Through our supply procurement activities, we purchased approximately 57 of our propane from ten suppliers during fiscal 2023. During extended periods of colder-than-normal weather, these suppliers or other suppliers in one or more of the areas in which we operate could temporarily run out of propane, necessitating the transportation of propane by truck, rail car or other means from other areas. If supplies from these sources were interrupted, certain suppliers were to default or difficulties in alternative transportation were to arise, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, our margins could be reduced.

 Our failure or our counterparties failure to perform on obligations under commodity derivative and financial derivative contracts and increased costs associated with such contracts could materially affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations. Volatility in the oil and gas commodities sector for an extended period of time or intense volatility in the near term could impair our or our counterparties ability to meet margin calls, which could cause us or our counterparties to default on commodity and financial derivative contracts. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity or on our ability to procure product at acceptable prices or at all and could increase our costs to procure product. Legislation and rulemaking associated with parties to derivatives transactions may increase our cost of using derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business or may reduce the availability of such instruments or the creditworthiness of derivatives counterparties available to us. While costs imposed directly on us due to regulatory requirements for derivatives such as reporting, recordkeeping and electing the end-user exception from mandatory clearing, are relatively minor, costs imposed upon our counterparties may increase the cost of our doing business in the derivatives markets to the extent such costs are passed on to us. Hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as epidemic diseases or similar public health crises, illnesses or pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Hurricanes and other natural disasters can potentially destroy numerous business structures and homes and, if occurring in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, could disrupt the supply chain for oil and gas products. Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Damage and higher prices caused by hurricanes and other natural disasters could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition due to the impact on the financial condition of our customers. To the extent the frequency or magnitude of significant weather events and natural disasters increases, the resulting increase in disruptions also could have adverse impacts on our business on both the supply and demand side and therefore adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, epidemic diseases or similar public health crises, illnesses or pandemics or the consequences thereof may increase our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations and may have further adverse impacts on U.S. and global economic conditions, including a renewed slowdown in the U.S. economy, which could decrease demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The propane distribution business is highly competitive, and competition may negatively affect our sales volumes and therefore our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. Our profitability is affected by the competition for customers among all of the participants in the propane distribution business. We compete with a number of large national and regional firms and several thousand small independent firms. Because of the relatively low barriers to entry into the propane market, there is the potential for small independent propane distributors, as well as other companies not previously engaged in propane distribution, to compete with us. Some rural electric cooperatives and fuel oil distributors have expanded their businesses to include propane distribution. As a result, we are subject to the risk of additional competition in the future. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or lower costs than we do. Should a competitor attempt to increase market share by reducing prices, our operating margins and customer base may be negatively impacted. Generally, warmer-than-normal weather and increasing wholesale fuel prices further intensify competition. The propane distribution industry is a mature one, which may limit our growth. The propane distribution industry is a mature one. We foresee no growth or a small decline in total national demand for propane in the near future. Year-to-year industry volumes are primarily impacted by fluctuations in temperatures and economic conditions. Our ability to grow our sales volumes within the propane distribution industry is primarily dependent upon our ability to acquire other propane distributors and integrate those acquisitions into our operations and upon the success of our marketing efforts to acquire new customers organically. If we are unable to compete effectively in the propane distribution business, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.

 We may not be successful in making acquisitions, and any acquisitions we make may not result in achievement of our anticipated results. In either case, this failure would potentially limit our growth, limit our ability to compete and impair our results of operations and financial condition. We have historically expanded our business through acquisitions. We regularly consider and evaluate opportunities to acquire propane distributors. We may choose to finance these acquisitions through internal cash flow, external borrowings or the issuance of additional Class A Units or other securities. We have substantial competition for acquisitions, and, although we believe there are numerous potential large and small acquisition candidates in our industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to make any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. There is also a risk we will not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations or achieve any expected cost savings or other synergies. We may also assume or become subject to known or unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and we may not be protected against any such liabilities by indemnification from the sellers or insurance. There is no assurance that any acquisitions made will not be dilutive to our earnings and distributions and that any additional equity we issue as consideration for an acquisition will not be dilutive to our unitholders or any additional debt we incur to finance an acquisition will not affect the operating partnership s ability to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners or service our existing debt. Our operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes and/or market responses to global climate change, including competition from other energy sources in response to such changes. There continues to be concern, both nationally and internationally, about climate change and the contribution of GHG emissions, most notably carbon dioxide, to global warming. Because propane is considered a clean alternative fuel under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, we anticipate that this will provide us with a competitive advantage over other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and coal, as new climate change laws and regulations become effective. At the same time, increased regulation of GHG emissions, especially in the transportation sector, could impose significant additional costs on us, our suppliers and our customers. Numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit GHG emissions. These efforts include cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that limit GHG emissions from certain sources. The impact of new legislation and regulations will depend on a number of factors, including (i) which industry sectors would be impacted, (ii) the timing of required compliance, (iii) the overall GHG emissions cap level, (iv) the allocation of emission allowances to specific sources, and (v) the costs and opportunities associated with compliance. At this time, we cannot predict the effect that climate change regulation may have on our business, financial condition or operations in the future. Furthermore, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as volatility in seasonal temperatures and increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change or demand is impacted by regulations associated with climate change, customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, leading either to increased investment or decreased revenues. Propane competes with other sources of energy, some of which can be less costly for equivalent energy value and which also may become more prevalent in response to climate change regulation and other factors. See Item I. Business Industry for additional information on our competition for customers against suppliers of electricity, natural gas and fuel oil.

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has determined that carbon dioxide and other GHGs are regulated pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In June 2019, the EPA replaced the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy rule. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit D.C. Circuit vacated the Affordable Clean Energy rule and remanded the question to the EPA to consider a new regulatory framework to replace the Affordable Clean Energy rule, thereby allowing the incoming administration to implement standards for emissions from the power sector. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit s decision on the Affordable Clean Energy rule and remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act ). The Inflation Reduction Act contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. These incentives could further accelerate the transition of the U.S. economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives and impact demand for propane. Propane competes with electricity, among other alternative fuels, and to the extent the cost of production and delivery is reduced for electricity and other alternative fuel sources with which we compete, we may experience reduced demand for our propane. The ultimate impact on propane demand and our business is uncertain and may change as implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act moves forward. We cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources and related laws might have on our financial position or results of operations. Economic and political conditions may harm the energy business disproportionately to other industries. Deteriorating regional and global economic and political conditions, including U.S. sanctions on Iran oil exports and conflict, unrest and economic instability in oil producing countries and regions, and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may cause significant disruptions to commerce throughout the world. If those disruptions occur in areas of the world which are tied to the energy industry, such as the Middle East, it is likely that our industry will be either affected first or affected to a greater extent than other industries. These conditions or disruptions may impair our ability to effectively market or acquire propane or impair our ability to raise equity or debt capital for acquisitions, capital expenditures or ongoing operations. We are subject to operating and litigation risks, and related costs or liabilities may not be covered by insurance. We are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling, storing and delivering of combustible liquids such as propane. These operations face an inherent risk of exposure to general liability claims in the event that they result in injury or destruction of property. As a result, we have been, and are likely to be, a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Our insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in our industry or in the energy industry generally may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums. Although we maintain insurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent, we cannot guarantee that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices. A significant increase in motor fuel prices may adversely affect our profits. Motor fuel is a significant operating expense for us in connection with the purchase and delivery of propane to our customers. The price and supply of motor fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events we cannot control, such as geopolitical developments, including impacts from Russian military actions in Ukraine, supply and demand for oil, gas, and refined fuels, actions by oil and gas producers, actions by motor fuel refiners, conflict, unrest or economic instability in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and weather conditions. We may not be able to pass any increases in motor fuel prices on to our customers. As a result, any increases in these prices may adversely affect our profitability and competitiveness.

 If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyber security attacks or other events, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the operation of our information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our business and reputation may suffer, and our internal controls could be adversely affected. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, sabotage, or other disruptions. The efficient execution of our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems, and we depend on our management information systems to process orders, manage inventory, manage accounts receivable collections, maintain distributor and customer information, maintain cost-efficient operations and assist in delivering propane on a timely basis. In addition, our staff of management information systems professionals relies heavily on the support of several key personnel and vendors. Any disruption in the operation of those management information systems, including a cyber-security breach or loss of employees knowledgeable about the operation of such systems, termination of our relationship with one or more of these key vendors or failure to continue to modify and upgrade such systems effectively as our business expands could negatively affect our business, financial condition or reputation. We may incur significant costs in order to comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or other liabilities or costs. There are numerous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of personal data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA limits how we may collect and use personal data, in addition to imposing severe statutory damages and providing consumers with a private right of action for certain data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act CPRA amends and expands the CCPA, providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal data and establishing a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing compliance. Other states, including Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, have enacted similar privacy legislation effective in 2023, with additional states, including Oregon, Texas, and Utah, having enacted similar privacy legislation, which would be effective in the upcoming year. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA and other states data privacy laws are potentially far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. It remains unclear how various provisions will be interpreted and enforced. Data privacy laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident. We or our third-party service providers could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our or our third-party service providers business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our or our third-party service providers business, results of operations or financial condition.

 The conduct of our business may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs and place restrictions on our operations. We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our customers in connection with the conduct of our business. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our management and personnel. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages and to cease making or selling certain products or services. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and negatively affect our business, financial condition, or reputation. We may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or other liabilities or costs. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment or human health and safety. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may increase our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and even the issuance of injunctions that may restrict or prohibit some or all of our operations. Such laws and regulations are subject to change and we cannot provide assurance that the cost of compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements If we are unable to access the financing markets, including through our Credit Facility, it may adversely impact our business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact our ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, there are limitations on our ability to utilize fully all commitments under our Credit Facility. Availability under our Credit Facility is determined by reference to a borrowing base comprised of a combination of accounts receivable and propane inventory that fluctuates over time and the borrowing base may be further reduced by discretionary actions of the administrative agent under the Credit Facility. See Note H Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details. If we are unable to access the financing markets, including through our Credit Facility, we would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and repay outstanding debt. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations and repay or refinance such debt. Our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to satisfy our obligations and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. We have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. See Note H Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for more detail. Our long-term debt obligations do not contain any sinking fund provisions, but require aggregate principal payments, without premium, as disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Material Cash Requirements.

Table of Contents 
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to enter leasing transactions at favorable terms could also be impacted. The Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. For more detail, see Note H Debt and Note I Preferred units to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. The operating partnership has a corporate rating of B1 from Moody s Investors Service Moody s ). Our senior unsecured notes were assigned a B2 rating by Moody s. Any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our debt securities. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the OpCo Notes or other debt securities is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such debt securities without a substantial discount. Restrictive covenants in the Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the agreements governing our other future indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility and ability to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units. The Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment contain important exceptions to these covenants . The Indentures and the Credit Agreement contain, and any agreement that will govern debt incurred by us in the future may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions as described in Note H Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. These covenants also limit the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and therefore effectively limit the ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders. See Note I Preferred units for a discussion of limitations related to distributions. The Indentures and the Credit Agreement contain important exceptions to the covenants, including the covenants that restrict our ability to sell assets and make restricted payments. For example, the Indentures initially permit the operating partnership to make 60 million plus the amount of the operating partnership s Available Cash from Operating Surplus (as defined in the Indentures) for the preceding fiscal quarter (so long as the operating partnership s fixed coverage ratio is at least 1.75x) or 25 million (if the operating partnership s fixed coverage ratio is below 1.75x) plus an additional 25 million, in each case, of restricted payments for any purpose, subject to compliance with applicable conditions, as well as to make additional restricted payments for specified purposes. Furthermore, we may utilize exceptions to sell assets and such asset sales may be on unfavorable terms. The operating partnership issued 700.0 million aggregate initial liquidation preference of Preferred Units, the terms of which restrict us from undertaking certain actions while such Preferred Units are outstanding. The Preferred Units are entitled to quarterly distributions in cash or payment in kind and are redeemable at the option of the operating partnership at any time, or at the option of the holders no earlier than March 30, 2031, subject to the terms as described in more detail under Note I Preferred units to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 For so long as at least 20 of the Preferred Units initially issued (without any adjustment for new Preferred Units issued as payment in kind) remain outstanding, holders of the Preferred Units have the right, voting as a separate class, to designate one director onto the board of the general partner, which may not exceed nine directors. For so long as at least 35.0 million aggregate liquidation preference of Preferred Units remain outstanding, the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership limit certain actions, unless agreed by holders of at least 1/3 of the outstanding Preferred Units. Accordingly, the holders of the Preferred Units will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies. The interests of holders of the Preferred Units may conflict with our interests or the interests of our debtholders or securityholders. Additionally, upon the occurrence of certain change of control transactions, the holders of the Preferred Units will have the option to require the redemption of all or a portion of the Preferred Units in cash in an amount equal to the redemption price; and such a change of control will also trigger a change of control under the Indentures. In the event that no Class B Units are outstanding and the outstanding amount of Preferred Units is greater than 233.3 million after March 30, 2031, to the extent the operating partnership fails to redeem all the outstanding Preferred Units, holders of at least 1/3 of the outstanding Preferred Units will have the right to appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors of the general partner and initiate a sale of the operating partnership. These restrictions may limit our flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. We may be unable to repurchase the OpCo Notes or repay or repurchase other debt or other securities upon a change of control. Upon the occurrence of a change of control under the Indentures, we or a third party will be required to make a change of control offer to repurchase the OpCo Notes at 101 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, a change of control under the Credit Facility constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Credit Agreement and terminate their commitments to lend thereunder. We may not have the financial resources to purchase the OpCo Notes, particularly if a change of control event triggers a similar repurchase requirement for, or results in the acceleration of, other indebtedness, including under our Credit Facility. In addition, the Preferred Units have similar change of control provisions which require us to offer to redeem the Preferred Units at a price equal to the then-current liquidation preference per unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions. These restrictions could prevent us from satisfying our obligations to purchase such securities unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness or obtain waivers or consents from the holders thereof. Our failure to pay the change of control purchase price or repay borrowings when due would allow the holders to declare such indebtedness be immediately due and payable. The exercise by the holders of our indebtedness under the OpCo Notes or the Credit Agreement of their right to require us to repurchase or repay such indebtedness upon a change of control could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness or other securities, including future agreements, even if the change of control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a repurchase or repayment is required at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or repaying such indebtedness, we could attempt to refinance the indebtedness that contains such prohibitions. If we do not obtain a consent or repay such indebtedness, our failure to purchase or repay such indebtedness would constitute an event of default which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to pay cash to the holders of such indebtedness upon a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

 We may not be able to clearly establish when a sale of all or substantially all of the assets has occurred under New York law. One of the events that may constitute a change of control is a sale of all or substantially all our assets. The meaning of substantially all varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and has no clearly established meaning under New York law, which governs the Indentures and the Credit Agreement. This ambiguity as to when a sale of substantially all of our assets has occurred may result in uncertainty regarding whether a change of control has occurred and whether an obligation to offer to repurchase or repay under the Indentures or the Credit Agreement has been triggered. Our Class A Units are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are instead traded on the OTC Pink Market. The OTC Pink Market has less liquidity than the NYSE and unitholders may face limited availability of market quotations for our Class A Units, reduced liquidity for the trading of our Class A Units and potentially lower trading prices for our Class A Units. We expect our Class A Units to be quoted on the OTC Pink Market for the foreseeable future. Unitholders may face limited availability of market quotations for our Class A Units, reduced liquidity for the trading of our Class A Units and potentially lower trading prices for our Class A Units. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future, and it could impair our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees. There can be no assurance that the trading market for our Class A Units will improve in the future or that any improvement will be sustained. There may be no active trading market for our debt securities, which may limit a holder s ability to sell our debt securities. The OpCo Notes are not, and we do not expect any debt securities we may issue in the future to be, listed on any securities exchange quoted through any automated quotation system. An established market for our debt securities may not develop, or if one does develop, it may not be maintained. We cannot assure a debt holder that a liquid market for the debt securities will develop, or that the holder will be able to sell its debt securities or receive a specific price upon any sale of its debt securities. If a public market for our debt securities did develop, the debt securities could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than their principal amount or purchase price, depending on many factors. Subject to certain restrictions, Ferrellgas Partners may dilute existing interests of unitholders by selling additional limited partner interests. Ferrellgas Partners may also dilute existing Class A Units by converting Class B Units to Class A Units. The partnership agreement of Ferrellgas Partners generally allows Ferrellgas Partners to issue additional limited partner interests and other equity securities, subject to consent by holders of the Requisite Class B Units (defined as (a) if the holder that initially holds a majority of the Class B Units (the Initial Class B Majority Holder holds at least 50 of the Class B Units, holders of at least 50 of the outstanding Class B Units or (b) if the Initial Class B Majority Holder holds less than 50 of the Class B Units, holders of at least one-third of the outstanding Class B Units). When Ferrellgas Partners issues additional equity securities, a unitholder s proportionate partnership interest in such class will decrease. Such an issuance could negatively affect the amount of cash distributed to unitholders and the market price of such units. The issuance of additional units will also diminish the relative voting strength of the previously outstanding class of units. In addition, Ferrellgas Partners may issue preferred or other securities that could have a preferred right to distributions or other priority economic terms, which could negatively affect the value of our outstanding units. See Note J Equity (Deficit) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for more information related to the Class B units.

 If Ferrellgas Partners is permitted to make and makes distributions to its partners, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class B Unitholders collectively will receive at least approximately 85.7 of the aggregate amount of each such distribution and may receive up to 100 of any such distribution. Accordingly, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class A Unitholders may not receive any distributions and, in any case, will not receive collectively more than approximately 14.1 of any distribution. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on partnership distributions pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA. For additional discussion of the terms of the Class B Units, see Note J Equity (Deficit) in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Although the general partner has not made any decisions or adopted any policy with respect to the allocation of future distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners, the general partner may determine that it is advisable to pay more than the minimum amount of any distribution, up to 100 of the amount of such distribution, to Class B Unitholders. Risks Arising from Our Partnership Structure and Relationship with Our General Partner Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity and has no material operations or assets, other than its ownership stake in the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. Accordingly, Ferrellgas Partners is dependent on distributions from the operating partnership to service its obligations and pay distributions to its unitholders. These distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to significant limitations. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity for our subsidiaries, including the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners has no material operations and only limited assets. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. is Ferrellgas Partners wholly-owned finance subsidiary, acts only as a co-obligor on its debt securities, if any, conducts no business and has nominal assets. Accordingly, Ferrellgas Partners is dependent on cash distributions from the operating partnership and its subsidiaries to service any obligations of Ferrellgas Partners and pay distributions to its unitholders. Unitholders have limited voting rights; our general partner manages and operates us, thereby generally precluding the participation of our unitholders in operational decisions. Our general partner manages and operates us. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders generally have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. Holders of Ferrellgas Partners Class B Units and the operating partnership s Preferred Units have certain additional voting rights focused on their respective distribution rights or preferences and their respective protective covenants and other rights under the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Amendments to the agreement of limited partnership of Ferrellgas Partners may be proposed only by or with the consent of our general partner. Proposed amendments must generally be approved by holders of at least a majority of Ferrellgas Partners outstanding Class A Units and, in certain cases, holders of Ferrellgas Partners Class B Units and the operating partnership s Preferred Units. Class A Unitholders will have no right to elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner on an annual or other continuing basis. See Note J Equity (Deficit) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for Board rights related to the Class B Units. Under certain circumstances, holders of the Preferred Units may have the right to appoint a majority of the Board of Directors of our general partner after March 30, 2031. See Note I Preferred units to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our general partner may not be removed except pursuant to the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the outstanding units entitled to vote thereon, which includes the Class A Units owned by our general partner and its affiliates and upon the election of a successor general partner by the vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding Class A Units entitled to vote; provided that holders of the Class B Units will have the right to remove the general partner under certain circumstances.

 Unitholders may not have limited liability in specified circumstances and may be liable for the return of distributions. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states. The limited partners could be held liable in some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if it were determined that we had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute. In addition, under some circumstances a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution. Unitholders will not be liable for assessments in addition to their initial capital investment in our Class A Units. Under Delaware law, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution causes all our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which recourse is limited to specific property are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount for three years from the distribution date. Under Delaware law, an assignee that becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership. However, such an assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to that assignee at the time such assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreements. Tax Risks The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS could challenge our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which, if successful, would result in our being treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Additionally, changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity-level taxation. Either of these events would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We believe that, under current law, we have been and will continue to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes; however, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. One of the requirements for such classification is that at least 90 of our gross income for each taxable year has been and will be qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ). Whether we will continue to be classified as a partnership depends in part on our ability to meet this qualifying income test in the future. If we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay tax on our income at corporate rates, currently a maximum of 21 at the federal level, and we would probably pay additional state income taxes as well. In addition, distributions would generally be taxable to the recipient as corporate dividends and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us at the entity level as a corporation, the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders and thus would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of our units. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, may be modified by administrative or judicial interpretation or legislative action at any time. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation, affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and change the character or treatment of portions of our income. Any such changes could cause us to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thereby subject us to entity-level income taxes, which would cause a material reduction in our anticipated cash flows and adversely affect the value of our units.

Table of Contents 
 A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may reduce the market value of our units and the costs of any contest will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from those expressed herein or from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of the positions we take, and some or all of these positions ultimately may not be sustained. Any successful IRS contest may materially reduce the market value of our units and the prices at which our units trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne by us and therefore indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner. Unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they do not receive cash distributions from us. Unitholders may be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, including our taxable income associated with a disposition of property or cancellation of debt, whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. Unless we are able to pay and actually pay cash distributions on our Class A Units, Class A Unitholders will not receive any cash from us to cover any such tax liabilities, and, if we do pay cash distributions in the future, such cash distributions may not be equal to unitholders share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability which results from that income. We continue to pursue a strategy to normalize our capital structure. As part of this strategy, we may engage in transactions that could have significant adverse tax consequences to our unitholders. For example, we may sell some of our assets and use the proceeds to fund capital expenditures or a redemption or conversion of our Class B Units or Preferred Units rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders, and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income and gain resulting from the sale without receiving a cash distribution. We may also engage in transactions to reduce our existing debt or debt service costs, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt, which could result in cancellation of indebtedness income, or other income, being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income. This may cause a unitholder to be allocated taxable income with respect to our units with no corresponding distribution of cash to fund the payment of the unitholder s resulting tax liability. The ultimate effect of any such allocations will depend on the unitholder s individual tax position with respect to its units. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences to them of this income. Our unitholders may be subject to limitations on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us. In general, our Class A Unitholders are entitled to a deduction for the interest we have paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act ), for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the deductibility of net interest expense is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30 (or 50 for 2020, as amended by the CARES Act) of our adjusted taxable income . For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2022, the Tax Act calculates adjusted taxable income using an EBITDA-based calculation. For tax years beginning January 1, 2022 and thereafter, the calculation of adjusted taxable income will not add back depreciation or amortization. Any business interest expense disallowed at the partnership level is then generally carried forward and may be deducted in a succeeding taxable year by a unitholder, in accordance with the unitholder s applicable tax laws. These limitations might cause interest expense to be deducted by our unitholders in a later period than recognized in the GAAP financial statements. There are limits on the deductibility of losses. In the case of unitholders subject to the passive loss rules (generally, individuals, closely held corporations and regulated investment companies), any losses generated by us will only be available to offset our future income and cannot be used to offset income from other activities, including passive activities or investments. Unused losses may be deducted when the unitholder disposes of its entire investment in us in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. A unitholder s share of our net passive income may be offset by unused losses carried over from prior years, but not by losses from other passive activities, including losses from other publicly-traded partnerships.

 Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our Class A Units could be different than expected. If a unitholder sells its Class A Units, the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and its tax basis in those Class A Units. Prior distributions in excess of the total net taxable income the unitholder was allocated for a Class A Unit, which decreased its tax basis in that Class A Unit, will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if the Class A Unit is sold at a price greater than its tax basis in that Class A Unit, even if the price received is less than its original cost. A substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing a gain, will likely be ordinary income to that unitholder. Should the IRS successfully contest certain positions we take, a selling unitholder could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions, without the benefit of decreased taxable income in prior years. In addition, if a unitholder sells its units, the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash that unitholder receives from the sale. Tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning Class A Units that may result in additional tax liability or reporting requirements for them. An investment in Class A Units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans, individual retirement accounts, regulated investment companies, generally known as mutual funds, and non-U.S. persons, raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and thus will be taxable to them. Net income from a qualified publicly-traded partnership is qualifying income for a regulated investment company, or mutual fund. However, no more than 25 of the value of a regulated investment company s total assets may be invested in the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded partnerships. We expect to be treated as a qualified publicly-traded partnership. Distributions, if any, made to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes, at the highest effective tax rate applicable to individuals, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and generally pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Reporting of partnership tax information is complicated and subject to audits; we cannot guarantee conformity to IRS requirements. As a result of investing in our units, a unitholder will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions in which it is not domiciled. Additionally, unitholders may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets. We will furnish each unitholder with a Schedule K-1 that sets forth that unitholder s allocable share of income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing these schedules, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and adopt various depreciation and amortization methods. We cannot guarantee that these schedules will yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. If any of the information on these schedules is successfully challenged by the IRS, the character and amount of items of income, gain, loss or deduction previously reported by unitholders might change, and unitholders might be required to adjust their tax liability for prior years and incur interest and penalties with respect to those adjustments. We may be audited by the IRS and tax adjustments could be made. The rights of a unitholder owning less than a 1 interest in us to participate in the income tax audit process are very limited. Further, any adjustments in our tax returns may lead to adjustments in unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us. A unitholder will bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of its personal tax return. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We will generally have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our general partner and our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.

 In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, such as state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property. A unitholder will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We currently conduct business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It is each unitholder s responsibility to file all required federal, state and local tax returns. If we default on any of our debt, the holders will have the right to sue us for non-payment. That action could cause an investment loss and negative tax consequences for our unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution. Likewise, if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt, our unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution. A unitholder whose Class A Units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a short seller to cover a short sale of Class A Units) may be deemed to have disposed of those Class A Units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those Class A Units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition. Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose Class A Units are the subject of a securities loan may be deemed to have disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those Class A Units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those Class A Units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those Class A Units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their Class A Units. Conflicts of Interest Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of the relationships between us, on the one hand, and our general partner and its affiliates, on the other. The directors and officers of our general partner have fiduciary duties to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to our general partner and its stockholder. At the same time, our general partner has a contractual good faith duty of care to manage us in a manner the general partner reasonably believes to be in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests. The contractual duties of our general partner to us and our unitholders, therefore, may conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors and officers of our general partner to our general partner and its stockholder. Matters in which, and reasons that, such conflicts of interest may arise include: we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of our general partner and its affiliates; under the terms of the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, we must reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for costs incurred in managing and operating us, including costs incurred in providing employees to the operating partnership and rendering corporate staff and support services to us; our general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or causing us to enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities; neither the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership nor any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us, on the one hand, and our general partner and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arm s-length negotiations;

Table of Contents 
 whenever possible, our general partner limits our liability under contractual arrangements to all or a portion of our assets, with the other party thereto having no recourse against our general partner or its assets; the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership permit our general partner to make these limitations even if we could have obtained more favorable terms if our general partner had not limited its liability; any agreements between us and our general partner or its affiliates will not grant to our unitholders, separate and apart from us, the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner or such affiliates in favor of us; therefore, our general partner will be primarily responsible for enforcing those obligations against itself or such affiliates; our general partner may exercise its limited right to call for and purchase Class A Units as provided in the partnership agreement of Ferrellgas Partners or assign that right to one of its affiliates or to us; our partnership agreements provide that it will not constitute a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties to us for its affiliates to engage in activities of the type conducted by us, other than retail propane sales to end users in the continental United States in the manner engaged in by our general partner immediately prior to our initial public offering, even if these activities are in direct competition with us; our general partner and its affiliates have no obligation to present business opportunities to us; our general partner selects the attorneys, accountants and others who perform services for us, and these persons may also perform services for our general partner and its affiliates; however, our general partner is authorized to retain separate counsel for us or our unitholders, depending on the nature of the conflict that arises; and James E. Ferrell was the Chief Executive Officer and President of our general partner and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of our general partner through July 31, 2023. Effective August 1, 2023, Mr. Ferrell is the Executive Chairman of our general partner and the Board of Directors of our general partner. Mr. Ferrell owns other companies with whom we may, from time to time, conduct transactions in the ordinary course of our business. Mr. Ferrell s ownership of these entities may conflict with his duties as an officer or director of our general partner, including with respect to our relationship and conduct of business with any of Mr. Ferrell s companies. 
 Fiduciary Responsibilities Unless otherwise provided for in a partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit the general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest. The partnership agreements of both Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership, as permitted by Delaware law, unconditionally eliminate the default fiduciary duty standards and require the general partner to adhere to the contractual good faith duty of care set forth in those agreements. Specifically, the general partner need only take actions that it, as general partner, reasonably believes to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interest of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Thus, neither the general partner nor Ferrellgas Partners owes traditional fiduciary duties to the unitholders.

 The partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership expressly permit our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest between itself or its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or our unitholders, on the other, and to consider, in resolving such conflicts of interest, the interests of other parties in addition to the interests of our unitholders. In addition, the partnership agreement of Ferrellgas Partners provides that a purchaser of Class A Units is deemed to have consented to specified conflicts of interest and actions of our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise be prohibited, including those described above, and to have agreed that such conflicts of interest and actions do not constitute a breach by our general partner of any duty stated or implied by law or equity. Our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners or the operating partnership or its duties to us or our unitholders if the resolution of such conflict is fair and reasonable to us. Under the partnership agreements, any conflict of interest and any resolution thereof will conclusively be deemed fair and reasonable to us if it is (i) approved by the audit committee of our general partner, or (ii) on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us). The latitude given in the partnership agreements to our general partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a unitholder to challenge what might, in the absence of the partnership agreement provisions eliminating default fiduciary duties be a breach of fiduciary duty. The partnership agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership expressly limit the liability of our general partner by providing that our general partner, its affiliates and their respective officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our unitholders or assignees thereof for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions if our general partner and such other persons acted in good faith. In addition, we are required to indemnify our general partner, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and trustees to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by our general partner or such other persons if our general partner or such persons acted in good faith and in a manner it or they reasonably believed to be in, or (in the case of a person other than our general partner) not opposed to, the best interests of us and, with respect to any criminal proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.

 We typically manage our propane distribution locations using a structure where one location, referred to as a service center, is staffed to provide oversight and management to multiple distribution locations, referred to as service units. At July 31, 2023, our propane distribution locations were comprised of 49 service centers and 803 service units. The service unit locations utilize hand-held computers and cellular or satellite technology to communicate with management typically located in the associated service center. We believe this structure together with our technology platform allows us to more efficiently route and schedule customer deliveries and significantly reduces the need for daily on-site management. We also distributed propane for portable tank exchanges from 127 company-owned distributors and 4 independently-owned distributors at July 31, 2023. In addition, we had 12 company-owned portable tank exchange production facilities at July 31, 2023. We owned approximately 48.4 million gallons of propane storage capacity at our propane distribution locations at July 31, 2023. We owned our land and buildings in the local markets of approximately 64 of our operating locations and leased the remaining facilities on terms customary in the industry at July 31, 2023. We owned approximately 0.8 million propane tanks at July 31, 2023, most of which are located on customer property and rented to those customers. We also owned approximately 4.7 million portable propane cylinders at July 31, 2023, most of which are used by us to deliver propane to our portable tank exchange customers and to deliver propane to our industrial/commercial customers. At July 31, 2023, we leased approximately 42.3 million gallons of propane storage capacity located at underground storage facilities and pipelines at various locations around the United States. At July 31, 2023, we leased 54,691 square feet of office space at our corporate headquarters in the Kansas City metropolitan area. We believe that we have satisfactory title to or valid rights to use all of our material properties. Although some of those properties may be subject to liabilities and leases, liens for taxes not yet currently due and payable and immaterial encumbrances, easements and restrictions, we do not believe that any such burdens will materially interfere with the continued use of such properties in our business. We believe that we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, all required material approvals. These approvals include authorizations, orders, licenses, permits, franchises, consents of, registrations, qualifications and filings with, the various state and local governmental and regulatory authorities which relate to our ownership of properties to our operations.

 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED UNITHOLDER AND STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. Market Information for Ferrellgas Partners Our Class A Units represent limited partner interests in Ferrellgas Partners and are listed and traded on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol FGPR. Any over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. As of August 31, 2023, we had 363 Class A Unitholders of record. That Class A Unitholder figure does not include a substantially greater number of holders who are street name or beneficial holders and whose units are held of record by banks, brokers, and other institutions. Distributions by Ferrellgas Partners We have not paid any cash distributions to Class A Unitholders or the general partner during fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. Ferrellgas Partners made aggregate cash distributions of approximately 49.9 million and 100.0 million to its Class B Unitholders during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For a discussion of considerations related to distributions by Ferrellgas Partners, including the requirements for and limitations on distributions under our partnership agreements and the agreements governing our indebtedness, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities Distributions. Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities There were none during fiscal 2023. Purchases of Equity Securities There were none during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Ferrellgas Partners Tax Matters Ferrellgas Partners is a master limited partnership and thus not subject to federal income taxes. Instead, our Class A and Class B Unitholders are required to report for income tax purposes their allocable share of our income, gains, losses, deductions and credits, regardless of whether we make distributions to our Unitholders. Accordingly, each Unitholder should consult its own tax advisor in analyzing the federal, state, and local tax consequences applicable to its ownership or disposition of our Class A and Class B Units. Ferrellgas Partners reports its tax information on a calendar year basis, while financial reporting is based on a fiscal year ending July 31. Common Equity of Other Registrants There is no established public trading market for the common equity of the operating partnership, Partners Finance Corp. or Finance Corp. Our general partner owns all of the general partner interest, and Ferrellgas Partners owns all of the limited partner interest (other than the limited partner interests represented by the Preferred Units), in the operating partnership. All of the common equity of Partners Finance Corp. is held by Ferrellgas Partners and all of the common equity of Finance Corp. is held by the operating partnership. There are no equity securities of the operating partnership, Partners Finance Corp. or Finance Corp. authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plan. During fiscal 2023, there were no issuances of equity securities of the operating partnership, Partners Finance Corp. or Finance Corp.

Equity Compensation Plan Information None. ITEM 6. RESERVED. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Overview Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, the operating partnership and Partners Finance Corp. Both Partners Finance Corp. and Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Partners Finance Corp. has served as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners, while Finance Corp., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Partners Finance Corp. and Finance Corp. is not presented in this section. The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussions set forth in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there existed one material difference between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership: On January 8, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners entered into a term loan credit agreement with the operating partnership, pursuant to which the operating partnership extended to Ferrellgas Partners an unsecured, non-amortizing term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 19.9 million. The term loan bore interest at a rate of 20 per annum, and all interest on the term loan was added to the outstanding principal amount of the term loan. The term loan was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022. During July 2021, Ferrellgas Partners made an optional prepayment of 9.0 million principal amount of the term loan. On May 16, 2022, Ferrellgas Partners repaid the operating partnership the full amount of the term loan of 15.3 million, which represented the outstanding principal and accrued interest. Additionally, Ferrellgas Partners paid the operating partnership 3.9 million for separate intercompany receivables related to expenses incurred during the 2021 debt transactions.

 How We Evaluate Our Operations We evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on a metric we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA, which is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our revenue generating assets have long useful lives. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the subheading Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Propane operations and related equipment sales Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2023, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the retail distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies. We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. Normal temperatures computed by us are the average of the last 10 years of information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage. Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the winter heating season ). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2023 and 2024 sales commitments and, as of July 31, 2023, we have experienced net mark-to-market gains of approximately 1.1 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets, Other assets, net, Other current liabilities, Other liabilities and Accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales in the consolidated statements of operations as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by decreased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At July 31, 2023, we estimate 93 of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months.

 Summary Discussion of Results of Operations: For the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 We recognized net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of 136.9 million and 148.0 million during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. This change was primarily driven by increases of 56.9 million in Operating expenses personnel, vehicle, plant and other, 18.0 million in General and administrative expense, and 3.5 million in Depreciation and amortization expense. We also recognized a loss of 5.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to a 6.6 million gain in fiscal 2022 in Loss (gain) on disposal of assets. These increases were partially offset by a 79.2 million increase in Gross margin. The increase in gross margin consists of a 69.7 million increase in Gross margin Propane and other gas liquid sales and a 9.5 million increase in Gross margin Other. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased to 254.4 million in fiscal 2023 compared to 226.8 million in fiscal 2022. This increase of 27.6 million was primarily due to a 20.1 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA and a 12.7 million decrease in net cash interest expense, which was partially offset by a 3.2 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures and a 2.0 million decrease in proceeds from asset sales. Distributable cash flow excess increased to 135.0 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to 57.0 million in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a decrease of 49.9 million in distributions paid to Class B unitholders and the 27.6 million increase in distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors noted above.

Table of Contents 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA for Ferrellgas Partners is calculated as net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., plus the sum of the following: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge, loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals, other income, net, severance costs, legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses, business transformation costs, and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership s performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes make it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Equity Investors . Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income taxes, plus proceeds from certain asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of Ferrellgas ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors, including holders of the operating partnership s Preferred Units. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Class A and B Unitholders . Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributions accrued or paid to Preferred Unitholders and distributable cash flow attributable to general partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow Excess . Distributable cash flow excess is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B unitholders minus Distributions paid to Class A and B unitholders. Distributable cash flow excess, if any, is retained to establish reserves, to reduce debt, to fund capital expenditures and for other partnership purposes, and any shortage is funded from previously established reserves, cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Management considers Distributable cash flow excess a meaningful measure of the partnership s ability to effectuate those purposes. Distributable cash flow excess, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow excess that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow excess should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.

 Propane sales volumes during fiscal 2023 decreased 3 , or 22.8 million gallons, compared to fiscal 2022. This decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in retail gallons sold, which correlates with a 3.5 decrease in retail customers. Although temperatures for fiscal 2023 were approximately 5.7 warmer than normal, based on a 10-year average, they were only 0.5 warmer compared to fiscal 2022. Thus, the decrease in gallons sold during fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the decline in retail customers and slightly warmer weather compared to fiscal 2022. Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates to the change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market prices at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas during fiscal 2023 averaged 36 less than fiscal 2022. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged 0.80 and 1.25 per gallon during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged 0.79 and 1.23 per gallon during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. This decrease in the wholesale cost of propane contributed to our decrease in sales price per gallon and therefore revenues. Revenues Retail sales decreased 72.8 million or 5 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in sales price per gallon as noted above. The decrease in revenues from retail customers was primarily in our industrial/commercial, transport and agricultural customer bases. Wholesale sales decreased 23.5 million or 4 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This decrease in sales was primarily due to the decrease in sales price per gallon, as discussed above. Other gas sales decreased 4.7 million or 21 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the decrease in sales price per gallon noted above. Other revenues increased 12.9 million or 13 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to increases in miscellaneous fees billed to customers, tank rental income, and sales of tanks and cylinders. Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales Gross margin increased 69.7 million primarily due to increased retail gross margin of 83.8 million, which was primarily driven by increased margins on sales to residential customers, partially offset by a decrease of 14.2 million in wholesale gross margin. The increase in retail gross margin was primarily due to the decrease in the wholesale cost of propane, as noted above. The decrease in wholesale gross margin was primarily due to an increase in cost of sales attributable to our tank exchange business, which was driven by higher product and transportation costs. Gross margin - other Gross margin increased 9.5 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the increases in Other revenues, as discussed above. Operating income Operating income decreased 11.4 million primarily due to a 74.9 million increase in Operating, general and administrative expense, and a 3.5 million increase in Depreciation and amortization expense. We also recognized a loss of 5.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to a gain of 6.6 million in fiscal 2022 for a net change of 12.3 million in Loss (gain) on assets sales and disposals. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by a 69.7 million increase in Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales and a 9.5 million increase in Gross margin other, both as discussed above.

 Operating, general and administrative expense increased due to a 56.9 million increase in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other, and an 18.0 million increase in General and administrative expense. The increase in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other was driven by increases of approximately 28.8 million in personnel expense from planned increases in compensation across the company and the addition of service technicians in high-growth areas. In addition, the Company had expense of 13.3 million in vehicle repairs, maintenance, and fuel costs due to continued high market costs in these growth areas for fiscal 2023. The remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher claims costs. The increase in General and administrative expense was primarily due to a 13.8 million increase in legal costs associated with a non-core business and 2.1 million of non-recurring costs primarily related to the implementation of an ERP system as part of our business transformation initiatives. The 3.5 million increase in Depreciation and amortization expense was associated with amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, capitalized tank installation costs, and finance leases. The 12.3 million change in Loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals primarily related to the gain associated with the derecognition of a lease liability in fiscal 2022 compared to a loss in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased 20.1 million or 6 primarily due to EBITDA adjustments related to a 13.8 million increase in legal fees and settlements related to a non-core business, the 12.3 million change in Loss (gain) on asset sales and disposals, and 2.1 million of non-recurring business transformation costs related to the implementation of an ERP system in addition to an increase of 3.5 million in Depreciation and amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by the 11.4 million decrease in operating income, as discussed above. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operating activities, our Credit Facility and funds received from sales of debt and equity securities. On March 30, 2021 the operating partnership, the general partner and certain of the operating partnership s subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which provides for a four-year revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 350.0 million. The Credit Agreement includes a sublimit not to exceed 300.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. For additional discussion, see Note H Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. As of July 31, 2023, our total liquidity was 388.3 million, which was comprised of 126.2 million in unrestricted cash and 262.1 million of availability under our Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity and short-term capital resources are intended to fund our working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditures. As of July 31, 2023, letters of credit outstanding totaled 74.0 million. Our access to long-term capital resources, to the extent needed to refinance debt or for other purposes, may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, covenants in our debt agreements and other financial obligations, unforeseen demands on cash, or other events beyond our control. As of July 31, 2023, we had 11.1 million of restricted cash for a cash deposit made with the administrative agent under our prior senior secured credit facility that was terminated in April 2020. Our working capital requirements are subject to, among other things, the price of propane, delays in the collection of receivables, volatility in energy commodity prices, liquidity imposed by insurance providers, downgrades in our credit ratings, decreased trade credit, significant acquisitions, the weather, customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane. Relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements.

 Our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing weather, economic, financial and business conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business, a significant portion of our propane operations and related products cash flows from operations is generated during the winter heating season. Our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts. Historically, we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our propane operations and related equipment sales operations. During periods of high volatility, our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund. Likewise, our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us. We believe that the liquidity available from cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash and the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements for the foreseeable future. Distributable Cash Flow Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is reconciled to net earnings (loss) attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in this Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures above. A comparison of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors to cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors for the year ended July 31, 2023 to the year ended July 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands): 

Distributable Cash reserves Cash distributions cash flow attributable approved by our accrued or paid to DCF to equity investors General Partner equity investors ratio (1) Year ended July 31, 2023 254,364 190,050 64,314 4.0x Year ended July 31, 2022 226,776 161,489 65,287 3.5x Increase (decrease) 27,588 28,561 (973) 0.5x 
 (1) DCF ratio is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors divided by Cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors. 
 For fiscal 2023, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased 27.6 million compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a 20.1 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a 12.7 million decrease in net cash interest expense, partially offset by a 3.2 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures. Quarterly distributions aggregating to 64.4 million were paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units during the year ended July 31, 2023. This included 1.7 million of Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units related to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of July 31, 2023, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 17.5 million with 15.4 million paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units on August 15, 2023. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of 2.1 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters. Quarterly distributions aggregating to 63.4 million were paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units during the year ended July 31, 2022. This included 0.9 million of Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units related to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of July 31, 2022, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 17.5 million with 15.4 million paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units on August 15, 2022. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of 2.1 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to the side letters.

 We did not pay any cash distributions to our Class A Unitholders or the general partner during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Ferrellgas Partners made aggregate cash distributions of approximately 49.9 million and 100.0 million to its Class B Unitholders during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note R Net earnings (loss) per unitholders interest for additional information. Thus, cash reserves, which we utilize to meet future anticipated expenditures, were 190.1 million and 161.5 million, respectively, for the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. Operating Activities Ferrellgas Partners Fiscal 2023 v Fiscal 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities was 212.3 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 160.5 million for fiscal 2022. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a 22.6 million decrease in working capital requirements, an 18.2 million decrease in requirements for other current liabilities, a 14.1 million inflow associated with other assets and liabilities, and a 4.9 million increase in cash flow from operations. These changes were partially offset by an increase of 6.7 million in requirements for prepaid expenses and a 1.3 million increase in accrued interest expense. The 22.6 million decrease in working capital requirements for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a 43.9 million decrease in inventory requirements and a 10.5 million decrease in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, net. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 31.8 million in requirements for accounts payable. The 18.2 decrease in net cash used in operations related to other current liabilities was primarily driven by changes in the broker margin deposit liability. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a 79.2 million increase in gross profit and a 2.4 million decrease in Interest expense. These changes were partially offset by an increase in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other of 56.9 million, an 18.0 million increase in General and administrative expense, and a decrease of 2.2 million in Other income, net. The operating partnership Fiscal 2023 v Fiscal 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities was 212.4 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 179.7 million for fiscal 2022. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a 22.6 million decrease in working capital requirements, an 18.4 million decrease in requirements for other current liabilities, and a 2.6 million increase in cash flow from operations. These changes were partially offset by an increase of 6.7 million in requirements for prepaid expenses, a 2.9 million outflow associated with other assets and liabilities, and a 1.3 million increase in accrued interest expense. The 22.6 million decrease in working capital requirements for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a 43.9 million decrease in inventory requirements and a 10.5 million decrease in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, net. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 31.8 million in requirements for accounts payable. The 18.4 decrease in net cash used in operations related to other current liabilities was primarily driven by changes in the broker margin deposit liability. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a 79.2 million increase in gross profit and a 2.4 million decrease in Interest expense. These changes were partially offset by an increase in Operating expense personnel, vehicle, plant and other of 56.9 million, a 17.9 million increase in General and administrative expense, and a 4.6 million decrease in Other income, net.

 Investing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Capital Requirements Our business requires continual investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for our business consist primarily of: Maintenance capital expenditures. These capital expenditures include expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment, and may from time to time include the purchase of assets that are typically leased, rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures include a routine replacement of a worn-out asset or replacement of major vehicle components; and Growth capital expenditures. These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples include expenditures for purchases of both bulk and portable propane tanks and other equipment to facilitate expansion of our customer base and operating capacity. 
 Fiscal 2023 v Fiscal 2022 Net cash used in investing activities was 110.8 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 111.8 million for fiscal 2022. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 6.3 million decrease in Capital expenditures, partially offset by a 4.4 million increase in Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired and a 0.7 million decrease in Proceeds from sale of assets. Due to the mature nature of our operations we do not anticipate significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures, with the exception of future decisions regarding lease versus buy financing options. However, future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects. The operating partnership The investing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Financing Activities Ferrellgas Partners Fiscal 2023 v Fiscal 2022 Net cash used in financing activities was 122.9 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 171.9 million for fiscal 2022. This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a 50.0 million decrease in fiscal 2023 distributions to Class B unitholders compared to fiscal 2022. The operating partnership Fiscal 2023 v Fiscal 2022 Net cash used in financing activities was 122.9 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 191.1 million for fiscal 2022. This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a 69.2 million decrease in fiscal 2023 distributions to Ferrellgas Partners compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to one distribution being made in fiscal 2023 to Class B unitholders compared to two distributions in fiscal 2022.

 Letters of credit outstanding at July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 totaled 74.0 million and 87.6 million, respectively, and were used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. As of July 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of 262.1 million. Distributions Partnership distributions The Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA requires Ferrellgas Partners to make quarterly cash distributions of all of its available cash . Available cash is defined in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA as, generally, the sum of Ferrellgas Partners cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and net changes in reserves established by our general partner for future requirements. In general, the amount of Ferrellgas Partners available cash depends primarily on whether and the extent to which Ferrellgas Partners receives cash distributions from the operating partnership, as such distributions generally would be Ferrellgas Partners only significant cash receipts. The Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. (the Amended OpCo LPA ), which amended and restated in its entirety the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas L.P., and a First Amendment to the Amended OpCo LPA (the OpCo LPA Amendment ), sets forth the preferences, rights, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Units. Pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, any distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners must be made such that the ratio of (i) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class B Units to (ii) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class A Units and the general partner is not less than 6:1. The Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA permits Ferrellgas Partners, in the general partner s discretion, to make distributions to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio, including paying 100 of any such distribution to Class B Unitholders. The Class B Units will not be convertible into Class A Units until Class B Unitholders receive distributions in the aggregate amount of 357.0 million, which was the 357.0 million aggregate principal amount of Ferrellgas Partners unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2020 (the Ferrellgas Partners Notes ), and the rate at which Class B Units will convert into Class A Units increases annually. Additionally, the price at which Ferrellgas Partners may redeem the Class B Units during the first five years after March 30, 2021 is based on the Class B Unitholders receipt of a specified internal rate of return in respect of their Class B Units. This specified internal rate of return in respect of the Class B Units is 15.85 , but that amount increases under certain circumstances, including if the operating partnership paid distributions on the Preferred Units in-kind rather than in cash for a certain number of quarters. Accordingly, distributing cash to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio could result in the Class B Units becoming convertible into Class A Units more quickly or at a lower conversion rate or reduce the redemption price for the Class B Units. For additional discussion of the terms of the Class B Units, see Note J Equity (Deficit) in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For these reasons, although the general partner has not made any decisions or adopted any policy with respect to the allocation of future distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners, the general partner may determine that it is advisable to pay more than the minimum amount of any distribution, up to 100 of the amount of such distribution, to Class B Unitholders. During fiscal 2023, on April 7, 2023, Ferrellgas Partners made a cash distribution in the aggregate amount of approximately 49.9 million to its Cash B Unitholders. During fiscal 2022, on October 8, 2021 and July 8, 2022, Ferrellgas Partners made cash distributions aggregating in total to approximately 100.0 million entirely to the Class B Unitholders. The aggregate total paid to date to the Class B Unitholders approximates 150.0 million. These distributions to Class B Unitholders were made without making any distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner. See Risk Factors Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements If Ferrellgas Partners is permitted to make and makes distributions to its partners, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class B Unitholders collectively will receive at least approximately 85.7 of the aggregate amount of each such distribution and may receive up to 100 of any such distribution. Accordingly, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class A Unitholders may not receive any distributions and, in any case, will not receive collectively more than approximately 14.1 of any distribution.

 The ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership. For so long as any Preferred Units remain outstanding, the amount of cash that otherwise would be available for distribution by the operating partnership to Ferrellgas Partners will be reduced by the amount of cash distributions and other payments made by the operating partnership in respect of the Preferred Units, including payments to redeem Preferred Units. Further, the indentures governing the 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375 senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes and 825.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and, together with the 2026 Notes, the OpCo Notes ), the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment governing the Preferred Units contain covenants that limit the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and therefore effectively limit the ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders. See Note H Debt and Note I Preferred units for a discussion of these limitations. See also Risk Factors Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements - Our ability to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership, which are limited by our obligations under the Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment and may be limited by a variety of other factors. Accordingly, we may be unable to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units. Preferred unit distributions Pursuant to the OpCo LPA Amendment, the operating partnership is required to pay to the holders of each Preferred Unit a cumulative, quarterly distribution (the Quarterly Distribution at the Distribution Rate (as defined below) on the unit purchase price of such Preferred Unit, which is 1,000 per unit. Distribution Rate means, for the first five years after March 30, 2021, a rate per annum equal to 8.956 , with certain increases in the Distribution Rate on each of the 5th, 6th and 7th anniversaries of March 30, 2021, subject to a maximum rate of 11.125 and certain other adjustments and exceptions. The Quarterly Distribution may be paid in cash or, at the election of the operating partnership in kind through the issuance of additional Preferred Units PIK Units at the quarterly Distribution Rate plus an applicable premium that escalates each year from 75 bps to 300 bps so long as the Preferred Units remain outstanding. In the event the operating partnership fails to make any Quarterly Distribution in cash, such Quarterly Distribution will automatically be paid in PIK Units. The Distribution Rate on the Preferred Units will increase upon violation of certain protective provisions for the benefit of Preferred Unit holders notwithstanding the cap mentioned above. Quarterly distributions aggregating to 64.4 million were paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units during fiscal 2023. This included 1.7 million of Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units related to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of July 31, 2023, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 17.5 million with 15.4 million paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units on August 15, 2023. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of 2.1 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to side letters. Quarterly distributions aggregating to 63.4 million were paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units during fiscal 2022. This included 0.9 million of Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units related to the side letters outlined in the OpCo LPA Amendment. As of July 31, 2022, the Quarterly Distribution accrued was 17.5 million with 15.4 million paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units on August 15, 2022. The remaining Quarterly Distribution accrual of 2.1 million represents Additional Amounts payable to certain holders of Preferred Units pursuant to side letters.

 Preferred unit tax distributions For any quarter in which the operating partnership makes a Quarterly Distribution in PIK Units in lieu of cash, it shall make a subsequent cash tax distribution for such quarter in an amount equal to the (i) the lesser of (x) 25 and (y) the highest combined federal, state and local tax rate applicable for corporations organized in New York, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) one-fourth (1/4th) of the estimated taxable income to be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units for the year in which the Quarterly Tax Payment Date (which refers to certain specified dates that next follow a Quarterly Distribution date on which PIK Units were issued) occurs, over (B) any cash paid on the Quarterly Distribution date immediately preceding the Quarterly Tax Payment Date on which a quarterly tax amount would otherwise be paid (such amount, the Tax Distribution ). Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement. Cash distributions paid On April 7, 2023, Ferrellgas Partners paid cash distributions to holders of the Class B Units in the amount of 38.46 per Class B Unit or approximately 49.9 million in the aggregate for fiscal 2023. On October 8, 2021 and July 8, 2022, Ferrellgas Partners paid cash distributions to holders of the Class B Units in the amount of 38.46 per Class B Unit or approximately 100.0 million in the aggregate for fiscal 2022. The aggregate total paid to date to the Class B Unitholders approximates 150.0 million. For both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, as permitted by the Amended Ferrellgas LPA as described above, Ferrellgas Partners made these distributions solely to Class B Unitholders without any contemporaneous distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner. Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any cash distributions to its Class A or Class B Unitholders during fiscal 2021. The operating partnership paid cash distributions during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 in respect to its Preferred Units as discussed above under Preferred unit distributions. The operating partnership paid cash distributions to Ferrellgas Partners of approximately 50.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2023, which Ferrellgas Partners used to make the April 7, 2023 distribution to Class B Unitholders described above. The operating partnership paid cash distributions to Ferrellgas Partners of approximately 100.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2022, which Ferrellgas Partners used to make the October 8, 2021 and July 8, 2022 distributions to Class B Unitholders described above. The operating partnership The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for distributions by Ferrellgas Partners, fees paid in connection with the Class B Unit exchange and other amounts related to the Ferrellgas Partners Notes, and proceeds received by Ferrellgas Partners pursuant to the term loan credit agreement described below under Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties. Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreements, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled 342.8 million for fiscal 2023, include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf as well as related general and administrative expenses.

 Term loan credit agreement between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership As discussed in Note O Transactions with related parties in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the operating partnership, on January 8, 2021 Ferrellgas Partners entered into a term loan credit agreement with the operating partnership, pursuant to which the operating partnership extended to Ferrellgas Partners an unsecured, non-amortizing term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 19.9 million. The term loan bore interest at a rate of 20 per annum, and all interest on the term loan was added to the outstanding principal amount of the term loan. The term loan was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022. During July 2021, Ferrellgas Partners made an optional prepayment of 9.0 million principal amount of the term loan. On May 16, 2022, Ferrellgas Partners repaid the operating partnership the full amount of the term loan of 15.3 million, which represented the outstanding principal and accrued interest. Additionally, Ferrellgas Partners paid the operating partnership 3.9 million for separate intercompany receivables related to expenses incurred during the 2021 debt transactions.

 Material Cash Requirements The following table summarizes our future material cash requirements as of July 31, 2023: 

Payment or settlement due by fiscal year (in thousands) 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Total Long-term debt, including current portion (1) 2,597 653,839 826,219 1,482,655 Fixed rate interest obligations (2) 83,406 166,812 96,938 48,469 395,625 Operating lease obligations (3) 17,950 25,510 9,632 13,655 66,747 Finance lease obligations (4) 16,655 17,651 1,694 11 36,011 Pension withdrawal liability (5) 284 568 568 2,812 4,232 Product purchase commitments (6) 66,624 66,624 Total 187,516 864,380 935,051 64,947 2,051,894 Underlying product purchase volume commitments (in gallons) 88,132 88,132 

 (1) We have long and short-term payment obligations under agreements such as the indentures governing our senior notes. Amounts shown in the table represent our scheduled future maturities of long-term debt (including current maturities thereof) for the periods indicated. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, see Note H Debt to our consolidated financial statements (2) Fixed rate interest obligations represent the amount of interest due on fixed rate long-term debt. (3) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party operating leases for the periods indicated. (4) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable financing leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party financing leases for the periods indicated. (5) These payments relate to a liability incurred in connection with the withdrawal from certain pension plans. (6) We define a purchase obligation as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for propane and energy commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Our estimated future variable price contract payment obligations are based on the July 31, 2023 market price of the applicable commodity applied to future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. Our estimated future fixed price contract payment obligations are based on the contracted fixed price under each commodity contract. Quantities shown in the table represent our volume commitments and estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated. 
 The components of other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and the fair value of derivatives in connection with our risk management activity. These liabilities are not included in the table above because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount. The operating partnership The cash requirements discussed above also apply to the operating partnership. Adoption of New Accounting Standards Recently adopted accounting pronouncements No new accounting standards were adopted during the year ended July 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted There were no recently issued accounting standards that could have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or notes to the consolidated financial statements upon their adoption. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an on-going basis and discuss the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of our general partner. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. Our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note B Summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. We believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application: Depreciation of property, plant and equipment We calculate depreciation on property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 30 years. Changes in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations. The estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment regarding assumptions about the useful life of the assets being depreciated. When necessary, the depreciable lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis. There were no material revisions to depreciable lives in fiscal 2023. Residual value of customer and storage tanks We use an estimated residual value when calculating depreciation for our customer and bulk storage tanks. Customer and bulk storage tanks are classified as property, plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets. The depreciable basis of these tanks is calculated using the original cost less the residual value. Depreciation is calculated using straight-line method based on the tanks estimated useful life of 30 years. Changes in the estimated residual value could have a material effect on our results. The estimates of the tanks residual value require our judgment of the value of the tanks at the end of their useful life or retirement. When necessary, the tanks residual values are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis. There were no such revisions to residual values in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. Valuation methods, amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names, customer lists and relationships, and non-compete agreements, permits, favorable lease arrangements as well as other intangible assets. The approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. During fiscal 2023 or 2022, we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation methods used for any acquired intangible assets. 
 50 

Table of Contents 
 Our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer-related and contract-based assets representing the rights we own arising from the acquisition of propane distribution companies and related contractual agreements. A customer-related or contract-based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity. We believe that trademarks and trade names have an indefinite useful life due to our intention to utilize all acquired trademarks and trade names indefinitely. When necessary, the intangible assets useful lives are revised and the impact on amortization will be reflected on a prospective basis. The determination of the fair market value of the intangible asset and the estimated useful life are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including (1) the use of widely-accepted valuation approaches, the income approach or the cost approach, (2) the expected use of the asset by the entity, (3) the expected useful life of related assets, (4) any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, including renewal or extension periods that would cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements, (5) the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors and (6) the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows. If the underlying assumption(s) governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed (either favorably or unfavorably), then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life. Such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time. During fiscal 2023 or 2022, we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation method, estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets. Should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired, we may be required to reduce the carrying value and may also be required to reduce the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and any unfavorable change in the useful life (i.e., amortization period) of an intangible asset would increase operating expense at that time. We did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during fiscal 2023. For additional information regarding our intangible assets, see Note B Summary of significant accounting policies and Note G Goodwill and intangible assets, net to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for risk management activities and derivative financial instruments We enter into commodity forward, futures, swaps and options contracts involving propane to hedge exposures to price risk. These derivative contracts are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations or in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of partners capital. We utilize published settlement prices for exchange-traded contracts, quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts. Changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion of derivative commodity and interest rate contracts, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, Note B Summary of significant accounting policies , Note M Fair value measurements and Note N Derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements. We do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts. Litigation accruals and environmental liabilities Our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing for use by consumers of combustible liquids such as propane and, prior to the sales of midstream operations in fiscal 2018, crude oil. As a result, at any given time, we can be threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, and we are a party to several legal proceedings as described in Note P Contingencies and commitments to our audited consolidated financial statements. It is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these matters; however, management is of the opinion that there are no known claims or contingent claims that are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 We are involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present. In accordance with GAAP, we establish reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated. Reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience. These judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary. Such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted. Goodwill impairment We record goodwill as the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill recorded is not deductible for income tax purposes. We have determined that we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. As of July 31, 2023, this reporting unit contains goodwill that is subject to at least an annual goodwill impairment test. In the first step of the test, the carrying value of the reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and intangible assets, to the reporting unit as of the date of evaluation. To the extent a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds it fair value, the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired. The amount of impairment would be equal to the lesser of the excess of reporting unit carrying value over its fair value and the reporting unit s recorded amount of goodwill. Class B Units Our Class B Units are a hybrid financial instrument with an equity host and were measured at fair value at issuance. We utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model and option pricing model to compute an estimated fair value of the Class B Units. This valuation technique required a number of inputs, some of which required an estimate to be made by management. Significant estimates included the forecasted operating results and the forecasted available cash flow available for the paydown of our Class B units. The significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model included the cash flow volatility, equity volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates. We estimated the equity volatility based on the historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group. We estimated the expected term of the Class B Units based on the various conversion or redemption scenarios. The risk-free rate was determined using a U.S. Treasury rate for the period that coincided with the expected term. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We did not enter into any risk management trading activities during fiscal 2023. Our remaining market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading. Commodity price risk management Our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. Our risk management strategy involves taking positions in the forward or financial markets that are equal and opposite to our positions in the physical products market in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change. This risk management strategy is successful when our gains or losses in the physical product markets are offset by our losses or gains in the forward or financial markets. Propane related financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Our risk management activities include the use of financial derivative instruments including, but not limited to, price futures, swaps, options and basis swaps to seek protection from adverse price movements and to minimize potential losses. We enter into these financial derivative instruments with brokers who are clearing members with the Intercontinental Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and, to a lesser extent, directly with third parties in the over-the-counter market. We also enter into forward propane purchase and sales contracts with counterparties. These forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sales exception within GAAP guidance and are therefore not recorded on our financial statements until settled.

 Risk Policy and Sensitivity Analysis Market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy. This policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts. We also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk, so as to manage exposures to changing market prices. We have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options outstanding as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, that were used in our risk management activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities. The potential loss in future earnings from these positions due to a 10 adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at 9.5 million and 20.6 million as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal 10 , thus actual results may differ. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the anticipated transactions associated with these transactions, which we anticipate will be 100 effective. Credit risk We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe significantly reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring counterparties financial condition (including credit ratings), and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit guidelines. Our other counterparties principally consist of major energy companies that are suppliers, marketers, wholesalers, retailers and end users and major U.S. financial institutions. The overall impact due to certain changes in economic, regulatory and other events may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that counterparties may be similarly impacted. Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty performance. Interest Rate Risk At July 31, 2023, we had no variable rate indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates to the extent that we have variable rate indebtedness (including any disbursements or payments related to letters of credit) outstanding under our Credit Facility. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Our consolidated financial statements and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm s Reports thereon listed on the accompanying Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules are hereby incorporated by reference.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. An evaluation was performed by the management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of July 31, 2023. The management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P., and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Based on the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the above mentioned partnerships and corporations have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Therefore, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide such reasonable assurances of achieving our desired control objectives, and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our general partner have concluded, as of July 31, 2023, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in achieving that level of reasonable assurance. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2023. During the most recent fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) or Rule 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. None.

Compensation of our General Partner Our general partner receives no management fee or similar compensation in connection with its management of our business and receives no remuneration other than: (1) distributions on its combined approximate 2 general partner interest in Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership; and (2) reimbursement for: 
 all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred on our behalf; all selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our general partner on our behalf; and all other expenses necessary or appropriate to the conduct of our business and allocable to us. 
 The selling, general and administrative expenses reimbursed include specific employee benefits and incentive plans for the benefit of the executive officers and employees of our general partner. Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires officers and directors of an issuer that has a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of any such class of equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of equity securities of such class with the SEC. These forms include Forms 3, 4 and 5 and any amendments thereto. As result of the delisting of our common units from the NYSE, we no longer have a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and the officers and directors of our general partner and 10 beneficial owners of our Class A Units are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

 However, since the delisting of our common stock, to our knowledge, the officers and directors of our general partner and 10 beneficial owners of our Class A Units generally have continued to file the reports that would be required by Section 16(a) if the Class A Units were registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. To our knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of such Section 16(a) forms and, to the extent applicable, written representations from certain reporting persons that no Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities on Form 5 were required to be filed by those persons, our general partner believes that during fiscal 2023 all Section 16(a) filing requirements that would have been applicable to the officers and directors of our general partner and beneficial owners of more than 10 of our Class A Units (if the Class A Units were registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act) were met in a timely manner. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. Risks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices Management conducted a risk assessment of our compensation policies and practices for fiscal 2023. Based on its evaluation, management does not believe that any such policies or practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Ferrellgas Partners. Overview of Executive Officer Compensation Throughout this section, each person who served as the Principal Executive Officer PEO during fiscal 2023 and the two most highly compensated executive officers other than the PEO serving on July 31, 2023 are referred to as the Named Executive Officers NEOs ). We do not directly employ our NEOs. Rather, we are managed by our general partner who serves as the employer of our NEOs. We reimburse our general partner for all NEO compensation. Named Executive Officers 

 James E. Ferrell, Chief Executive Officer and President; Chairman of the Board of Directors Tamria A. Zertuche, Chief Operating Officer Michael E. Cole, Chief Financial Officer Compensation Objectives We believe an effective executive compensation package should link total compensation to overall financial performance and to the achievement of both short and long term strategic, operational and financial goals. The elements of our compensation program are intended to provide a total rewards package to our NEOs that (i) provides competitive compensation opportunities, (ii) recognizes and rewards individual contribution, (iii) attracts, motivates and retains highly talented executives, and (iv) aligns executive performance toward the creation of sustained unitholder value rather than the achievement of short-term goals that might be inconsistent with the creation of long-term unitholder value. Role of Management Our Chief Executive Officer formulates preliminary compensation recommendations for all NEOs, including himself. These recommendations are subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee. Our Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee utilized market compensation survey data to determine each NEO s compensation. Our compensation philosophy includes benchmarking executive positions using national market data from companies of similar revenue size to us. Data used to compare executive compensation is derived from the compensation survey data obtained from Mercer, LLC. Mercer ), a human resourcing consulting firm, using its United States Mercer benchmark database and the Global Total Compensation Measurement survey provided by Aon Hewitt. Data obtained was used to compare NEOs current base salaries and total direct compensation. Mercer and Aon Hewitt did not provide any formal consulting services.

 Base Salary Our Chief Executive Officer formulates preliminary base salary recommendations for all NEOs, including himself. These recommendations are subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee. To assist our Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee, compensation survey data is utilized to create benchmarks for each NEO s base salary. The Chief Executive Officer and Compensation Committee typically target the market data median value for the purposes of establishing the base salary. Additionally, other factors such as performance and other executive responsibilities are taken into consideration when determining the base salaries of our NEOs. The amount of each NEO s most recent salary during fiscal 2023 is displayed in the table below.

Equity-based Incentive Compensation Plan We have an equity-based incentive compensation plan, the Ferrell Companies Incentive Compensation Plan (the ICP ), in which our NEOs are permitted to participate.

Neither Ferrellgas Partners nor the operating partnership contributes, directly or indirectly, to the ICP.

All awards expire ten years from the date of issuance. Awards granted to NEOs must also be approved by the Compensation Committee. No stock option awards, SARs, performance shares or other incentives payable in cash or in stock were granted under the ICP to NEOs in fiscal 2023 or 2022.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the ESOP ), an employee stock ownership trust purchased all of the outstanding common stock of Ferrell Companies. The purpose of the ESOP is to provide all employees of our general partner, including NEOs, an opportunity for ownership in Ferrell Companies, and indirectly, in us. Ferrell Companies makes contributions to the ESOP, which allows a portion of the shares of Ferrell Companies owned by the ESOP to be allocated to employees accounts over time.

Twice per year and in accordance with the ESOP, each NEO s ESOP account receives an allocation of Ferrell Companies shares. This allocation, as determined by the ESOP, is based on the following: a) the relative percentage of the NEO s base salary, discretionary bonus, and corporate incentive plan payment made during the period to all eligible employee compensation (if applicable), subject to certain limitations under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and b) shares owned from previous allocations.

The 401(k) Plan has a 401(k) feature allowing all eligible employees to specify a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax compensation to be contributed to the 401(k) Plan. It also provides for matching contributions under a cash or deferred arrangement based upon participant salaries and employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan. Due to Internal Revenue Code non-discrimination testing, NEOs are limited to the amount they may contribute to the 401(k) Plan. This testing has historically lowered the annual contribution limit into the 401(k) plan for highly compensated employees, before applying any catch-up contributions for those 50 and older. We will provide a 50 matching contribution of the first 8 of all eligible contributions made to the 401(k) Plan and the SSP (as defined below) combined.

This non-qualified plan is available to all employees who have been designated as Highly Compensated as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. NEOs are allowed to make, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations, pre-tax contributions to the SSP of up to 25 of their eligible compensation.

 Compensation of Non-Employee Directors We believe the compensation package for the non-employee members of the Board of Directors of our general partner should compensate our non-employee directors in a manner that is competitive within the marketplace. Our compensation package includes a combination of annual director fees and SAR awards. Total compensation awarded to our non-employee directors varies depending upon their level of activity within the Board. All directors are paid a base fee, plus additional fees depending on their level of activity. The base fee as of July 31, 2023 was 125,000 per year. Participation in and chairing of committees within the Board will increase the level of compensation paid to an individual Board member. The respective Chairman of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee received an additional 17,500, 11,250, and 11,250, respectively. Our Chief Executive Officer formulates preliminary annual director fee and SAR awards recommendations for each Board member. These recommendations are subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee. To assist our Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee, publicly available board of director compensation data within our industry is reviewed to provide market data that is used to create benchmarks for each director s annual director fee and total compensation package. No SAR awards were granted to our non-employee directors during fiscal 2023. The following table sets forth the compensation of our non-employee directors for fiscal 2023. Mr. Ferrell, who served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of our general partner for fiscal 2023, was also the Chief Executive Officer and President of our general partner for fiscal 2023, and all compensation for his service on the Board of Directors of our general partner is included in the Summary Compensation Table above.

 ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. Related Party Transactions Our written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to our directors, officers and employees. It deals with conflicts of interest, confidential information, use of company assets, business dealings, and other similar topics. The Code prohibits any transaction that raises questions of possible ethical or legal conflict between Ferrellgas interests and an employee s personal interests. The Board of Directors maintains policies that govern specific related party transactions. Each of these policies contains guidelines on what entities or natural persons are considered related parties or an affiliate and the related procedures that are to be followed if transactions occur with these parties. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required by the policies, management provides the Board with a discussion of any related party or affiliate trading transactions. Annually, these policies are reviewed by the Board s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and considered for approval by the Board of Directors. Our directors and officers are required each year to respond to a detailed questionnaire. The questionnaire requires each director and officer to identify every non-Ferrellgas organization of any type of which they or any of their family members (as defined by the SEC) are a director, partner, member, trustee, officer, employee, representative, consultant or significant shareholder. The questionnaire also requires disclosure of any transaction, relationship or arrangement with Ferrellgas. The information obtained from these questionnaires is then evaluated to determine the nature and amount of any transactions or relationships. If significant, the results are provided to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and Board for their use in determining director and officer independence and related party disclosure obligations. We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreement, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled 342.8 million for fiscal 2023, include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf, as well as related general and administrative expenses.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Long-lived assets are tested for impairment, using Ferrellgas best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its assets or asset groups might not be recoverable. The recoverability tests for property, plant and equipment are performed at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The recoverability test is performed by determining the carrying value of the asset group and comparing it to the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset group. The expected future cash flows are estimated based on management s plans. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value and the carrying value of the asset group. reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. As of July 31, 2023, this reporting unit contains goodwill that is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. Under this test, the carrying value of the reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to the reporting unit as of the date of the evaluation on a specific identification basis. To the extent the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired. The amount of impairment would be equal to the lesser of the excess of reporting unit carrying value over its fair value and the reporting unit s recorded amount of goodwill. Ferrellgas completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test on January 31, 2023 and did t incur an impairment loss.

The recoverability tests for definite-lived intangible assets are performed at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The recoverability test is performed by determining the carrying value of the asset group and comparing it to the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset group. The expected future cash flows are estimated based on management s plans.

Revenues from sales of propane are included in Propane and other gas liquids sales on the consolidated statements of operations. Typically, customers are billed upon delivery and payment is generally due within days. With residential customers, Ferrellgas offers customers the ability to spread their annual heating costs over a longer period, typically twelve months. Customers who opt to spread their heating costs over a longer period are referred to as even-pay customers. Ferrellgas charges other amounts to customers associated with the delivery of propane including hazardous materials fees and fuel surcharge fees. In some regions, Ferrellgas also sells appliances and related parts and fittings as well as other retail propane related services. Ferrellgas charges, on an annual basis, tank and equipment rental charges for customers that are using our equipment to store propane. Other revenues associated with deliveries of propane are earned at the time product is delivered. Revenues associated with sales of appliances and other materials or services are earned at the time of delivery or installation. Revenues associated with tank and equipment rentals are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over one year.

 Wholesale - Sales to Resellers Other Gas Sales Other Propane and related equipment revenues Contract assets and liabilities Ferrellgas performance obligations are generally limited to the delivery of propane for its retail and wholesale contracts. Ferrellgas performance obligations with respect to sales of appliances and other materials and other revenues are limited to the delivery of the agreed upon good or service. Ferrellgas does not have material performance obligations that are delivered over time, thus all of its revenue is recognized at the time the goods, including propane, are delivered or installed. Ferrellgas offers even pay and other billing programs that can create customer deposits or advances, depending on whether Ferrellgas has delivered more propane than the customer has paid for or whether the customer has paid for more propane than what has been delivered. Revenue is recognized from these customer deposits or advances to customers at the time product is delivered. The advance or deposit is considered to be a contract asset or liability. Additionally, from time to time, we have customers that pay in advance for goods or services, and such amounts result in contract liabilities. Ferrellgas incurs incremental commissions directly related to the acquisition or renewal of customer contracts. The commissions are calculated and paid based upon the number of gallons sold to the acquired or renewed customer. The total amount of commissions that we incur is not material, and the commissions are expensed commensurate with the deliveries to which they relate; therefore, we do not capitalize these costs. The following table presents the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and contract liabilities: Contract liabilities Deferred revenue (1) 
 (1) Of the beginning balance of deferred revenue, million was recognized as revenue during the year ended July 31, 2023. 
 Remaining performance obligations Ferrellgas remaining performance obligations are generally limited to situations where customers have remitted payment but have not yet received deliveries of propane. This most commonly occurs in even pay billing programs and Ferrellgas expects that these balances will be recognized within a year or less as the customer takes delivery of propane.

There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 during the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. Other financial instruments The carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. At July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Ferrellgas long-term debt instruments was million and million, respectively. Ferrellgas estimates the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices. The fair value of Ferrellgas consolidated debt obligations is a Level 2 valuation based on the observable inputs used for similar liabilities. Ferrellgas has other financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable which could expose it to concentrations of credit risk. The credit risk from trade accounts receivable is limited because of a large customer base which extends across many different U.S. markets.

Ferrellgas maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that it believes reduces its overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring counterparties financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits.

 former officers Rios and Gamboa ), in a lawsuit (the EDPA Lawsuit filed by Eddystone Rail Company Eddystone on February 2, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the Court ). On December 10, 2021, the Court dismissed Eddystone s claims against Rios and Gamboa, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Eddystone. Eddystone indicated that it has prevailed in or settled an arbitration against Jamex Transfer Services JTS ), previously named Bridger Transfer Services, a former subsidiary of Bridger. The arbitration involved a claim against JTS for money due for deficiency payments under a contract for the use of an Eddystone facility used to offload crude from rail onto barges. Eddystone alleges that Ferrellgas transferred assets out of JTS prior to the sale of the membership interest in JTS to Jamex Transfer Holdings, and that those transfers should be avoided so that the assets can be used to satisfy the amount owed by JTS to Eddystone as a result of the arbitration. Eddystone also alleges that JTS was an alter ego of Bridger and Ferrellgas and that Bridger and Ferrellgas breached both an implicit contract as well as fiduciary duties allegedly owed to Eddystone as a creditor of JTS. Ferrellgas believes that Ferrellgas and Bridger have valid defenses to these claims and to Eddystone s primary claim against JTS for breach of contract. If Eddystone ultimately prevails, however, Ferrellgas believes that the amount of damages awarded could be material to Ferrellgas. Ferrellgas intends to vigorously defend this claim. The Court decided summary judgment motions in March 2022 and the segments of the bench trial were completed in September 2022, December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. The Court set a briefing schedule through May 2023 and closing arguments for August 2023. Management does not currently believe a loss is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. However, we may enter into settlement discussions at any time. Long-term debt-related commitments Ferrellgas has long and short-term payment obligations under agreements such as the indentures governing our senior notes.

Ferrellgas assumes all liabilities, which include specific liabilities related to the following employee benefit plans for the benefit of the officers and employees of the general partner. Ferrell Companies makes contributions to the employee stock ownership trust (the Trust ), which causes a portion of the shares of Ferrell Companies owned by the Trust to be allocated to employees accounts over time. The allocation of Ferrell Companies shares to employee accounts causes a non-cash compensation charge to be incurred by Ferrellgas, equivalent to the fair value of such shares allocated. This non-cash compensation charge is reported separately in Ferrellgas consolidated statements of operations and thus is excluded from operating and general and administrative expenses. The non-cash compensation charges were million, million and million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ferrellgas is not obligated to fund or make contributions to the Trust.

For any periods in which earnings are recognized, the earnings will be allocated between the Class B Units and the Class A Units on a -to-one basis. For any periods in which losses are recognized, no effect is given to the Class B Units as they do not contractually participate in the losses of Ferrellgas. In addition, Ferrellgas has the option to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Class B Units outstanding at any time on or prior to March 30, 2026 for cash. This call option does not impact the dilutive effect of net loss per Class A Unit due to the cash-only redemption provision, which is assumed, and therefore there would be no dilutive effect.

The Executive and the Company are each referred to as a Party and collectively the Parties. WHEREAS, the Company wishes to obtain reasonable protection of its confidential business, trade secret, and technical information which it has developed, acquired and/or is or may be developed or acquired by the Company at substantial expenses; and WHEREAS, the Company wishes to obtain reasonable protection against unfair competition and solicitation during the Executive s employment by the Company and following termination of the Executive s employment by the Company and to further protect against unfair use of its confidential business and technical information the Company desires to have Executive execute this Agreement; and WHEREAS, the Executive is willing to execute this Restrictive Covenants Agreement and grant the Company the benefits of the restrictive covenants contained herein. For and in consideration of the continued employment of Executive as President and Chief Executive Officer, and for the promises outlined herein and in Executive s Employment Agreement, Executive agrees as follows: 
 12 

1. Confidential Information . 
 (a) Confidential Information . Executive acknowledges that the continued success of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (as those terms are defined in Executive s Employment Agreement) depends upon the use and protection of a large body of confidential, trade secret, and proprietary information. All of such confidential, trade secret, and proprietary information now existing or to be developed in the future will be referred to in this Restrictive Covenants Agreement as Confidential Information. Confidential Information means all information that is (i) related to the Company s or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates current or potential business and (ii) is not generally or publicly known. Confidential Information includes, without specific limitation, the information, observations, and data obtained by Executive from the performance of Executive s duties to the Company and Subsidiaries and its Affiliates concerning the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates; information concerning acquisition opportunities in or reasonably related to the Company s or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates business or industry of which Executive becomes aware during employment; the development, transition and transformation plans of doing business, strategic, marketing and expansion plans, including plans regarding planned and potential sales, financial and business plans, employee lists and telephone numbers, locations of sales representatives, new and existing programs and services, prices and terms, customer service, integration processes, requirements and costs of providing service, support, and equipment. Accordingly, Executive agrees that, either during or after employment with the Company, Executive shall not disclose to any unauthorized Person or use for Executive s or any Person s own account any Confidential Information without the Board s prior written consent, unless and to the extent that any Confidential Information (i) is or becomes generally available for use by the public other than as a result of Executive s acts or omissions to act in breach of this Restrictive Covenants Agreement or the Employment Agreement; (ii) is or becomes known or available to Executive on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) that, to the Executive s knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, (iii) is or was independently developed by Executive without violation of any obligation under this Restrictive Covenants Agreement or the Employment Agreement, or (iv) is required to be disclosed pursuant to any applicable law or court order (in which case Executive shall give prior written notice to the Company of such required disclosure and shall cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates in any reasonable efforts to limit such disclosure or preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information). Executive agrees to deliver to the Company at the end of her employment, or at any other time the Company may request in writing, all memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, and other property or documents (and copies thereof) relating to the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, without limitation, all Confidential Information) that Executive may then possess or have under Executive s control. 
 (b) Permitted Governmental Disclosures . The federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 immunizes Executives against criminal and civil liability under federal or state trade secret laws under certain circumstances if Executive discloses a trade secret for the purpose of reporting a suspected violation of law. Pursuant to such Act, immunity is available if Executive discloses a trade secret in either of these two circumstances: (1) Executive discloses the trade secret (a) in confidence, (b) directly or indirectly to a government official (federal, state or local) or to a lawyer, (c) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a legal proceeding, Executive discloses the trade secret in the complaint or other documents filed in the case, so long as the document is filed under seal (meaning that it is not accessible to the public). Further, nothing in this Employment Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress, and any federal Inspector General, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Executive does not need prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and is not required to notify the Company or the Board that she has made such reports or disclosures. 

 13 

(c) Third Party Information . Executive understands that the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates will receive from third parties confidential or proprietary information Third Party Information subject to a duty on the Company s and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. During employment and thereafter, and without in any way limiting the provisions of Section 1(a) above, Executive shall hold Third Party Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than personnel of the Company or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who need to know such information in connection with their work for the Company or such Subsidiaries and Affiliates) or use, except in connection with Executive s work for the Company or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, Third Party Information unless expressly authorized by a member of the Board in writing. 
 (d) Return of Company Property . Upon termination of the Executive s employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, voluntarily or involuntarily, and at any time as the Company requests, Executive will deliver to the person designated by the Company all originals and copies of all documents or materials relating to the business of the Company or its Affiliates and other Company property in Executive s possession or control, including but not limited to drawings, specifications, documents (including electronic documents), notes, memoranda, records, devices, models or any other material and copies or reproductions thereof, and any computers, equipment, keys or similar property of the Company. Further, upon request, Executive will certify that Executive has not retained or transferred outside the Company any Confidential Information and/or that Executive has deleted any electronic information belonging to the Company from Executive s personal computers, hard drives, cloud accounts, servers and/or accounts. 
 2. Intellectual Property, Inventions, and Patents . 
 Executive acknowledges that all discoveries, concepts, ideas, inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, patent applications, copyrightable work, all registrations or applications related thereto, all other proprietary information and all similar or related information (whether or not patentable) which relate to the Company s or any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates actual or anticipated business, research, and development or existing or future products or services and which are conceived, developed, or made by Executive (whether alone or jointly with others) while employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries, Work Product ), belong to the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate.

 The waiver by the Company of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Executive shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Executive, and the failure of the Company to take action against any other Executive(s) for similar breach(es) on their part, shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach by Executive. 6. Agreement Binding . 
 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company, and the heirs, executors, and administrators of Executive. The Company shall have the right to transfer and assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to any third party.
