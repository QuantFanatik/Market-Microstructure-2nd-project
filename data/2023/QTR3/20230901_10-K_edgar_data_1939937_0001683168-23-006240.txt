The business model of our Company is deploying new technologies and trying to use innovations to reduce costs, gain competitive advantages
to significantly affect the overcoming the inertia of developing economies. The relatively small costs for starting our business, ease

to continue operations. 

We expect we will require additional capital to
meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt
securities.

As of May 31, 2023, our total assets were 37,044
comprised of cash and cash equivalents of 7,855, Intangible(net) of 19,203 and equipment(net) of 9,986; our total liabilities were
 66,132 comprised of accrued expenses 610, advance from our director of 3,000,

of issuance of common stock of 500, proceeds from note payable of 10,000 and increase in relevant accrued interest of 333. 

PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 

We expect that working capital requirements will
continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements
are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 

Existing working capital, further advances and
debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines
of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement
of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses
and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and
(iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we
expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of
equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights,
preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors
or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 

PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 

W e do not intend to
purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not
have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors.

GOING CONCERN 

The independent auditors' reports accompanying
our May 31, 2023 and 2022 financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

Bolko Company 
 Accounting and Auditing Firm 

1825 NW Corporate Blvd, 110 

Boca Raton,
Florida 33431 

To the Shareholders and Board of
Directors Lamy 

We have audited the accompanying financial
statements of LAMY Company ), which comprise of balance sheet as of May 31, 2023, and the related statement of operations,
stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flow for the period then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. We were not engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity s preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Lamy will continue as going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Lamy has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

The Company
has approximately of net operating losses NOL carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years
which expire in fiscal 2041. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs
for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
