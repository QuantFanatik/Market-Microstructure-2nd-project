Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, potential, intend, expect, seek, anticipate, estimate, believe, could, project, predict, continue, future or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and are based on certain assumptions, discuss future expectations, describe plans and strategies, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. Such statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to our ability to deploy capital quickly and successfully, our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, our reliance on TriLinc Advisors, LLC, or the Advisor, and TriLinc Global, LLC, or the Sponsor, strategies and investment activities and our ability to effectively deploy capital. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our actual results and performance could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements and you should not unduly rely on these statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: 

our future operating results; 

our ability to purchase or make investments in a timely manner; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our borrowers; 

the impact of public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and actions taken to prevent their spread on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net asset value per unit; 

the economic, social and/or environmental impact of the investments that we expect to make; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

our ability to make distributions to our unitholders; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the companies in which we invest; 

the availability of cash flow from operating activities for distributions and payment of operating expenses; 

the performance of our Advisor, our sub-advisors and our Sponsor; 

our dependence on our Advisor and our dependence on and the availability of the financial resources of our Sponsor; 

the ability of our borrowers to make required payments; 

our Advisor s ability to attract and retain sufficient personnel to support our growth and operations; 

the lack of a public trading market for our units; 

the outcome and costs associated with our ongoing legal proceedings related to the recovery of amounts with respect to certain of our Watch List investments; 

our ability to borrow funds; 

our expected financings and investments; 

the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 

performance of our investments relative to our expectations and the impact on our actual return on invested equity, as well as the cash provided by these investments; 

any failure in our Advisor s or sub-advisors due diligence to identify all relevant facts in our underwriting process or otherwise; 

the ability of our sub-advisors and borrowers to achieve their objectives; 

the effectiveness of our portfolio management techniques and strategies; 

failure to maintain effective internal controls; and

Table of Contents 

The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof and we are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results. 
 
 Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects are set forth in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") including the Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page 17. The risk factors set forth in our filings with the SEC could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement contained in this report. 
 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in units of our common stock involves significant risks. See Risk Factors beginning on page 17. These risks include, among others: 

We may not achieve investment results that will allow us to make distributions at a specified level of cash distributions or at all and we may reduce the amount of per unit distributions from time to time. 

We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. 

We may pay distributions from any source, including offering proceeds and, subject to certain limitations, borrowings, and we may choose to pay distributions from such other sources when we do not have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund such distributions. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use to fund distributions. From time to time during our operational stage, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we fund distributions from borrowings or other sources in excess of cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for the investments, and our unitholders overall return may be reduced. 

Our success will be dependent on the performance of our Advisor, including, without limitation, our Advisor's ability to successfully select and oversee sub-advisors. 

We are dependent upon our key management personnel and the key management personnel of our Advisor and affiliates, who will face conflicts of interest relating to time management, and on the continued operations of our Advisor, for our future success. 

We have made and intend to continue to make non-U.S. investments which involve certain legal, geopolitical, investment, repatriation, and transparency risks not typically associated with U.S. investments. 

We have paid substantial compensation to our Advisor and its affiliates. The compensation we pay to the Advisor and its affiliates may be increased by our independent managers. This compensation was not determined on an arm s-length basis and therefore may not be on the same terms we could achieve from a third party. 

Our units will not be listed on an exchange for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, it will be difficult for our unitholders to sell their units and, if they are able to sell their units, it likely will be at a substantial discount. 

Our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, which makes investment in our units more speculative. 

Our success will be dependent on the performance of our sub-advisors and our sub-advisors failure to identify and make investments that meet our investment criteria or perform their responsibilities under the sub-advisory agreements may adversely affect our ability to realize our investment objectives. 

Small and medium-sized businesses may have limited financial resources and may not be able to repay the loans we make to them. 

Lack of minimum requirements when lending to small and medium-sized businesses could increase the risk of default. 

Our unitholders will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their units equal to the offering costs associated with their units.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed on April 30, 2012. Unless otherwise noted, the terms we, us, our, the Company, Trilinc, and our Company refer to TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC; the terms our Advisor and TriLinc Advisors refer to TriLinc Advisors, LLC, our external advisor; the term SC Distributors, formally known as StratCap Securities, and our dealer manager refers to SC Distributors, LLC, our dealer manager; and the term our Sponsor refers to TriLinc Global, LLC, our sponsor. 
 
 Overview 
 
 The Company makes impact investments in Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs, which we define as those businesses having less than 500 employees, primarily in developing economies that provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. To a lesser extent, we may also make impact investments in companies that may not meet our technical definition of SMEs due to a larger number of employees but that also provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. We generally expect that such investments will have similar investment characteristics as SMEs as defined by us. We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company on April 30, 2012. We believe that we operate and intend to operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We invest in SMEs through local market sub-advisors and our objective is to build a diversified portfolio of financial assets, including direct loans, loan participations, convertible debt instruments, trade finance, structured credit and preferred and common equity investments. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our assets will continue to consist of collateralized private debt instruments, which we believe offer opportunities for competitive risk-adjusted returns through income generation. We are externally managed and advised by TriLinc Advisors. 
 
 To assist the Company in achieving its investment objective, the Company makes investments via wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the Company ha s 17 subs idiaries, all of which are Cayman Islands exempted companies. To assist the Advisor in managing the Company and its subsidiaries, the Advisor may provide services via TriLinc Advisors International, Ltd. TAI ), a Cayman Islands exempted company that is wholly owned by TriLinc Advisors, LLC. 
 
 Our business strategy is to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and/or environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs, primarily in developing economies, defined as countries with national income classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income and below. Our style of investment is referred to as impact investing, which J.P. Morgan Global Research and Rockefeller Foundation in a 2010 report called an emerging alternative asset class and defined as investing with the intent to create positive impact beyond financial return. We believe it is possible to generate competitive financial returns while creating positive, measurable impact. Through our investments in SMEs, we intend to enable job creation and stimulate economic growth. 
 
 Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation and modest capital appreciation. These objectives are achieved primarily through SME trade finance and term loan financing, while employing rigorous risk mitigation and due diligence practices, and transparently measuring and reporting the economic, social and environmental impacts of our investments. The majority of our investments are senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans, and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we expect to provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from 5-20 million per transaction for direct SME loans and 500,000 to 15 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets which have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing best practices in our due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Our goal is to create a diversified portfolio of primarily private debt instruments, including trade finance and term loans, whose counterparties are small and medium-size businesses in developing economies. Private debt facilities generate current income and in some cases offer the potential for modest capital appreciation, while maintaining a higher place in a company s capital structure than the equity held by the owners and other investors. As small and growing businesses, our borrowers have used and we expect them to continue to use capital to expand operations, improve the financial standing of their operations, or finance the trade of their goods. According to the most recent IFC SME Banking Guide, SMEs have been shown to improve job creation and GDP growth throughout the world, and we expect the portfolio of our investments to have a positive, measurable impact in their communities, in addition to offering a competitive financial return to the investor. 
 
 On February 25, 2013, our registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC. Pursuant to the registration statement, we commenced our initial public offering of up to 1.5 billion in units of our limited liability company interest, consisting of up to 1.25 billion of units in our primary offering, consisting of Class A units and Class C units at the initial offering prices of 10.00 per unit and 9.576 per unit, respectively, and Class I units at 9.025 per unit, which we refer to as the primary offering, and up to 250 million of units pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, which we refer to as the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, and which we collectively refer to as the Offering. In May 2012, the Advisor purchased 22,161 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of 200,000. In June 2013, we satisfied our minimum offering requirement of 2,000,000 when the Sponsor purchased 321,330 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of 2,900,000 and we commenced operations. The Offering terminated on March 31, 2017. Through the termination of the Offering, we raised approximately 361,776,000 in gross proceeds, including approximately 13,338,000 raised through the Distribution Reinvestment Plan.

Upon termination of the Offering, we registered 75 million in Class A, Class C and Class I units to continue to be offered pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan to the investors who have purchased units in the Offering. On March 7, 2018, our board of managers approved an amendment to our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which, commencing with distributions declared for the month of March 2018, units issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan are being offered at the price equal to the net asset value per unit of each class of units, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of reinvestment. Prior to March 30, 2018, units were issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan at a price equal to the greater of 9.025 per unit or the net asset value per unit of each class, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC.

 Our Advisor 
 
 TriLinc Advisors manages our investments. TriLinc Advisors is a private investment advisory firm focusing on impact investments in SMEs around the world. TriLinc Advisors is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. Led by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gloria Nelund, its President, Brent VanNorman, its Chief Financial Officer, Mark Tipton, its Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, Scott Hall, and its Chief Investment Officer, Paul Sanford, TriLinc Advisors management team has a long track record and broad experience in the management of regulated, multi-billion dollar fund complexes and global macro portfolio management. TriLinc Advisors and our sub-advisors have an extensive network of relationships with emerging market private equity and debt managers, bilateral and multilateral Development Financial Institutions, or DFIs, and international consultancies and service providers that we believe benefit our portfolio of investments. We benefit from both the top-down, global macro investing approach of TriLinc Advisors and the bottom-up deal sourcing and structuring of our sub-advisors. 
 
 We seek to capitalize on the significant investment experience of our Advisor s management team, which has over 130 years of collective experience in financial services and investment. Our CEO, Gloria Nelund, founded our Sponsor in 2008 after a thirty year career in the international asset management industry. 
 
 As of the date of filing of this report, we had engagements, through our Advisor, with nine third-party investment man agers in a sub-advisory capacity to source, evaluate, and monitor investments. We have determined not to make any further investments with five of these sub-advisors, as described below. Our local market sub-advisors have significant experience and established networks in our targeted asset classes, regions and countries, and adhere to the investment parameters as directed by the Advisor s investment team and our board of managers. Primary sub-advisors, who will source the majority of our investments, must have a minimum five year investment track record and have invested at least 250 million in their target region. Secondary sub-advisors, who focus on a specific region or asset class, must have a minimum three year investment track record and have invested at least 100 million in their target region. All sub-advisors must have continuity in their investment team, including senior management, and an investment strategy that can responsibly deploy appropriate levels of capital. Sub-advisors must have strong, independent risk controls and must screen for and track impact and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices of the borrowers.

Africa Global Trade Finance Ltd. AGTF , formerly AMC Trade Finance Ltd., or AMCTF ): AGTF was established in 2016 by Africa Merchant Capital Group, a U.K.-based boutique merchant banking services business founded in 2012 in order to implement its middle market trade finance strategy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The global regulatory environment has reduced commercial banks appetite to deploy funds into the African trade finance market, and non-banking sectors have insufficient capital resources, leaving the SME sector underfunded. AGTF aims to increase the availability of trade finance for domestic and regional trade in Sub-Saharan Africa through offering a range of flexible short-term trade finance product solutions. The AGTF product range includes off-balance sheet stand-alone transactional facilities, back-to-back Letter of Credit facilities, trade-receivable discounting, supplier cash payments and documentary collections. AGTF s principals have more than 150 years of combined experience in banking, corporate finance, trade finance, and emerging markets and have completed more than 1.1 billion in trade finance transactions. TriLinc s partnership with AGTF provides short-term trade finance to borrowers trading into or out of select countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the demand of target borrower companies in the region, and helping them achieve sustainable growth through more flexible financing options. AGTF serves as a secondary sub-advisor. AMCTF s name was changed to AGTF in December 2021, when Zebu Investment Partners, through its African Food Security LP, completed an equity buyout of the founders. As a result of the buyout, Africa Merchant Capital Group no longer has any interest in or relationship to AGTF.

Investment Strategy 
 
 The Company seeks to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs. Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation, and modest capital appreciation. We intend to meet our investment objectives through: 

Investing primarily in SME trade finance and term loans 

A rigorous multi-level risk mitigation strategy at the portfolio level through extreme diversification, the sub-advisor level through rigorous due diligence and oversight, and the investment level through local market knowledge and credit expertise of our sub-advisors 

Equity warrants and discounted trade receivables 

The majority of our investments have been and will continue to be senior secured trade finance, senior secured loans and other collateralized loans or loan participations to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. With our sub-advisors, we provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from 5-20 million per transaction for direct SME loans and 500,000 to 15 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets who have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing sound due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Investments have been and will continue to be primarily credit facilities to developing economy SMEs, including trade finance and SME term loans, through TriLinc Advisors team of professional sub-advisors with a local presence in the markets where they invest. We typically provide financing that is collateralized, has a short to medium-term maturity and is self-liquidating through the repayment of principal. By providing additional liquidity to growing small businesses, we believe we will support both economic growth and the expansion of the global middle class.

The Company believes that the traditional industrial classification systems, including SIC codes, do not accurately reflect the sustainable nature of certain of the Company s investments and, in some cases, may be misleading. Therefore, the Company uses a Company-created industry classification system for presentation of its investments, which the Company believes is more appropriate in light of the sustainable nature of the Company s investments.

 All of the Company s investments in Argentina are Participations in trade finance facilities originated by IIG Trade Opportunities Fund B.V. IIG TOF B.V. ), a subsidiary of a fund advised by one of the Company s former sub-advisors, The International Investment Group L.L.C. IIG ). See the Watch List Investments section in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information. 

As of December 31, 2022, our largest investment represented approximate ly 13.8 of our net assets or 14.2 of our total portfolio. 
 
 As of December 31, 2021 , our largest investment represented approximately 9.7 of our net assets or 10.9 o f our total portfolio. 
 
 Measuring Impact 
 
 We measure and expect to regularly provide accounting of economic, social and/or environmental impact achieved through our investments. The Company s impact measurement system is utilized with investments to evaluate the progress of borrower companies toward their impact objectives during the life of the investment. The system leverages technology that has been specifically developed for tracking and analyzing impact and includes full integration of the Global Impact Investing Network s Impact Reporting and Investment Standards IRIS metrics. Impact measurement is accomplished through the establishment of initial baseline measurements for both the Company core economic development metrics, as well as metrics associated with borrower companies stated impact objectives. These baseline measurements will be compared against future measurements in order to track incremental progress. In addition to furthering the Company s economic development impact objectives, we anticipate that our investments will have a positive effect on borrower companies ability to make progress toward their stated impact objectives(s).

Table of Contents 

On an annual basis, an updated impact assessment is completed. This includes collection of our core impact metrics and borrower company impact objective-spec ific metrics. In June 2023, the Company published its 2022 Sustainability and Impact Report as of December 31, 2022 on its public website. For the Company's 2022 Sustainability and Impact report, the Company also requested an i ndependent review of certain impact data therein. 
 
 Financing Strategy 
 
 We may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our unitholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings from either commercial financial institutions or DFIs. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. In determining whether to borrow money, we will seek to optimize maturity, covenant packages and rate structures. Most importantly, the risks of borrowing within the context of our investment outlook and the impact on our investment portfolio will be extensively analyzed in making this determination. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had borrowings amounting to 16,985,091 and 5,000,000 , net of unamortized issuance costs, respe ctively. If we are not able to obtain additional financings, our returns are expected to be lower than originally anticipated when we were formed. 
 
 Hedging Activities 
 
 Most of our investments are anticipated to continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars, but when exposed to foreign currencies, we will seek to hedge the exposure when prudent and cost-effective. These hedging activities may include the use of derivatives, swaps, or other financial products to hedge our interest rate or currency risk. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of our investments were denominated in U.S. Dollars and we had not entered into any hedging transactions. 
 
 Investment Advisory Agreements and Fees 
 
 We have agreed to pay TriLinc Advisors an asset management fee and an incentive fee for its services under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated February 14, 2018, by and between the Company and the Advisor, as renewed through February 25, 2024 (the "Advisory Agreement"). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company incurred 6,489,991 and 7,065,751 , respectively in asset management fees and 3,151,543 and 3,320,467 , respectively in incentive fees to our Advisor. 

14

Table of Contents 

Asset Management Fee 
 
 The asset management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00 of our gross assets payable quarterly in arrears. For purposes of calculating the asset management fee, the term gross assets means the total net fair value of the Company s assets at the end of the quarter, other than intangibles and after the deduction of associated allowance and reserves, as determined by the Advisor in its sole discretion. 
 
 Incentive Fee 
 
 The incentive fee is comprised of two parts: (i) a subordinated incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. Each part of the incentive fee is outlined below. 
 
 The subordinated incentive fee on income is earned on pre-incentive fee net investment income and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar quarter during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of the termination. 
 
 The subordinated incentive fee on income is subject to a quarterly preferred return to investors, expressed as a rate of return on net assets at the beginning of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.50 (6.0 annualized), subject to a catch up feature. The subordinated incentive fee on income for each quarter is calculated as follows: 
 
 No incentive fee is earned by the Advisor in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50 , or the preferred return. 
 
 100 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the quarterly preferred return, but is less than or equal to 1.875 (7.5 annualized) on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, in any quarter, is payable to the Advisor. We refer to this portion of our subordinated incentive fee on income as the catch up. It is intended to provide an incentive fee of 20 on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875 on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter in any quarter. 
 
 For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.875 on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the subordinated incentive fee on income equals 20 of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, because the preferred return and catch up will have been achieved. 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter, including the asset management fee and operating expenses reimbursed to the Advisor. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the quarterly subordinated incentive fee on income: 
 
 Quarterly Subordinated Incentive Fee on Income 
 
 Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 (expressed as a percentage of net assets) 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income 
 allocated to quarterly incentive fee 
 
 The incentive fee on capital gains is earned on investments sold or matured and shall be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. In the case the Advisory Agreement is terminated, the fee will also become payable as of the effective date of such termination. The fee will equal 20 of our realized capital gains, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains. Incentive fee on capital gains is equal to our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. 
 
 Because of the structure of the subordinated incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains, it is possible that we may pay such fees in a quarter where we incur a net loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the 1.75 on our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a net loss in the quarter due to a realized or unrealized capital loss. Our Advisor will not be under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on prior period accrued income that we never receive as a result of a subsequent decline in the value of our portfolio.

Table of Contents 

The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated. The fees are calculated using a detailed policy and procedure approved by our Advisor and our board of managers, including a majority of the independent managers, and such policy and procedure is consistent with the description of the calculation of the fees set forth above. 
 
 Our Advisor may elect to defer or waive all or a portion of the fees that would otherwise be paid to it in its sole discretion. Any portion of a fee not taken as to any month, quarter or year will be deferred without interest and may be taken in any such other month prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event as our Advisor may determine in its sole discretion. In recognition of the challenges resulting from the pandemic between 2020 and 2022, which has had a significant negative impact (although unrealized at this point) on our performance and our investors, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2022, our Advisor determined to voluntarily waive all incentive fees that may become due and payable to our Advisor for the year ending December 31, 2023. This is a waiver, rather than a deferral, and any amounts waived for 2023 will not be paid to our Advisor in the future. 
 
 Investment Company Act Considerations 
 
 We have conducted and intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we and our subsidiaries will qualify for an exemption under, or otherwise will not be required to register as an investment company under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Company Act. 
 
 Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of the issuer s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40 test. Excluded from the term investment securities, among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
 
 We conduct our business primarily through our direct and indirect wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, which were established to carry out specific activities. Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, the focus of our business involves providing loans and other financing of the nature described in this Form 10-K. We conduct our operations so that they comply with the limit imposed by the 40 test and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or actually engaged, in the business of investing in securities. Therefore, we expect that we will not be subject to registration or regulation as an investment company of any kind (including, without limitation, a face-amount certificate company, unit investment trust, open-end or closed-end company or a management company electing to be treated as a business development company) under the Investment Company Act. The securities issued to us by our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, which subsidiaries will be neither investment companies nor companies exempt under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, will not be investment securities for the purpose of this 40 test. 
 
 One or more of our subsidiaries may seek to qualify for an exception or exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to other provisions of the Investment Company Act, such as Sections 3(c)(5)(A) which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services and Section 3(c)(5)(B) which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance and services. Each of these exemptions generally requires that at least 55 of such subsidiary s assets be invested in eligible loans and receivables. To qualify for either of the foregoing exemptions, the subsidiary would be required to comply with interpretations issued by the staff of the SEC that govern the respective activities. 
 
 We monitor our holdings and those of our subsidiaries to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with these and/or other applicable tests, and we are responsible for making the determinations and calculations required to confirm our compliance with tests. If the SEC does not agree with our determinations, we may be required to adjust our activities and/or those of our subsidiaries. 
 
 Qualification for these or other exceptions or exemptions could affect our ability to originate, participate in or hold fixed-income assets, or could require us to dispose of investments that we might prefer to retain in order to remain qualified for such exemptions. Changes in current policies by the SEC and its staff could also require that we alter our business activities for this purpose. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the Investment Company Act, please see Risk Factors. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We compete with a large number of commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, private equity funds, leveraged buyout and venture capital funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their market shares.

Concentration of credit risk 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our portfoli o of 273,616,782 (at fair value) included 36 companies and was comprised of 105,084,728 or 38.5 in senior secured term loans, 119,690,547 or 43.7 in senior secured term loan participations, 31,710,623 or 11.6 in senior secured trade finance participations, and 17,130,884 or 6.2 in other investments. Our largest loan by value was 38,841,010 or 14.2 of our total portfolio and provides for paid in kind PIK interest, with principal and interest due at maturity. Our 5 largest loans by value comprised 40.3 of our portfolio at December 31, 2022 . Participation in loans represented 55.3 of our portfolio at December 31, 2022 . 
 
 Employees 
 
 We have no employees. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, our Advisor assumes principal responsibility for managing our affairs and we compensate the Advisor for these services.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should carefully read and consider the risks described below together with all other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to purchase our units. If certain of the following risks actually occur, our results of operations and ability to pay distributions would likely suffer materially, or could be eliminated entirely. As a result, the value of our units may decline, and our unitholders could lose all or part of the money they paid to buy our units. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure: General 
 
 The lack of liquidity of our privately held investments may adversely affect our business. 
 
 Most of our investments consist and will continue to consist of loans and other fixed income instruments either originated in private transactions directly with the borrowers or via participation agreements with the direct lenders. Investments may be subject to restrictions on resale, including, in some instances, legal restrictions, or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to quickly obtain cash equal to the value at which we record our investments if the need arises. This could cause us to miss important business opportunities or react to changes in the market. In addition, if we are required to quickly liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a public company to the extent that the Company, its Advisor, or respective officers, employees or affiliates have material non-public information regarding such company. 
 
 When we are a debt or minority equity investor in a portfolio company, which we expect will generally be the case, we may not be in a position to control the entity, and its management may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment. 
 
 Most of our investments are and, we anticipate will continue to be in the future, either debt or minority equity investments in our portfolio companies. Therefore, we will be subject to risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our best interests. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings. In addition, we will generally not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities.

Table of Contents 

Floating rate investments subject us to certain risks related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. 
 
 A portion of our investments bear interest at floating rates based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR ). In July 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022 into law, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, containing legislation related to the transition away from LIBOR. This legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of LIBOR and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The transition away from LIBOR could cause interest rates on our debt to decrease, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in the current form. 
 
 LIBOR was phased out completely in June 2023, and new contracts ceased to be written using USD LIBOR at the beginning of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 11.3 of the fair value of the Company s total investments bore interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, with an alternative rate to be designated by the Company in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. 
 
 The Company s legacy loans transitioned from LIBOR to Synthetic LIBOR in July 2023 and this rate is expected to stay in effect until September 30, 2024. There can be no assurances as to whether this alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. The discontinuation of LIBOR and the use of alternative rates, such as Synthetic LIBOR, could result in interest rate decreases on our debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow, operating results and ability to make distributions to our unitholders at expected levels or at all. 
 
 We may be exposed to higher risks with respect to our investments that include PIK interest, particularly our investments in interest-only loans. 
 
 We have investments in loans that contain a PIK interest provision, including our largest loan, which made up 14.2 of our total portfolio by value as of December 31, 2022. These investments may expose us to higher risks, including the following: 

because PIK interest results in an increase in the size of the loan balance of the underlying loan, our exposure to potential loss increases when we receive PIK interest; and 

it may be more difficult to value investments that include PIK interest because their continuing accruals of interest require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of the underlying collateral. 

To the extent our investments are structured as interest-only loans, PIK interest will increase the size of the balloon payment due at the end of the loan term. PIK interest payments on such loans may increase the probability and magnitude of a loss on our investment. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. 
 
 A large number of entities compete with us and make the types of investments that we seek to make in small and medium-sized privately owned businesses. We compete with a large number of commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, private equity funds, leveraged buyout and venture capital funds, investment banks and other equity and non-equity based investment funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships and build their market shares. The competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, or to identify and make investments that satisfy our investment objectives or that we will be able to fully invest our available capital. 
 
 An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key borrower and/or sub-advisor personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns. 
 
 We have invested, and will continue to invest in the future, primarily in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we will be required to rely on the ability of the Advisor and the respective sub-advisors investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investments made in, with or through these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Please see the Watch List Investments section in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information about investments for which we have not been provided with accurate and complete information from a prior sub-advisor, IIG, which has adversely impacted the value of certain of these investments.

We may not realize gains from equity instruments granted as return enhancement vehicles when we acquire certain debt instruments. 
 
 When we invest in collateralized or senior secured loans, we may acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. Our goal is to ultimately dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. 
 
 Actions of our sub-advisors and other investment partners could negatively impact our performance. 
 
 We participate in investments with third parties. Specifically, we participate in investments originated by our third-party sub-advisors, whom we also refer to as investments partners. Such participations may involve risks not otherwise present with a direct origination of loans, including, for example: 

The risk that our investment partner in an investment might become bankrupt or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations; 

The risk that our investment partner will be ineffective or materially underperform relative to our expectations; 

The risk that our investment partner will provide us with incomplete or inaccurate information or will misapply our funds; 

The risk that the due diligence conducted by the investment partner may fail to reveal all material risks of an investment or that the investment partner omits material information about the investment, which could result in the Company being materially adversely affected; 

The risk that our investment partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals which are or which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals; 

The risk that our investment partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; or 

The risk that actions by such partner could adversely affect our reputation, negatively impacting our ability to conduct business. 

Actions by such an investment partner, which are generally out of our control, might have the result of subjecting the investment to liabilities in excess of those contemplated and may have the effect of reducing our unitholders returns, particularly if the loan agreement provides that our partner can take actions contrary to our interests. As of December 31, 2022 , 55.3 of the fair value of our investment portfolio consisted of participations in loans. As described further in the Watch List Investments section in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information , IIG was the sub-advisor with respect to five of the 22 investments that we have deemed Watch List investments, which are investments with respect to which we have determined there have been significant changes in the credit and collection risk of the investment. As described in that section, IIG has failed to provide us with complete and accurate information with respect to our investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor, and, in 2017, sold us a 6 million participation in a loan that did not exist. We have not received any material updated information from IIG concerning the investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor since the first quarter of 2019, despite IIG being contractually obligated to provide the Company with updated information. IIG s acts and omissions have negatively affected the value of certain of our investments, which could adversely affect returns to our unitholders. As of December 31, 2022 , 7.4 of our por tfolio (by fair value) consisted of investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor, all of which are deemed Watch List investments. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic markets and the prolonged economic impact is uncertain. Economic slowdowns or recessions could impair our borrowers and harm our operating results. 
 
 Our borrowers, as with all businesses, are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and disruptions, such as the disruption and adverse impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lingering economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in some of our borrowers having difficulties repaying the loans in which we have invested or originated. For example, many businesses across the globe saw a downturn in production and productivity due to the suspension of business and temporary closure of offices and factories in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19, and the resulting economic impacts are still affecting many of our borrowers. Therefore, our non-performing assets, or borrowers requiring some form of forbearance, may increase and the value of our portfolio may correspondingly decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans (including loans in which we have acquired participations), which could lead to reduced recovery values should liquidation ultimately be required.

W hile many of the economic effects of COVID-19 appeared to moderate over the course of 2021 and 2022, the global economic environment has not fully normalized, and the global scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related uncertainties have adversely impacted many industries and businesses directly and indirectly. Adverse impacts include disrupted global travel and supply chains, which adversely impact global commercial activity. It is critical that supply chain disruptions and the resulting high input costs moderate in order for economic conditions to fully normalize. As of the date of this report, many of our borrowers have experienced disruption in their operations related to COVID-19, to varying degrees. As of the date of this report, COVID-19 has had a significant impact with respect to current and future payment performance with respect t o 20.2 of our in vestments (based on the fair value of the investments as of December 31, 2022). These borrowers have experienced material losses to revenues. Where appropriate, we and our sub-advisors have attempted to work with borrowers to restructure facilities or extended payment due dates and maturity dates. With respect to one investment, where restructuring has not been successful, we have issued a notice of default and are pursuing legal action to recover amounts due. 
 
 In addition to the adverse impact on many of our borrowers, we have also seen a slow down in transaction volume due to the impact of the pandemic. To the extent the disruption and negative impact of the pandemic continues in future periods, we may have additional borrower defaults, which could further negatively impact our NAV. The ongoing adverse impact of COVID-19 was a significant contributor to the approximate 1.20 decline in our NAV per unit as of December 31, 2022 , as compared to our NAV per unit as of December 31, 2021 . 
 
 Further, our borrowers, particularly in Emerging Asia, were adversely affected by China s decision to close its markets off-and-on throughout much of 2022 as part of its Zero Covid policy. In early December 2022, however, China announced a nationwide loosening of its Zero Covid policy, meaning essentially all global economies are past lockdown measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the loosening of restrictions in China also triggered a wave in infections in mainland China. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic still depends on the future developments of the pandemic, including new information concerning the global severity of and actions taken to contain the pandemic, or the possible appearance of new or more severe strains of the virus, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 
 
 Any of these adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We face risks related to health epidemics which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects could include disruptions or restrictions on our employees ability to travel, including trips to meet with sub-advisors and borrowers in other countries, which could hinder our ability to effectively oversee our investments. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of the countries where our borrowers operate their businesses. 
 
 Our borrowers may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt instruments in which we invest. 
 
 Our borrowers may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt instruments in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a borrower, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that borrower would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution with respect to our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such borrower may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with that of our debt instruments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant borrower. In addition, we may not be in a position to control any borrower through the loans we make. As a result, we are subject to the risk that any borrower in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors.

Table of Contents 

There is a risk that our unitholders may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time or may be reduced. 
 
 We may not achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions. In addition, due to covenants and asset coverage tests, which may apply to us in the event we choose to employ financial leverage, we may be subject to restrictions on unitholder distributions. 
 
 From time to time, our board of managers may change the amount of distributions that are paid, if paid at all. For example, the daily distribution rate was reduced in March 2018 and was further reduced as of May 1, 2021. Daily distributions per unit are expected to be paid for periods on and after May 1, 2021 in an annualized amount equal to approximately 7.0 of the most recently determined NAV per unit disclosed by us at the time the distribution is declared, although there can be no assurances that our board of managers will authorize distributions at this approximate annualized rate or at all. Since our NAV per unit can vary from quarter to quarter, if our board of managers continues to authorize daily distributions at an annualized rate that is based on our most recently determined NAV per unit, it is likely that the per unit dollar amount of distributions paid to our unitholders will similarly vary. 
 
 Our Sponsor is under no obligation to pay our operating expenses, and if we do not generate sufficient investment income to cover our operating expenses, our distributions to our unitholders may further be reduced. 
 
 If we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for the investments, and the overall return for our unitholders may be reduced. 
 
 Our operating agreement permits us to make distributions from any source, including offering proceeds and, subject to certain limitations, borrowings, and we may choose to pay distributions from such other sources when we do not have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund such distributions. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use to fund distributions. From time to time during our operational stage, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distributions. If we fund distributions from borrowings or the net proceeds from this offering, we will have less funds available for the investments, and your overall return may be reduced. 
 
 If we internalize our management functions, we could incur adverse effects on our business and financial condition, including significant costs associated with becoming and being self-managed and the percentage of our units owned by our unitholders could be reduced. 
 
 If we seek to list our units on an exchange as a way of providing our unitholders with a liquidity event, we may consider internalizing the functions performed for us by our Advisor. An internalization could take many forms, for example, we may hire our own group of executives and other employees or we may acquire our Advisor or its respective assets including its existing workforce. Internalizing our management functions may not result in anticipated benefits to us and our unitholders. For example, we may not realize the perceived benefits because of: (i) the costs of being self-managed; (ii) our inability to effectively integrate a new staff of managers and employees; or (iii) our inability to properly replicate the services provided previously by our Advisor or its affiliates. Additionally, internalization transactions have also, in some cases, been the subject of litigation and even if these claims are without merit, we could be forced to spend significant amounts of money defending claims which would reduce the amount of funds available for us to make investments or to pay distributions. In connection with any such internalization transaction, a special committee consisting of all or some of our independent managers will be appointed to evaluate the transaction and to determine whether a fairness opinion should be obtained. 
 
 We may engage in hedging activity, which could expose us to risks associated with such transactions, including the risk that we may artificially limit the investment income realized by the Company on certain investments. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had not engaged in any significant hedging transactions. If we do engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation for any given investment at an acceptable price. 

21

Table of Contents 

The success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements, currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of investments denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those investments is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. 
 
 Our business plan anticipates external financing which may expose us to risks associated with leverage. 
 
 In order to achieve our investment objectives and our originally anticipated returns, we will need to utilize financial leverage. We may borrow money in order to make investments, for working capital and to make distributions to our unitholders. Under current or future market conditions, we may not be able to borrow all of the funds we may need. If we cannot obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire new investments to expand our operations will be adversely affected and we may be unable to pay distributions. As a result, we would be less able to achieve our investment objectives, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Furthermore, borrowing money for investments increases the risk of a loss. A decrease in the value of our investments will have a greater impact on the value of units to the extent that we have borrowed money to make investments. There is a possibility that the costs of borrowing could exceed the income we receive on the investments we make with such borrowed funds. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks that our cash flow will not be sufficient to cover the required debt service payments and that we will be unable to meet the other covenants or requirements of the credit agreements. In addition, our ability to pay distributions or incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by our credit agreements. If the value of our assets declines, we may be required to liquidate a portion or our entire investment portfolio and repay a portion or all of our indebtedness at a time when liquidation may be disadvantageous. Furthermore, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness will not be available for distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, all of our outstanding debt was collateralized with sh ares of the Company s subsidiary that holds all of the Company s assets and if we default on the payment our credit holders will have rights against such collateral, thereby reducing our asset base and the income we receive from such investments. As of December 31, 2022 , we had approximately 17 million debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, with a debt to equity ratio of 6.0 . As of September 1, 2023, we had no debt outstanding. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11. Subsequent Events." 
 
 We may enter into and have entered into financing arrangements involving balloon payment obligations, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 Some of our financing arrangements require us to make a lump-sum or balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make a balloon payment at maturity will be uncertain and may depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing. At the time the balloon payment is due, we may or may not be able to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original financing. The effect of a refinancing could affect the rate of return to our unitholders. In addition, payments of principal and interest made to service our debts, including balloon payments, may reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 17 million in total debt, of which the first payment of 4.5 million was due in December 2026. As of September 1, 2023, we had no debt outstanding. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11. Subsequent Events." 
 
 We may be unable to invest a significant portion of our raised capital on acceptable terms or within the time period we anticipate. 
 
 Delays in investing our raised capital may impair our performance. We may be unable to identify any investment opportunities that meet our investment objectives or that any investment that we make will produce a positive return. We may be unable to invest the net proceeds from our private placement of units, our notes offerings or future offerings on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate or at all, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 We expect to invest proceeds we receive from our raised capital in short-term, highly-liquid investments until we use such funds to invest in assets meeting our investment objectives. The income we earn on these temporary investments is not substantial. Further, we may use the principal amount of these investments, and any returns generated on these investments, to pay for fees and expenses in connection with our capital raises and distributions. Therefore, delays in investing proceeds from our raised capital could impact the amount of and our ability to generate cash flow for distributions.

Table of Contents 

We may enter into financing arrangements that require us to enter into restrictive covenants that relate to or otherwise limit our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, to replace the Advisor or to otherwise achieve our investment objectives. 
 
 When providing financing, a lender may impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Financing documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances. In addition, provisions of our financing documents may deter us from replacing our Advisor because of the consequences under such agreements. These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 
 
 A change in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability and our hedging strategy may expose us to additional risks. 
 
 We may use a combination of equity and long-term and short-term borrowings denominated in one or more currencies to finance our lending activities. If we utilize borrowings, a portion of our income will depend upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan these funds. Certain of our borrowings may be at fixed rates and others at variable rates. In connection with any borrowings, we may decide to enter into interest rate hedging interests. Hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. An increase in interest rates would decrease the value of our investments were we seeking to liquidate our portfolio. 
 
 Our investments may be long term and may require several years to realize liquidation events. 
 
 We anticipate maintaining an average portfolio duration in excess of two years with regard to our debt investments. As a result, our unitholders should not expect liquidity, if any, to occur over the near term. In addition, we expect that any warrants or other return enhancements that we receive when we make loans may require several years to appreciate in value and may not appreciate at all. 
 
 Prepayments by our borrowers could adversely impact our operating results, reducing total income and increasing the number of investments the Company will have to execute. 
 
 We are also subject to the risk that investments that we make may be repaid prior to scheduled maturity. In such an event, we will generally use proceeds from prepayments first to repay any borrowings outstanding on any line of credit, if we have any outstanding. In the event that funds remain after repayment of our outstanding borrowings, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in short-term securities, pending their future investment in new investment instruments. These short-term securities will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt securities being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. As a result, our operating results could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our borrowers elect to prepay amounts owed to us. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not receive any such material prepayments. 
 
 Non-payment by borrowers and acts or omissions by our sub-advisors that result in us not being repaid for our investments has and may continue to prevent us from realizing expected income and has and may continue to result in a decrease in our net asset value. 
 
 All of our fixed-income investments are subject to the risk that a borrower will fail to repay a portion or all of periodically scheduled interest and/or principal payments. When this occurs, we fail to realize expected income and, in some instances, this has resulted and may continue to result in a write-down of the value of under-performing loans as well as our net asset value. As of December 31, 2022, we ha d 22 b orrowers who had failed to repay principal and interest and were included on our Watch List. Please see the Watch List Investments section in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information about the Watch List. 
 
 We allocate substantially all of our fixed-income investment capital to unrated instruments, which may be viewed as highly speculative. 
 
 We have and will likely continue to allocate substantially all of our fixed-income investment capital to unrated instruments. Such instruments may be viewed as highly speculative and the recovery of projected interest and principal payments is reliant on the Advisor s and sub-advisors ability to accurately underwrite and manage our investments.

Risks Related to Investments in Small and Medium-Sized Businesses 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses may have limited financial resources and may not be able to repay the loans we make to them. 
 
 Our strategy includes providing financing to borrowers that typically is not readily available to them. This may make it difficult for the borrowers to repay their loans to us. A borrower s ability to repay its loan may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including the failure to meet its business plan, a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions. A deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects will usually be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing on any guarantees we may have obtained from the borrower s management. We may at times be subordinated to a senior lender, and, in such situations, our interest in any collateral would likely be subordinate to another lender s security interest. 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses typically have narrower product offerings and smaller market shares than large businesses. 
 
 Because our target borrowers are smaller businesses, they tend to be more vulnerable to competitors actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. In addition, borrowers may face intense competition, including competition from companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses generally have less predictable operating results. 
 
 Our borrowers may have significant variations in their operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position, may otherwise have a weak financial position or may be adversely affected by changes in the business cycle. Our borrowers may not meet net income, cash flow and other coverage tests typically imposed by their senior lenders. A borrower s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by senior lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, foreclosure on its senior credit facility, which could additionally trigger cross-defaults in other agreements. If this were to occur, it is possible that the borrower s ability to repay our loan would be jeopardized. 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses are more likely to be dependent on one or two persons. 
 
 Typically, the success of a small or medium-sized business depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons. The death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our borrower and, in turn, on us. 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses are likely to have greater exposure to economic downturns than larger businesses. 
 
 Our borrowers tend to have fewer resources than larger businesses and an economic downturn is more likely to have a material adverse effect on them. If one of our borrowers is adversely impacted by an economic downturn, its ability to repay our loan would be diminished. 
 
 Small and medium-sized businesses may have limited operating histories. 
 
 Borrowers with limited operating histories will be exposed to all of the operating risks that new businesses face and may be particularly susceptible to, among other risks, market downturns, competitive pressures and the departure of key executive officers. 
 
 Lack of minimum requirements when lending to small and medium-sized businesses could increase the risk of default. 
 
 Although our investment strategy is focused on small and medium-sized businesses meeting certain underwriting criteria, we are not required to invest only in businesses meeting certain minimum asset size, revenue size or profitability standards and the lack of these minimum requirements could create additional risks with respect to our investments, including the risk of default. 
 
 Risks Related to Non-U.S. Investments 
 
 Our investments in foreign debt and equity instruments may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments. 
 
 Our investment strategy contemplates investing primarily in debt and equity instruments issued by foreign companies. During 2022 and 2021, we have made loans to companies locate d in Argentina, Botswana, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Croatia, Guatemala, Mauritius, Zambia, Jersey, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and Uganda. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include the economic disruption caused by the global outbreak of COVID-19 and changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the U.S., higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. 

24

Table of Contents 

Non-U.S. investments involve certain legal, geopolitical, investment, repatriation, and transparency risks not typically associated with investing in the U.S. 

Legal Risk: The legal framework of certain developing countries is rapidly evolving and it is not possible to accurately predict the content or implications of changes in their statutes or regulations. Existing legal frameworks may be unfairly or unevenly enforced, and courts may decline to enforce legal protections covering our investments altogether. The cost and difficulties of litigation in these countries may make enforcement of our rights impractical or impossible. Adverse regulation or legislation may be introduced at any time without prior warning or consultation. 

Geopolitical Risk: Given that we invest in developing economies, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation, unfavorable regulation, economic, political, or social instability, military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, war, or terrorism which could adversely affect the economies of a given jurisdiction or lead to a material adverse change in the value of our investments in such jurisdiction. 

Investment Repatriation Risks: Significant time and/or financial resources may be required to obtain necessary government approval for us to invest under certain circumstances. In addition, we may invest in jurisdictions that become subject to investment restrictions as a result of economic or other sanctions after the time of our investment. Under such circumstances, we may be required to divest of certain investments at a loss. 

Transparency Risks: Disclosure, accounting, and financial standards in developing economies vary widely and may not be equivalent to those of developed countries. Although our Advisor will use its best efforts to verify information supplied to it and will engage qualified sub-advisors when appropriate, our investments may still be adversely affected by such risks. 

Fluctuation in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our borrowers ability to pay U.S. dollars denominated loans 
 
 For investment denominated in U.S. dollars, if the U.S. dollar rises, it may become more difficult for borrowers to make loan payments if the borrowers are operating in markets where the local currencies are depreciating relative the U.S. dollar. 
 
 Our strategy or emphasis on environmental, social and governance ESG and impact factors may limit the investment opportunities available. 
 
 Therefore, we may underperform or perform differently than other portfolios that do not have an ESG or impact investment focus. As part of our strategy, we utilize screening and other exclusionary tools in our ESG and impact investing methodology. As such, we may forego opportunities to make certain investments when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or redeem investments based on their ESG and impact methodology criteria when it might otherwise be disadvantageous to do so. Further, in assigning an ESG and Impact Rating, we may depend on information that is incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable and investments that are assigned a higher rating may underperform similar investments or borrower companies with lower ratings. 
 
 Economic and trade sanctions laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us, our sub-advisors or borrower companies from transacting with or in certain countries and/or with certain individuals. 
 
 Such sanctions prohibit, among other things, transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain non-U.S. countries, territories, entities and individuals who have been placed on the sanctions list administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). In addition, certain programs administered by OFAC prohibit dealing with individuals or entities in certain countries or subject to certain sanction programs regardless of whether such individuals or entities appear on the lists maintained by OFAC, which may make it more difficult for us and our sub-advisors to identify sanctioned parties and prevent dealings with them or significantly restrict or limit investment activities in certain jurisdictions. 
 
 Lack of compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 
 
 We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including potential competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Fraudulent practices, including corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and others, occur from time-to-time in countries in which we may do business. If people acting on our behalf or at our request are found to have engaged in such practices, severe penalties and other consequences could be imposed on us that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, our ability to make distributions to you and the value of your investment. 
 
 Risks Related to our Advisor and its Affiliates 
 
 We are dependent upon our key management personnel and the key management personnel of our Advisor, who will face conflicts of interest relating to time management, and on our Advisor and its affiliates, for our future success. 
 
 We have no employees. Our executive officers and the officers and employees of our Advisor and its affiliates may hold similar positions in other affiliated entities and they may from time to time allocate more of their time to service the needs of such entities than they allocate to servicing our needs. 
 
 In addition, we have no separate facilities and are completely reliant on our Advisor, which has significant discretion as to the implementation and execution of our business strategies and risk management practices. We are subject to the risk of discontinuation of our Advisor s operations or termination of the Advisory Agreement and the risk that, upon such event, no suitable replacement will be found. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon our Advisor and that discontinuation of its operations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 
 
 The Advisor and its affiliates are responsible for selecting the sub-advisors. Although our Advisor retains ultimate responsibility for the performance of services under the Advisory Agreement, it can delegate its responsibilities to one of its affiliates or a third party. If our Advisor or any of its affiliates fail to perform according to our expectations and in accordance with the Advisory Agreement, we could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We may compete with other Sponsor affiliated entities for opportunities to originate or participate in investments, which may have an adverse impact on our operations. 
 
 We may compete with other Sponsor affiliated entities, and with other entities that Sponsor affiliated entities may advise or own interests in, whether existing or created in the future, for opportunities to originate or participate in impact investments. The Advisor may face conflicts of interest when evaluating investment opportunities for us and other owned and/or managed by Sponsor affiliated entities and these conflicts of interest may have a negative impact on us. 

25

Table of Contents 

Sponsor affiliated entities may have, and additional entities (including those that may be advised by Sponsor affiliated entities or in which Sponsor affiliated entities own interests) may be given, priority over us with respect to the acquisition of certain types of investments. As a result of our potential competition with these entities, certain investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us may not in fact be available. 
 
 Our success will be dependent on the performance of our sub-advisors and our sub-advisors failure to identify and make investments that meet our investment criteria or perform their responsibilities under the sub-advisory agreements may adversely affect our ability to realize our investment objectives. 
 
 Our Advisor employs sub-advisors in its execution of the investment strategy, not all of whom have been identified. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives will depend, in part, on our sub-advisors ability to identify and invest in debt and equity instruments that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will, in part, be a function of our sub-advisors execution of the investment process, their capacity to provide competent and efficient services to us, and, their ability to source attractive investments. Sub-advisors are responsible for locating, performing due diligence and closing on suitable acquisitions based on their access to local markets, local market knowledge for quality deal flow and extensive local private credit experience. Our sub-advisors will have substantial responsibilities under the sub-advisory agreements. Any failure to manage the investment process effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because the sub-advisors are separate companies from our Advisor, the risk exists that our sub-advisors will be ineffective or materially underperform. In addition, the Sub-Advisory Agreements with the sub-advisors can only be terminated under specific circumstances and they do not automatically terminate upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement. 
 
 We may be unable to find suitable investments through our sub-advisors. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions will be dependent upon the performance of our local sub-advisors in the identification, performance of due diligence on and acquisition of investments, the determination of any financing arrangements, and the management of our projects and assets. If our sub-advisors fail to perform according to our expectations, or if the due diligence conducted by the sub-advisors fails to reveal all material risks of the businesses of our target investments, we could be materially adversely affected. Our former sub-advisor, IIG, failed to perform all of its responsibilities under its sub-advisory agreement with us, which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our ability to ascertain information about certain of our investments and the value of certain of our investments. 
 
 We have paid substantial compensation to our Advisor and its affiliates. The compensation we pay to the Advisor and its affiliates may be increased by our independent managers. This compensation was not determined on an arm s-length basis and therefore may not be on the same terms we could achieve from a third party. 
 
 The compensation paid to our Advisor and its affiliates was not determined on an arm s-length basis. A third party unaffiliated with us may be willing and able to provide certain services to us at a lower price. 
 
 In addition, subject to limitations in our operating agreement, the fees, compensation, income, expense reimbursements, interests and other payments payable to our Advisor and its affiliates may increase in the future from those previously disclosed, if such increase is approved by a majority of our independent managers. 
 
 There are significant potential conflicts of interest, which could impact our investment returns. 
 
 In the course of our investing activities, we also pay management and incentive fees to our Advisor and reimburse our Advisor for certain administrative expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. As a result, our investors invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve by making direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of our Advisor has interests that differ from those of our unitholders, giving rise to a conflict. For example, our Advisor has incentives to recommend that we make investments using borrowings since the asset management fees that we pay to our Advisor will increase if we use borrowings in connection with our investments. 
 
 Our subordinated incentive fee may induce our Advisor to make certain investments, including speculative investments. 
 
 The management compensation structure that has been implemented under the Advisory Agreement with our Advisor may cause our Advisor to invest in higher-risk investments or take other risks. In addition to its asset management fee, our Advisor is entitled under the Advisory Agreement to receive subordinated incentive compensation based in part upon our achievement of specified levels of net cash flows. The incentive fee payable by us to our Advisor may create an incentive for the Advisor to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee payable from operations, sales or other sources is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of our net cash flows, may encourage our Advisor to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor our unitholders. 
 
 In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn subordinated incentive compensation may lead our Advisor to place undue emphasis on the maximization of investment income at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity, or management of credit risk or market risk, in order to achieve higher subordinated incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio. 
 
 We rely on third-party service providers to perform and support certain advisory services and processes. 
 
 These services include but are not limited to, investment research, risk management, compliance, valuation services, financial reporting, audit, custody and information technology. If a third-party service provider causes actions or errors resulting in failure to perform its duties or participates in unauthorized activities, misappropriates assets, fails to identify or disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest, or otherwise engage in any misconduct, we may suffer adverse consequences. Such consequences could include serious financial harm and could result in litigation or regulatory breach or other unknown or unmanaged risks. There is no guarantee that the due diligence we perform will confirm their reliability, identify risks, or prevent any misconduct, or that we have any recourse against them.

Risks related to Tax Matters 
 
 Our failure to be taxed as a partnership may result in adverse tax consequences for us and our investors. 
 
 We intend to be treated as a partnership (other than a publicly traded partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation. We have not sought a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, on our tax treatment as a partnership, and there is no guarantee that such treatment would be sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS. 
 
 If we were taxable as a corporation, we would not be entitled to pass through our income and losses to our unitholders. Instead, we would, among other things, be subject to income tax on our income and profits in the same manner and at the same rate as a corporation, and our losses, if any, would not pass through to the unitholders. Unitholders would be taxed upon distributions in the same manner that corporate shareholders are taxed on corporate distributions, resulting in distributions being treated as taxable dividends to the extent of our earnings and profits; as non-taxable returns of capital to the extent they exceed our earnings and profits, up to the unitholder s basis in its units, and thereafter as gain on sale of the unitholder s units. 
 
 Transfer restrictions imposed with respect to our interests and potential restructurings or agreements we enter into to avoid publicly traded partnership status, may adversely impact a unitholder s ability to transfer or sell its units. 
 
 No transfer of an interest may be made if it would result in the Company being treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We may, without the consent of any unitholder, amend our operating agreement in order to improve, upon advice of counsel, the Company s position in avoiding such publicly traded partnership status for the Company (and we may impose time-delay and other restrictions on recognizing transfers or on repurchases pursuant to unit repurchase program as necessary to do so). Furthermore, we, upon advice of counsel, may restructure the Company (including the creation or liquidation of subsidiary entities) and/or enter into any agreements that we deem necessary, without the prior approval of the unitholders, if such activities are reasonably determined by us, in our sole discretion, to avoid the Company being characterized as a publicly traded partnership under the Code that is taxable as a corporation. 
 
 Unitholders may be allocated taxable income in excess of the cash available for distribution to them. 
 
 For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or contracted payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to our overall investment activities, or increases in loan balances as a result of contracted payment-in-kind arrangements, will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We may also be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash. If a borrower defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously reported as investment income will become uncollectible. 
 
 Since in certain cases we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income, for any given period, unitholders may recognize taxable income with respect to their units in excess of the cash distributions made to them. 
 
 Additionally, the payment of the distribution fee over time with respect to the Class C units, certain Class I units, and Class W units is deemed to be paid from cash distributions that would otherwise be distributable to such unitholders. Accordingly, the holders of Class C units, certain Class I units, and Class W units will receive a lower cash distribution to the extent of such unitholders obligation to pay such fees. Because the payment of such fees is not a deductible expense for tax purposes, the taxable income of the Company allocable to the Class C, certain Class I, and Class W unitholders may, therefore, exceed the amount of cash distributions made to such unitholders. 
 
 An audit or tax adjustment by the IRS may result in additional taxes or costs to the Company and our unitholders. 
 
 We have not requested and do not currently intend to request rulings from the IRS with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Company or our unitholders. Thus, positions to be taken by the IRS as to any such tax consequences could differ from positions taken by us. If the IRS challenges certain U.S. federal income tax positions taken by us if we are audited, any adjustment to our return resulting from such an audit would result in adjustments to tax returns of our unitholders and might result in an examination of items in such returns unrelated to their investment in the units or an examination of tax returns for prior or later years. Moreover, we and our unitholders could incur substantial legal and accounting costs in contesting any IRS challenge, regardless of the outcome. Our management generally will have the authority and power to act for, and bind the Company in connection with, any such audit or adjustment for administrative or judicial proceedings in connection therewith.

Pursuant to legislative changes enacted in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which are effective for tax years beginning in 2018, the IRS may, in certain circumstances, collect taxes (together with applicable interest and penalties) directly from the Company following a determination that the Company has underreported taxable income to our unitholders with respect to such years. The payment of such taxes by the Company would reduce the funds available for distribution by the Company, and could adversely affect the value of our units. 
 
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may Adversely Affect the Company, its Subsidiaries or Unitholders 
 
 On December 22, 2017, P.L. 115-97 was signed into law, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ). The Tax Act makes significant changes to the Code, including a number of provisions that could affect the taxation of the Company, its subsidiaries or unitholders. The Tax Act limits the ability of taxpayers to utilize certain tax attributes, including the following: 

The amount of business interest expense that may be deducted in a particular year generally cannot exceed the sum of (i) the taxpayer s business interest income, and (ii) 30 of its taxable income, as adjusted. 

A limitation on the ability of non-corporate taxpayers to deduct excess losses incurred in businesses. Any loss that is disallowed as an excess business loss is treated as a net operating loss carryover to the following tax year. 

Net operating losses carried forward to a subsequent tax year may not reduce more than 80 of the income generated in the subsequent year. 

The Tax Act also requires taxpayers to recognize certain income for tax purposes not later than the taxable year in which such income is taken into account in an applicable financial statement, which may, in some cases, accelerate the taxation of our income. Also, although non-corporate owners of pass-through entities, including partnerships, are eligible for a new deduction under the Tax Act of up to 20 of their share of the amount of business income generated by the entity, this deduction will generally not be available to unitholders with respect to their income from the Company, which could adversely affect the value of units in the Company relative to investments in other pass-through vehicles. In addition, new provisions in the Tax Act that relate to the taxation of certain foreign earnings could, depending on their application to the Company or its subsidiaries, have adverse tax consequences. 
 
 Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our unitholders. 
 
 All statements contained in this Form 10-K concerning the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences of any investment in the Company are based upon existing law and the interpretations thereof. The income tax treatment of an investment in the Company may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative changes, possibly with retroactive effect, to the detriment of the unitholders. 
 
 Our operations may result in reportable transactions for the Company and our unitholders. 
 
 Under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, the activities of the Company may create one or more reportable transactions, requiring the Company and each unitholder, respectively, to file information returns with the IRS. We will give notice to all unitholders of any reportable transaction of which we become aware in the annual tax information provided to unitholders in order to file their tax returns. 
 
 Unitholders may be required to obtain U.S. federal income tax return filing extensions and to file tax returns in multiple jurisdictions. 
 
 We will use reasonable commercial efforts to cause all tax filings to be made in a timely manner (taking permitted extensions into account); however, investment in the Company may require the filing of tax return extensions. Unitholders may have to obtain one or more tax filing extensions if the Company does not deliver Schedules K-1 by the due date of the unitholders returns. Although our management will attempt to cause the Company to provide unitholders with estimated annual U.S. federal income tax information prior to March 15th as long as the Company s taxable year is the calendar year, the Company may not obtain annual U.S. federal income tax information from all borrowers by such date and tax return extensions may be required to be filed by unitholders. Moreover, although estimates will be provided to the unitholders by the Company in good faith based on the information obtained from the borrowers, such estimates may be different from the actual final tax information and such differences could be significant, resulting in interest and penalties to the unitholders due to underpayment of taxes or loss of use of funds for an extended period of time due to overpayment of taxes. Furthermore, the Company s activities may require unitholders to file in multiple jurisdictions if composite state returns are not filed by the Company. We may file composite state tax returns for the benefit of unitholders that elect to participate in the filing of such returns.

We may incur unrelated business taxable income which will be taxable to our tax exempt investors. 
 
 Tax-exempt investors (such as an employee pension benefit plan or an IRA) may have Unrelated Business Taxable Income, or UBTI, from investments that are made by us. We have borrowed and may in the future borrow funds, which can lead to the generation of UBTI from debt financed property. We may also receive income from services rendered in connection with making loans, which is likely to constitute UBTI. We may acquire investments that generate UBTI and unitholders can expect some or all of their allocable share of income and/or profits from the Company to be UBTI. Although we have attempted to structure our investments so as to minimize generating UBTI, there is no assurance that UBTI will not be generated from our investments. The Company will not be liable to tax-exempt investors for the recognition of UBTI. 
 
 Our operations may result in the Company being subject to foreign income taxes. 
 
 We have and may continue to conduct our activities in foreign jurisdictions and, in conjunction therewith, we have formed four subsidiaries to conduct such activities and we may form additional subsidiaries. The conduct of activities in foreign jurisdictions (whether or not foreign subsidiaries are formed to conduct such activities) may result in the Company or its subsidiaries being subject to tax in such foreign jurisdictions. Taxes paid by the Company in such foreign jurisdictions will reduce the cash available for distribution to the unitholders. However, because we are taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain foreign income taxes paid by the Company may generate a foreign tax credit that will be allocated to each unitholder, which may be used to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the tax liability of such unitholder. 
 
 Our operations may result in non-U.S. unitholders being subject to U.S. federal, state and local income and withholding tax and filing requirements. 
 
 We may generate income that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and, if so, a non-U.S. unitholder will generally be required to file an annual U.S. federal income tax return and pay U.S. federal income tax, in the same manner as a U.S. unitholder, with respect to such income. A U.S. federal withholding tax, at the highest applicable effective tax rate, generally will be imposed on a non-U.S. unitholder s allocable share of such effectively connected income (whether or not such income is distributed). There also may be state or local tax withholding. Non-U.S. investors may also be subject to the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as amended, which generally treats any gain or loss of a non-U.S. person that is realized in connection with the (actual or constructive) disposition of a U.S. real property interest as gain or loss effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business engaged in by such non-U.S. person. Additionally, in the case of a non-U.S. unitholder that is a corporation, a U.S. "branch profits tax" of up to 30 will generally apply with respect to any such effectively connected income. 
 
 Risks related to the Investment Company Act 
 
 We are not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and, therefore, we will not be subject to the requirements imposed on an investment company by the Investment Company Act which may limit or otherwise affect our investment choices. 
 
 The Company and our subsidiaries will conduct our businesses so that none of such entities are required to register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act. Although we could modify our business methods at any time, at the present time we expect that the focus of our activities will involve investments in fixed-income assets and other loans of the nature described earlier. 
 
 Companies subject to the Investment Company Act are required to comply with a variety of substantive requirements including, but not limited to: 

limitations on the capital structure of the entity; 

restrictions on certain investments; 

prohibitions on transactions and restrictions on fees with affiliated entities; and 

public reporting disclosures, record keeping, voting procedures, proxy disclosures, board operations and similar corporate governance rules and regulations. 

These and other requirements are intended to provide benefits and/or protections to security holders of investment companies. Because we and our subsidiaries do not expect to be subject to these requirements, you will not be entitled to these benefits or protections. It is our policy to operate in a manner that will not require us to register as an investment company, and we do not expect or intend to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Whether a company is an investment company can involve analysis of complex laws, regulations and SEC staff interpretations. We intend to conduct the Company s operations so as not to become subject to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. So long as the Company conducts its businesses directly and through its wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that are not investment companies and none of the Company and the wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing in securities, the Company should not have to register. The securities issued by any subsidiary that is excepted from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities (as used in the Investment Company Act) its parent may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40 of the value of the parent entity s total assets on an unconsolidated basis (which we refer to as the 40 test). In other words, even if some interests in other entities were deemed to be investment securities, so long as such investment securities do not comprise more than 40 of an entity s assets, the entity will not be required to register as an investment company. If an entity held investment securities and the value of these securities exceeded 40 of the value of its total assets, and no other exemption from registration was available, then that entity might be required to register as an investment company. 
 
 We do not expect that we or any of our majority- or wholly-owned subsidiaries will be an investment company, and in particular, we will seek to assure that holdings of investment securities in the Company do not exceed 40 of the total assets of that entity as calculated under the Investment Company Act. In order to operate in compliance with that standard, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that takes account of these provisions. In order for us to so comply, we or a subsidiary could be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell or we may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain, if we deem it necessary to remain in compliance with the 40 test. In addition, we may also have to forgo opportunities to acquire certain assets or interests in companies or entities that we would otherwise want to acquire, or acquire assets we might otherwise not select for purchase, if we deem it necessary to remain in compliance with the 40 test. For example, these restrictions will limit our ability to invest directly in certain types of assets, such as in securities that represent less than 50 of the voting securities (as used in the Investment Company Act) of the issuer thereof. 
 
 If the Company or any subsidiary owns assets that qualify as investment securities as such term is defined under the Investment Company Act and the value of such assets exceeds 40 of the value of its total assets, the entity could be deemed to be an investment company. In that case the entity would have to qualify for an exemption from registration as an investment company in order to operate without registering as an investment company. Certain of the subsidiaries that we may form in the future could seek to rely upon one of the exemptions from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(A) or Section 3(c)(5)(B) of the Investment Company Act. The exemption pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(A) is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services (which we refer to as the 3(c)(5)(A) exemption), while the exemption pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(B) is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and services (which we refer to as the 3(c)(5)(B) exemption). Each of the 3(c)(5)(A) exemption and the 3(c)(5)(B) exemption generally requires that at least 55 of the assets of a subsidiary relying on such exemption be invested in eligible loans and receivables. To qualify for either of the foregoing exemptions, the subsidiary would be required to comply with interpretations issued by the staff of the SEC that govern the respective activities. 
 
 In addition to the exceptions discussed above, we and/or our subsidiaries may rely upon other exceptions and exemptions, including the exemptions provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act (which exempts, among other things, parent entities whose primary business is conducted through majority-owned subsidiaries relying upon the 3(c)(5)(A) exemption and/or the 3(c)(5)(B) exemption discussed above) from the definition of an investment company and the registration requirements under the Investment Company Act. 
 
 The laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of entities like the Company and our subsidiaries, including actions by the Division of Investment Management of the SEC providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, may change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exceptions discussed above or other exemptions from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act upon which we may rely, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. 
 
 If the Company or any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the additional expenses and operational limitations associated with such registration may reduce our unitholders investment return or impair our ability to conduct our business as planned. 
 
 If we become an investment company or are otherwise required to register as such, we might be required to revise some of our current policies, or substantially restructure our business, to comply with the Investment Company Act. This would likely require us to incur the expense of holding a unitholder meeting to vote on such changes. Further, if we were required to register as an investment company, but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, criminal and civil actions could be brought against us, some of our contracts might be unenforceable, unless a court were to direct enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.

Risks related to ERISA 
 
 If our assets are deemed to be plan assets for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), the Advisor and we may be exposed to liabilities under Title I of ERISA and the Code. 
 
 In some circumstances where employee benefit plans subject to ERISA or other plans subject to Section 4975 of the Code (together, ERISA Plans hold an equity interest in an entity, the assets of the entire entity are deemed to be plan assets unless the equity interest is a publicly-offered security or a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or another exception applies. This is known as the look-through rule. Under those circumstances, the obligations and other responsibilities of plan fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may be applicable to us. In particular, ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other parties who have a specified relationship with the ERISA Plan. We believe that our assets will not be treated as plan assets because our units should qualify as publicly-offered securities that are exempt from the look-through rules under applicable Treasury Regulations. We note, however, that because certain limitations are imposed upon the transferability of our units, it is possible that this exemption may not apply. If that is the case, and if the Advisor or we are deemed to hold plan assets, we may be exposed to liability under ERISA or the Code and our performance and results of operations could be adversely affected. Prior to making an investment in us, our unitholders should consult with their legal and other advisors concerning the impact of ERISA and the Code on our unitholders investment and our performance. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Units 
 
 The units sold will not be listed on an exchange for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, it will be difficult for our unitholders to sell their units and, if they are able to sell their units, they will likely sell them at a substantial discount. 
 
 Our units are illiquid assets for which there is not expected to be any secondary market nor is it expected that any will develop in the future. Moreover, our unitholders should not rely on our unit repurchase program as a method to sell units promptly because our unit repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that limit the unitholders ability to sell their units to us, and our board of managers may amend, suspend or terminate our unit repurchase program at any time. In particular, the unit repurchase program provides that we may make repurchase offers only if our unitholders have held our units for a minimum of one year, we have sufficient funds available for repurchase from our distribution reinvestment plan and to the extent the total number of units for which repurchase is requested in any 12 month period does not exceed 5 of our weighted average number of outstanding units as of the same date in the prior 12 month period. Therefore, it will be difficult for our unitholders to sell their units promptly or at all. We have not been able to fulfill all repurchase requests submitted during the year ended December 31, 2022 because they exceeded the limitations of the program and we have repurchased a pro rata amount of the unitholders requests. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. If our unitholders are able to sell their units, they may only be able to sell them at a substantial discount from the price they paid. Investor suitability standards imposed by certain states may also make it more difficult to sell units to someone in those states. 
 
 Although the Company has a perpetual duration, it disclosed previously that if the Company did not consummate a liquidity event by August 25, 2021, it would commence an orderly liquidation of its assets unless a majority of the board of managers, including a majority of the independent managers, determined that liquidation is not in the best interests of the Company s unitholders. Following the completion of a review process, in May 2021, the board of managers, including all of the independent managers, determined that a liquidation was not in the best interests of the Company s unitholders and approved the continuation of the Company s operations through at least August 26, 2022. In August 2022, the board of managers again determined that a liquidation is not in the best interests of the Company's unitholders. The board of managers and management believe that it is in the best interests of the Company's unitholders to continue its operations and to pursue leverage and other alternatives to stabilize the Company's portfolio and NAV

Our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, which makes investment in our units more speculative. 
 
 Our investments are selected by our sub-advisors and reviewed by our Advisor and our unitholders do not have input into such investment decisions, so our unitholders have to rely entirely on the ability of our Advisor and sub-advisors to select suitable and successful investment opportunities. Both of these factors will increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in units. 
 
 Our unitholders will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of their units equal to the offering costs associated with their units. 
 
 Our unitholders will incur immediate dilution, which will be substantial, equal to the costs of any offering associated with the sale of units. This means that the investors who have or will purchase units will pay a price per unit that substantially exceeds the amount available with which to purchase assets and therefore, the value of these assets upon purchase. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred a cumulative total of approximately 17.3 million in offering costs which has been reimbursed to our Sponsor. 
 
 Because of all the risks described in this section, investing in units may involve an above average degree of risk. 
 
 Because of all the risks described in this section, the investments we make in accordance with our investment objectives may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments may be highly risky and aggressive, and therefore, an investment in units may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance. 
 
 Our unitholders may experience dilution. 
 
 Our unitholders do not have preemptive rights. If, as expected, we engage in a subsequent offering of units or securities convertible into units, issue units pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan or otherwise issue additional units, investors who purchase units in this offering who do not participate in those other securities issuances will experience dilution in their percentage ownership of our outstanding units. Furthermore, unitholders may experience a dilution in the value of their units depending on the terms and pricing of any unit issuances and the value of our assets at the time of issuance. 
 
 The price for units redeemed pursuant to the Company s unit repurchase program and issued pursuant to the DRP is the most recently disclosed estimated NAV per unit for such class of units, which may not equal the actual NAV per unit at the time of repurchase or reinvestment. The estimated NAV per unit may not be an accurate reflection of the fair market value of the Company s assets and liabilities and likely will not represent the amount of net proceeds that would result if the Company liquidated or dissolved or the amount the Company s unitholders would receive upon the sale of their units. 
 
 The price for units redeemed pursuant to the Company s unit repurchase program and offered pursuant to the DRP is equal to the most recently disclosed estimated NAV per unit of such class of units, which may not equal the actual NAV per unit on the date of repurchase or reinvestment due to the lag between the timing of the most recent NAV disclosure and the redemption or reinvestment. In addition, the estimated NAV per unit, as determined by our management in accordance with our valuation policies, may not be an accurate reflection of the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP, may not reflect the price at which the Company would be able to sell all or substantially all of its assets or the outstanding units in an arm's length transaction, may not represent the value that the Company s unitholders could realize upon a sale of the Company or upon the liquidation of its assets and settlement of its liabilities, and may not be indicative of the price at which units would trade if they were listed on a national securities exchange. Further, our board of managers may determine the fair value of our assets completely or in part based upon internal valuation assessments and not independent valuation assessments, which may be materially different. In addition, the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates, which may not be accurate or complete. 
 
 We do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance. 
 
 We do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis. Therefore, our unitholders will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our units relative to publicly traded companies.

General Risk Factors 
 
 Terrorist attacks, military conflicts, acts of war or national disasters may affect any market for units, impact the businesses in which we invest, and harm our business, operating results and financial conditions. 
 
 Terrorist acts, military conflicts, including the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, acts of war or national disasters have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. This risk may be magnified in the case of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, due to the significant sanctions and other restrictive actions taken against Russia by the U.S. and other countries in response to Russia s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as well as the cessation of all business in Russia by many global companies. Future terrorist activities, civil war, military or security operations, or national disasters could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties in the regions in which we may invest, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks and national disasters are generally uninsurable. 
 
 The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. With increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and attacks becoming more frequent globally, we are more susceptible to operational and information security risks resulting from breaches in cyber security. The primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a successful cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our reputation and business relationships, and compromise or corruption of our confidential information. In addition, our third-party service providers including contractors, consultants, custodians, administrators, sub-advisors, borrower companies, suppliers with whom we conduct business are also subject to cyber security threats. In many cases, we have to rely on the controls and safeguards put in place by such third parties to defend against, respond to, and report these incidents, and we cannot provide any assurances that confidential information will not be compromised should they become exposed to a cyber security incident.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 
 Net Asset Value 
 
 There is no public trading market for our units. 
 
 We determine our net asset value on a quarterly basis. Our net asset value is determined by our board of managers based on the input of 1) our Advisor, 2) our audit committee, 3) an opinion of a third-party independent valuation firm as to the reasonableness of our internal estimates of fair value of selected loans and, 4) if engaged by our board of managers, one or more independent valuation firms. We may value our investments using different valuation approaches. We calculate our net asset value per unit by subtracting total liabiliti es from the total value of our assets on the date of valuation and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding units on the date of valuation. Our board of managers has determined our estimated net asset value, as of December 31, 2022 , to be approximately 5.92 per Class A, Class C, Class I, Class W, Class Y, and Class Z unit as compared to approximately 7.12 per Class A, Class C, Class I, Class W, Class Y, and Class Z unit as of December 31, 2021 . The decrease of approximately 1.20 in the estimated net asset value from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 resulted primarily due to the Company having recorded 34,855,545 in net change in unrealized depreciation on our investments during the year ended December 31, 2022 . Our net asset value would decrease for all unit classes in all prior periods if the Sponsor had not absorbed and deferred reimbursement for a substantial portion of our operating expenses since we began our operations. Our estimated net asset value was determined in accordance with the procedures set forth above. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the valuation of our investments. 
 
 We are offering up to 75 million in Class A, Class C and Class I units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan to the investors who have purchased units in the Offering. On March 7, 2018, our board of managers approved an amendment to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, pursuant to which units issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan are being offered at the price equal to the net asset value per unit of each class of units most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of reinvestment. Prior to the amendment of our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, units were issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan at a price equal to the greater of 9.025 per unit or the net asset value per unit of each class, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC. 
 
 As o f September 28, 2023, there were 18,303,923 Class A units outstanding held of record by 3,733 persons, 7,766,733 Class C units outstanding held of record by 1,893 persons, 10,576,284 Class I Units outstanding held of record by 1,929 persons, 24,555 Class W units outstanding held of record by four persons, 2,683,015 Class Y units outstanding held of record by 227 persons, and 8,423,851 Class Z units outstanding held of record by two persons. There were no outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, our units. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 We pay distributions pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement on a monthly basis when declared by our board of managers. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board. Distributions are subject to the board of managers discretion and applicable legal restrictions and accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to make distributions at a specific rate or at all. Generally, our policy is to pay distributions from cash flow from operations. However, our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from any source, including borrowings and offering proceeds, provided, however, that no funds will be advanced or borrowed for purpose of distributions, if the amount of such distributions would exceed our accrued and received revenues for the previous four quarters, less paid and accrued operating costs with respect to such revenues. We have not established a cap on the use of offering proceeds to fund distributions. If we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, we will have less funds available for investments and unitholders overall returns will be reduced. 
 
 Distributions are made on all classes of our units at the same time. The cash distributions received by our unitholders with respect to the Class C units, certain Class I units, and Class W units are and will continue to be lower than the cash distributions with respect to Class A and certain other Class I units because of the distribution fee relating to Class C units, an ongoing dealer manager fee with respect to certain Class I units and Class W units and an ongoing service fee with respect to Class W units, which is an expense specific to these units. The distributions paid with respect to these units will be lower until these ongoing fees are no longer payable. Amounts distributed to each class are allocated among the unitholders in such class in proportion to their units. Because the payment of such fees is not a deductible expense for tax purposes, the taxable income of the Company allocable to the Class C, certain Class I and Class W unitholders may, therefore, exceed the amount of cash distributions made to such unitholders. 
 
 Since July 2013, the Company has paid monthly distributions for all classes of units. For the yea rs ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , 16,577,785 and 18,030,422, respectively, of these distributions were paid in cash and 6,928,654 and 7,999,688, respectively, were reinvested in units for those unithold ers participating in the Company s amended and restated distribution reinvestment plan (the Distribution Reinvestment Plan ).

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold an aggre gate of 41,163 units of Class Y units to accredited investors for an aggregate gross amount of approximately 295,000. The units were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (t he Securities Act ), for transactions not involving a public offering. 
 
 Unit Repurchase Program 
 
 Beginning June 11, 2014, we commenced a unit repurchase program pursuant to which we conduct quarterly unit repurchases of up to 5 of our weighted average number of outstanding units in any 12-month period to allow our unitholders, who have held our units for a minimum of one year, to sell their units back to us. Our unit repurchase program includes numerous restrictions, including a one-year holding period, that limit our unitholders ability to sell their units. Additionally, we have no obligation to repurchase units if the repurchase would violate the restrictions on distributions under federal law or Delaware law, and all units to be repurchased under the program must be fully transferable and not be subject to any liens or other encumbrances and free from any restrictions on transfer. Unless our board of managers determines otherwise, we will limit the number of units to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of units we can repurchase with the proceeds we receive from the sale of units under our distribution reinvestment plan. At the sole discretion of our board of managers, we may also use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from liquidation of investments as of the end of the applicable quarter to repurchase units. 
 
 On August 9, 2019, our board of managers amended and restated our unit repurchase program in order to amend the basis on which we will honor repurchase requests in the event repurchase requests exceed the existing limitations of the program. The amended and restated unit repurchase program took effect on September 30, 2019. Under the amended and restated unit repurchase program, if we cannot repurchase all units presented for repurchase in any quarter because of the limitations on repurchases set forth in the program, then we will honor repurchase requests in the following order of priority (unless our board of managers determines that we will not repurchase units in that quarter): 

first , we will repurchase units pursuant to repurchase requests made in connection with the death or disability of a unitholder (or on a pro rata basis among such requests if less than all of such death or disability requests can be satisfied); 

second, we will repurchase units pursuant to any repurchase request that has been carried over from one or more previous quarterly periods where the value of the units that have not yet been repurchased pursuant to such request (with the value calculated as the number of units multiplied by the estimated net asset value per unit for units of that class, as most recently disclosed by us in a filing with the SEC) is less than 2,500 (or on a pro rata basis among such requests if less than all of such requests carried over from prior periods can be satisfied); and 

third , we will repurchase units pursuant to all other repurchase requests on a pro rata basis. 

Unit repurchases are made on the last calendar day of the quarter at a price equal to the estimated net asset value per unit for each class of units, as most recently disclosed by us in a public filing with the SEC. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had received and proces sed 396 repurchase requests. The Company repurchased an aggregate of 355,052 Class A units, 179,547 Class C units, 413,404 Class I units and 59,770 Class Y units for a total of 7,026,905. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had received and processed 363 repurchase requests. The Company repurchased an aggregate of 375,049 Class A units, 246,270 Class C units, 392,684 Class I units and 55,393 Class Y units for a total of 7,962,052. 
 
 Repurchases for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022 were repurchased at a price e qual to 7.123, 7.049, 6,899 and 6.838, resp ectively per unit, which was the net asset value per unit of each class as of December 31, 2021, March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, respectively, and the most recently disclosed net asset value per unit at the time of repurchase in each respective quarter. 
 
 Our board of managers has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the unit repurchase program to the extent that it determines that it is in our best interest to do so. We will promptly notify our unitholders of any changes to the unit repurchase program, including any amendment, suspension or termination of it in our periodic or current reports or by means of other notice. Moreover, the unit repurchase program will terminate on the date that our units are listed on a national securities exchange, are included for quotation in a national securities market or, in the sole determination of our board of managers, a secondary trading market for the units otherwise develops. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11. Subsequent Events" for information regarding the suspension of our unit repurchase program subsequent to December 31, 2022.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchas ed 259,671 units for a total of 1,770,333. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 , there were repurchase requests for a total of 259,530 units that were pending which were processed by the Company during January 2023 at a price of 6.838 per unit. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022 , eligible repurchase requests exceeded the limitations of our unit repurchase program described above and the requests were fulfilled on a pro rata basis, such that we repurchased approximately 246,000 units, or 6.07 of eligible repurchase requests through the quarterly repurchase program (based on the number of units submitted for repurchase), and approximately 3,686,000 units, or 93.93 of eligible repurchase requests (based on the number of units submitted for repurchase), were not redeemed. Pursuant to the terms of our unit repurchase program, the unsatisfied portion of repurchase requests that were not fulfilled at quarter-end were carried over to the next quarter and will be treated as a request for repurchase at the next quarter-end repurchase date, unless the repurchase request is withdrawn. 
 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 
 We have adopted the Distribution Reinvestment Plan pursuant to which our unitholders who have purchased Units in the Offering may elect to have the full amount of their cash distributions from us reinvested in additional units of the same class. On March 7, 2018, our board of managers approved an amendment to our distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which, commencing with distributions declared for the month of March 2018, units issued pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan are issued at the price equal to the net asset value per unit of each class of units, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of reinvestment. 
 
 Following the termination of the Offering, we have continued to offer units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan. Although there are no distribution fees that are paid for any Class C units sold pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, distribution fees have been and may be paid on an ongoing basis for Class C units sold pursuant to other Company offerings. Because distribution fees payable with respect to Class C units sold in other offerings are paid from and reduce the amount available for distribution on all Class C units, distributions will be reduced for Class C units purchased pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan. This will result in lower cash distributions with respect to the Class C units than the cash distributions with respect to Class A and certain Class I units. We may amend, suspend or terminate the distribution reinvestment plan at our discretion. 
 
 For the period from June 12, 2013 through December 31, 2022, we iss ued 8,023,485 units totaling approximately 65,836,000 of gross offering p roceeds pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11. Subsequent Events" for information regarding the suspension of our distribution reinvestment plan subsequent to December 31, 2022.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We make impact investments in SMEs that provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company on April 30, 2012. We have operated and intend to continue to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We use the proceeds raised from the issuance of units to invest in SMEs through local market sub-advisors in a diversified portfolio of financial assets, including direct loans, loan participations, convertible debt instruments, trade finance, structured credit and preferred and common equity investments. A substantial portion of our assets consists of collateralized private debt instruments, which we believe offer opportunities for competitive risk-adjusted returns and income generation. We are externally managed and advised by TriLinc Advisors, LLC, or the Advisor. The Advisor is an investment advisor registered with the SEC. 
 
 Our business strategy is to generate competitive financial returns and positive economic, social and environmental impact by providing financing to SMEs, which we define as those business having less than 500 employees, primarily in developing economies. To a lesser extent, we may also make impact investments in companies that may not meet our technical definition of SMEs due to a larger number of employees but that also provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. We generally expect that such investments will have similar investment characteristics as SMEs as defined by us. Our style of investment is referred to as impact investing, which J.P. Morgan Global Research and Rockefeller Foundation in a 2010 report called an emerging alternative asset class and defined as investing with the intent to create positive impact beyond financial return. We believe it is possible to generate competitive financial returns while creating positive, measurable impact. We measure the economic, social and environmental impact of our investments using industry-standard metrics, including the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards. Through our investments in SMEs, we intend to enable job creation and stimulate economic growth. 
 
 We commenced the Offering on February 25, 2013. Pursuant to the Offering, we were offering on a continuous basis up to 1.5 billion in units of our limited liability company interest, consisting of up to 1.25 billion of units in the primary offering consisting of Class A and Class C units at initial offering prices of 10.00 and 9.576 per unit, respectively, and Class I units at 9.025 per unit, and up to 250 million of units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan. SC Distributors, LLC, formally known as StratCap Securities, was the dealer manager for the Offering. In May 2012, the Advisor purchased 22,161 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of 200,000. On June 11, 2013, we satisfied the minimum offering requirement of 2,000,000 when the Sponsor purchased 321,330 Class A units for aggregate gross proceeds of 2,900,000 and we commenced operations. The Offering terminated on March 31, 2017. Through the termination of the Offering, we raised approximately 361,776,000 in gross proceeds, including approximately 13,338,000 raised through our Distribution Reinvestment Plan. 
 
 Upon termination of the primary portion of the Offering, we registered 75 million in Class A, Class C and Class I units to continue to be offered pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan to the investors who have purchased units in the Offering. Units issued pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan are offered at the price equal to the net asset value per unit of each class of units, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of reinvestment. Our Distribution Reinvestment Plan was amended, effective May 25, 2020, to allow holders of all classes of units other than Class Z units to participate, including holders who purchased units in our private placements. The offering must be registered or exempt from registration in every state in which we offer or sell units. If the offering is not exempt from registration, the required registration generally is for a period of one year. Therefore, we may have to stop selling units in any state in which the registration is not renewed annually and the offering is not otherwise exempt from registration. 
 
 From time to time we opportunistically seek to raise capital through sales of our common units in private placements that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, as amended (the Se curities Act ). 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 , we issued 986,369 of our units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan for gross proceeds of approximately 6,927,000 . In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022 , we issued 41,163 of our units for gross proceeds of approximately 295,000 pursuant to a private placement. As of December 31, 2022 , 22,502,000 in units remained available for sale pursuant to the Distribution Reinvestment Plan. See "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11. Subsequent Events" for information regarding the suspension of our distribution reinvestment plan subsequent to December 31, 2022. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 1,069,529 of our units pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan for gross proceeds of approximately 8,000,000. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 814,444 of our units for gross proceeds of approximately 6,106,000 pursuant to a private placement.

Table of Contents 

From our inception to December 31, 2022 , we have issued an aggregate of 56,246,000 of our units, including 8,023,485 units issued under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan, for gross proceeds of approximately 514,063,000 including approximately 65,836,000 reinvested under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (before dealer manager fees of approximately 4,800,000 and selling commissions of 16,862,000 ), for net proceeds of 492,401,000 . 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 
 The residual economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely impact many industries and businesses directly and indirectly. Adverse impacts have included disrupted global travel and supply chains, which have adversely impacted global commercial activity. Many businesses across the globe saw a downturn in production and productivity due to the suspension of business and temporary closure of offices and factories that was prevalent during most of 2020 and continued into 2021 in certain areas, including particularly in developing markets, in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. Although economic contractions associated with such suspensions and closures have subsided either in whole for most advanced economies or in part for most developing economies, the economic recovery has been significantly affected by impacts of supply chain disruptions, elevated input costs and cooling demand due to significantly rising interest rates. These issues have more acutely affected developing economies. Currently, the resulting macroeconomic and market condition impacts of COVID-19 are still affecting many of our borrowers. 
 
 The Company believes that most regions in which it invests are poised to achieve economic normalization once the supply chain disruptions, input cost increases and elevated interest rates dissipate. However, the Company expects economic recovery to be slower in Sub-Saharan Africa, where vaccination rates have been lower than in the rest of the world and the impact of COVID-19 is likely to impede economic recovery more so than in other regions. Any of these adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if COVID-19 cases began to spike again globally, it could further adversely impact the Company s borrowers businesses, financial condition and results of operations, which could result in their inability to make required payments in the near term and impact the fair value of the Company s investments. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made material adjustments to the fair value of certain of its investments, in part due to the resulting macroeconomic and market condition impacts of COVID-19. These adjustments, which amounted to a pproximately 5,895,000 and 6,368,000, respectively, in the aggregate during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were made with respect to 20.2 and 18.5 , respectively, of the Company s investm ents (calculated based on the aggregate fair value of the Company s total investments). 
 
 While many of the Company s borrowers' businesses have experienced some disruption related to COVID-19, degrees of effect have varied. For example, as indicated under Watch List Investments," below, the borrowers with respect to the investment added to the Watch List for the year ended December 31, 20 22 and three of the six investments added to the Watch List for the year ended December 31, 2021 have not made required payments in part due to adverse impacts they have experienced related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to the adverse impacts of supply chain disruptions, elevated input costs and cooling demand due to significantly rising interest rates. Where appropriate, the Company and/or the Company s sub-advisors are working with borrowers to restructure facilities and may restructure additional facilities to provide relief needed by certain borrowers, without necessarily providing concessions that are out of market. Due in part to the disruptions associated with COVID-19 as well as due to the supply chain disruptions, increased input costs and significantly rising interest rates, the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to continue to collect interest and principal payments at levels comparable to those prior to the pandemic. Further, the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to recover all past due amounts from delinquent borrowers. The economic uncertainty and disruption described above is expected to continue and the Company may see further defaults and additional investments may be added to the Watch List in subsequent quarters. The ongoing adverse economic impact of COVID-19 was one of the material contributors to the approximate 1.20 decline in our NAV per unit as of December 31, 2022, as compared to the Company s NAV per unit as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 The Company saw a significant decrease in the NAV per unit during the fourth quarter of 2022, with a NAV per unit of 5.92 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 7.12 as of December 31, 2021. The Company believes that this decrease reflects the fact that certain of the Company s positions that were already considered Watch List positions experienced a further decline throughout 2022, likely due to the compounded effects of three years of financial hardship that have made it difficult or impossible for some of our borrowers to recover, even as the effects of the pandemic on the global economy have improved. 
 
 In addition, the Company saw a slowdown in transaction volume due to the impact of the pandemic through most of 2021, as smaller SMEs and those in industries most affected by COVID-19 (travel and hospitality, retail sales, etc.) were no longer in a position to appropriately add debt capital, which made it more difficult to conduct in-person visits with potential borrowers. Transaction volume has increased over the last year, and the Company s ability to travel for in-person visits with subadvisors and potential borrowers is no longer adversely affected. Additionally, in future periods, the Company may hold higher levels of cash than before the pandemic to ensure it has sufficient cash available to meet its cash obligations. Uncertain or inconsistent deployment of capital or higher cash balances each have the potential to further reduce cash flow generated to cover the Company s distributions to its unitholders and/or cause the Company to further reduce its NAV in future periods.

Outlook 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering effects have adversely impacted many of the Company s borrowers both directly and indirectly. First, the adverse impact on the global supply chain, which was exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has been one of the largest challenges for our borrowers, as most of them are exporters whose income is directly tied to global trade. However, supply chain disruptions and goods shortages have improved throughout 2022, though the rate of commodity price normalization slowed in the fourth quarter. Second, our borrowers experienced challenges related to the decrease in global demand during 2020, 2021 and 2022, which decreased revenue for many of them. Additionally, input costs remain high and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries. The Company expects some of the regions in which it invests to achieve economic normalization once the lingering supply chain disruptions, input cost increases and elevated interest rates dissipate. However, the Company believes certain regions, industries and borrowers may experience further material economic distress due to the compound impact of more than three years of economic hardship and some borrowers may find it difficult or impossible to recover. If the continuing impacts of COVID-19, combined with rising input costs, further adversely affect borrowers businesses, financial condition and results of operations, borrowers may be unable to make required payments in the near term, which could impact the fair value of the Company s investments. 
 
 Economic conditions globally remain challenging, particularly for advanced economies due to the dramatic rise in interest rates. While inflation and rising interest rates are major issues in most advanced economies, the Company believes they are not core issues in the Company s markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, economic projections were relatively stable, with the notable exception of China, which struggled significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of its transition from its Zero Covid policy to a near-complete reopening. The Company continues to believe that the central issue driving results is that borrowers are struggling to recover from the compound impact of more than three years of economic hardship. Indeed, although the Company s NAV per unit modestly decreased by 1.20 as of December 31, 2022, compared to the NAV per unit as of December 31, 2021, the Company s NAV is a reflection of the cumulative effect of 12 consecutive quarters of the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 and its ramifications, including persistent supply chain and cash flow issues, on our borrowers. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Our investment objectives are to provide our unitholders current income, capital preservation, and modest capital appreciation. These objectives are achieved primarily through SME trade finance and term loan financing, while employing rigorous risk-mitigation and due diligence practices, and transparently measuring and reporting the economic, social and environmental impacts of our investments. The majority of our investments are senior and other collateralized loans to SMEs with established, profitable businesses in developing economies. To a lesser extent, we may also make investments in financing to companies that may not meet our technical definition of SMEs due, for example, to the companies having a larger number of employees, but that also provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. Furthermore, we may also make investments in developed economies, including the United States. With the sub-advisors that our Advisor has contracted with to assist the Advisor in implementing the Company s investment program, we expect to provide growth capital financing generally ranging in size from 5-20 million per transaction for direct SME loans and 500,000 to 15 million for trade finance transactions. We seek to protect and grow investor capital by: (1) targeting countries with favorable economic growth and investor protections; (2) partnering with sub-advisors with significant experience in local markets; (3) focusing on creditworthy lending targets who have at least 3-year operating histories and demonstrated cash flows enabling loan repayment; (4) making primarily debt investments, backed by collateral and borrower guarantees; (5) employing best practices in our due diligence and risk mitigation processes; and (6) monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. By providing additional liquidity to growing small businesses, we believe we support both economic growth and the expansion of the global middle class. 
 
 Investments will continue to be primarily credit facilities and participations in credit facilities to developing economy SMEs, including trade finance and term loans, through the Advisor s team of professional sub-advisors with a local presence in the markets where they invest. As of December 31, 2022 , more than a majority of our investments were in the form of participations and we expect that future investments will continue to be primarily participations. We typically provide financing that is collateralized, has a short to medium-term maturity and is self-liquidating through the repayment of principal. Our counterparty for participations generally will be the respective sub-advisor or its affiliate that originates the loan in which we are participating. We will not have a contract with the underlying borrower and therefore, in the event of default, we will not have the ability to directly seek recovery against the collateral and instead will have to seek recovery through our sub-advisor counterparty, which increases the risk of full recovery. 
 
 Certain investments, including loans and participations, may carry equity warrants on borrowers, which allow us to buy shares of the portfolio company at a given price, which we will exercise at our discretion during the life of the portfolio company. Our goal is to ultimately dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon the disposition of such interests. However, these warrants and equity interests are illiquid and it may be difficult for the Company to dispose of them. In addition, we expect that any warrants or other return enhancements received when we make or invest in loans may require several years to appreciate in value and may not appreciate at all. 
 
 LIBOR 
 
 In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority FCA announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022 into law, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, containing legislation related to the transition away from LIBOR. This legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of LIBOR and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. 
 
 LIBOR was phased out in June 2023, and new contracts ceased to be written using USD LIBOR at the beginning of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 11.3 of the fair value of the Company's total investments bore interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, with an alternative rate to be designated by the Company in the event that LIBOR is unavailable. 
 
 The Company's legacy loans transitioned from LIBOR to Synthetic LIBOR in July 2023 and this rate is expected to stay in effect until September 30, 2024. There can be no assurances as to whether this alternative rate will be more or less favorable than LIBOR. We intend to monitor the developments with respect to the phasing out of LIBOR and work with our sub-advisors to seek to ensure the transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our investments, but we can provide no assurances regarding the continuing impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR.

Revenues 
 
 Since we anticipate that the majority of our assets will continue to consist of trade finance instruments and term loans, we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be generated in the form of interest. Our senior and subordinated debt investments may bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semi-annually. In some cases, some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally is due at the maturity date. In addition, we generate revenue in the form of acquisition and other fees in connection with some transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of asset management fees and expenses reimbursable to our Advisor under the Advisory Agreement. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. 
 
 From our inception through December 31, 2017, under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement by and among us, the Advisor and the Sponsor (the Responsibility Agreement ), the Sponsor assumed substantially all our operating expenses. Our Sponsor did not assume any of our operating expenses subsequent to December 31, 2017. From the inception of the Company through December 31, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Responsibility Agreement, the Sponsor paid approximately 12,421,000 of operating expenses, asset management fees, and incentive fees on behalf of the Company and planned to reimburse to the Company an additional 4,240,231 of operating expenses, which had been paid by the Company as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we, the Sponsor and the Advisor agreed to terminate the Responsibility Agreement and extinguish all amounts due thereunder, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022. Please see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Responsibility Agreement and the agreement resulting in its termination, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022.

 Watch List Investments 
 
 The Company monitors and reviews the performance of its investments and if the Company determines that there are any significant changes in the credit and collection risk of an investment, the investment will be placed on the Watch List. The Company places an investment on the Watch List when it believes the investment has material performance weakness driven by company-specific and macro events that may affect the timing of future cash flows. For all Watch List investments, the Company evaluates: (i) liquidation value of collateral; (ii) rights and remedies enforceable against the borrower; (iii) any credit insurance and/or guarantees; (iv) market, sector and macro events and (v) other relevant information (e.g., third party purchase of the borrower and potential or ongoing litigation). At December 31, 2022, sixteen portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with an aggregate fair value of approximately 84,285,000 or 30.8 of the fair value of the Company s total investments. At December 31, 2021, nine portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with an aggregate fair value of approximately 25,393,000 or 8.4 of the fair value of the Company s total investments. Interest income not recorded relative to the original terms of the loans to the companies on non-accrual status amounted to approximately 3,804,000 and 1,585,000, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company had 22 and 17 Watch List investments.

Investments through Helios Investment Partners, LLP Helios as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 Trustco Group Holdings Ltd 
 
 In January 2017, the Company purchased a 15,000,000 Participation in a term loan facility with Trustco Group Holdings Ltd Trustco ), a Namibia based group operating a diversified set of business lines including property development, financial services (insurance, retail banking), education, and diamond mining. Repayment on this position has been slower than originally anticipated, largely due to a slowdown in the local real estate market. Helios has been actively working with the borrower to restructure the facility. As this has proved challenging, Helios issued a notice of default and acceleration notice to Trustco along with launching initial legal proceedings on April 15, 2020. A demand has also been made against Elisenheim as guarantor in respect of Trustco s obligations to Helios. In addition to recourse against Trustco, Helios has the benefit of a security interest in property owned by the guarantor. During the fourth quarter of 2021, an initial judgment was issued in Helios favor in the UK and Trustco appealed the court s decision and the requirements to deposit the full outstanding balance into an escrow account. This appeal was dismissed in February 2022 and we are now seeking enforcement of the UK judgment in Namibia, which is proceeding. The judge has ordered a pre-trial conference hearing to be held prior to March 2023. The fair value decreased by approximately 3,895,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the Namibian dollar weaking against the USD, thus affecting the potential value of the property collateral and additional financial weakness in Trustco. 
 
 Helios Maritime I 
 
 Between July 2015 and December 2017, the Company purchased six Participations totaling 15,300,000 in a term loan facility with Helios Maritime I Helios Maritime ), a company setup for the purposes of on-lending to Starz Investment Company, Ltd., a Nigerian shipping and logistics company for the purpose of acquiring a handling tug vessel. Repayment on this position has been slower than originally anticipated due to delays in acquiring a long-term contract, which was further prolonged based on challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility in oil prices. The borrower has pledged a marine vessel as collateral in support of its repayment obligations under this facility. 
 
 The borrower received a term sheet subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2021 to support its performance against its obligations, which requires an 8 million payment in exchange for a partial forgiveness of debt and restructured amortization profile. An extension was granted to the borrower to meet this requirement and while the borrower was able to secure a loan facility from a local bank for the payment, it was funded in Namibian naira, which is a difficult currency to convert to USD. Through the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 763,000 has been converted and paid; however, as the extension date has passed, a demand notice was sent to both the borrower and the guarantor during the third quarter of 2022. The Company continues to work with the borrower on payment of the 8 million and is currently in the late stages of securing the remaining naira in order to complete the restructuring. The delay in payment, conversion value of USD to naira and time value of money effects resulted in a negative valuation adjustment of approximately 926,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Investments through The International Investment Group L.L.C. IIG as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 IIG was the sub-advisor with respect to certain investments that the Company made in South America, including five of the 22 Watch List investments as of December 31, 2022. Since June 30, 2018, the Company has discovered, among other things, that IIG failed to provide the Company with complete and accurate information with respect to the investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor and, in 2017, sold the Company a 6 million participation in a loan to Nacadie (defined below) that did not exist. In November of 2019, the SEC charged IIG with fraud and revoked IIG s registration. Shortly thereafter, IIG ceased all operations. A fund managed by IIG, which sold most of the participations to the Company, was placed into bankruptcy in January 2020. Subsequently, the Company filed a bankruptcy claim against the remaining assets of the estate. 
 
 The SEC charged IIG with fraud on November 21, 2019 and revoked IIG's registration as an investment adviser on November 26, 2019. On March 30, 2020, the SEC obtained a final judgment on consent that enjoins IIG from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. On July 17, 2020, the SEC filed fraud charges against David Hu, one of IIG's co-founders, who was also charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in a parallel criminal action. On January 28, 2021, David Hu pled guilty to one count of securities fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. On April 13, 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced that Martin Silver, IIG's other co-founder, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit investment adviser fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of wire fraud for his role in overvaluing and selling fake loans to investors so IIG could collect management and performance fees. Also on April 13, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Martin Silver, asserting several claims that involve allegations of a string of frauds perpetrated by Mr. Silver and others at IIG in order to keep IIG afloat. IIG has ceased operations and the Company does not expect to receive any further reporting from IIG with respect to its outstanding investments. The Company is taking necessary steps, including legal action in some cases, in order to ascertain as much information as possible regarding these investments. 
 
 Most of the outstanding investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor were purchased from IIG TOF B.V., a Dutch Limited Liability Company advised by IIG. On December 11, 2019, a subsidiary of the Company filed an application in Amsterdam District Court to declare IIG TOF B.V. bankrupt. As set forth in the application for the Declaration of Bankruptcy, the Company and other creditors believe they have multiple due and payable claims against IIG TOF B.V. which IIG TOF B.V. has acknowledged it is unable to pay. On January 21, 2020, the Amsterdam District Court declared IIG TOF B.V. bankrupt and appointed a Dutch law firm as liquidator. The Company is seeking recovery of amounts due and payable to the Company with respect to the Participations it acquired from IIG TOF B.V. There can be no assurances as to when or if the Company will recover the amounts to which the Company believes it is entitled. Additional information regarding Watch List investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor with a fair value equal to or greater than 1.0 of the Company's net assets as of December 31, 2022 is presented below. 
 
 Compania Argentina de Granos 
 
 Between October 2016 and February 2017, the Company purchased two Participations in a trade finance facility originated by IIG TOF B.V., with Compania Argentina de Granos CAGSA ), as borrower. The Company purchased the initial Participation in October 2016 for 10,000,000 and subsequently increased the Participation by another 2,500,000 in February 2017. This facility was collateralized by two export contracts. CAGSA, an Argentine company, is mainly engaged in the trading of grain and oilseed and the distribution and processing of food ingredients. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, CAGSA was unable to make delivery of toasted soybean meal under the terms of its export contracts. As a result, it failed to pay IIG its outstanding principal due on June 30, 2018. 
 
 IIG previously informed the Company that it had been in active discussions with CAGSA and other CAGSA lenders to protect its rights under the credit facility. Additionally, IIG had previously informed the Company that IIG is a member of the creditors committee, which would determine all financial and restructuring options of CAGSA, which may include additional equity infusions by the existing shareholders. In February 2019, CAGSA disclosed that it had reached a preliminary settlement with its creditors. The administrator of IIG TOF B.V. s bankruptcy proceedings in the Netherlands notified the Company that the settlement discussions with CAGSA s creditors had resumed and were close to being finalized. The administrator indicated that the terms of the settlement being discussed are different from the terms that had been part of the preliminary settlement that had been reached in February 2019. The settlement is expected to result in the assumption of the entirety of CAGSA s debt by its parent company, Molinos Ca uelas MolCa ), with a portion to be repaid over a ten-year period and the remaining portion to be repaid over a period of up to ten years from the proceeds of the sale of 62.5 of the outstanding interests in MolCa, which are expected to be pledged to the unsecured creditors of CAGSA and MolCa as part of the proposed settlement. The proposed changes to the settlement terms were less favorable to the Company with respect to its Participations than the terms of the preliminary settlement that had been reached in February 2019 (but was never finalized) and therefore, had a negative impact on the valuation of this investment, resulting in a reduction of approximately 3,907,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. On September 27, 2021, MolCa and CAGSA filed for debt restructuring in the Argentinian bankruptcy court. On March 11, 2022, IIG TOF BV filed claims on behalf of the Company for the court to recognize the amounts due. The terms of the restructuring had been widely pre-approved by the creditors group prior to the filing. Therefore, the Company does not expect significant changes to the restructuring plan other than a delay in its implementation to the end of 2023. 
 
 Frigorifico Regional Industrias Alimentarias, S.A., Sucursal Uruguay and Algodonera Avellaneda S.A. 
 
 Between June 2016 and July 2016, the Company purchased two Participations in a trade finance facility originated by IIG TOF B.V., with Frigorifico Regional Industrias Alimentarias, S.A., Sucursal Uruguay FRIAR ), an Argentine company that produces, processes and exports beef, as the borrower. In June 2017, IIG called a technical event of default due to non-payment by FRIAR. In an effort to seek repayment from FRIAR, IIG filed the promissory notes for FRIAR in the commercial court in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
 
 In March 2017, the Company purchased a Participation in a trade finance facility originated by IIG TOF B.V., with Algodonera Avellaneda S.A. Algodonera as the borrower for 6,000,000. The loan agreement states that Vicentin has guaranteed the payments to be made by Algodonera under the facility. Algodonera is an Argentinian vertically integrated cotton business. IIG informed the Company that in June 2017, IIG called a technical default on Algodonera under the facility due to nonpayment of interest and on Vicentin under the payment guarantee due to the breach of informational covenants. Thereafter, IIG made a filing against Vicentin and Algodonera in the commercial court in Buenos Aires, Argentina on July 4, 2017. 
 
 In August 2019, the Company was informed by IIG s legal counsel that the commercial court proceedings with FRIAR and Algodonera had been terminated due to the parties having reached a settlement. The Company obtained evidence that the settlement proceeds for all participant holders had been placed in an escrow account with a New York law firm. In January 2022, the largest participant holder with respect to claims against the escrow account filed an action in New York district court to release these funds to all the participant holders. In August of 2023, the court awarded the Company 4.6 million in proceeds from the escrow account.

Sancor Cooperativas Unidas Limitada 
 
 In April 2016 the Company purchased two Participations in a trade finance facility originated by IIG TOF B.V., with Sancor Cooperativas Unidas Limitada Sancor ), an Argentine company that distributes dairy products, as the borrower. IIG had worked with Sancor to restructure the existing loan and extended the maturity to July 29, 2019, with an annual renewal option. Since February 2019, Sancor has announced the sale of certain of its assets, which allowed it to make some payments to creditors and maintain operations, but the Company has not received any payment as a result of those asset sales. As noted above, IIG has ceased operations and the Company has taken legal action in an attempt to recover amounts due. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Company learned, in connection with certain court proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York regarding a fund advised by IIG, that funds had been received in a New York bank account controlled by an affiliate of IIG and that such funds may include prior debt service payments by Sancor related to the Company s interests in the Sancor trade finance facility. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company was able to obtain control of the assets in the bank account and determined that they should primarily be allocated to outstanding interest. Sancor is engaged in ongoing negotiations with its lenders regarding a debt restructuring, including discussions with the administrator of IIG TOF B.V. s bankruptcy proceedings in the Netherlands. The Company is continuing to actively monitor this process and seek an assignment of the rights to the loans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received interest payments of approximately 700,000 and principal payments of approximately 198,000 from the borrower. 
 
 IIG Trade Opportunities Fund B.V. Receivable 
 
 In March 2017, the Company purchased a Participation from IIG TOF B.V. in what the Company at that time believed to be a trade finance facility originated by IIG TOF B.V., with Nacadie Commercial S.A. Nacadie as the borrower. The Company purchased the Participation in March 2017 for 6,000,000. In connection with the Company s review of this investment during the third quarter of 2018, IIG informed the Company that IIG had misapplied the funds the Company had transmitted at the time the Company made this investment. As a result, IIG offered to refund the Company s investment amount, including all accrued interest. However, IIG did not repay the Company for this Participation. As noted above, the Company knows that the Nacadie facility in which it purchased this Participation did not exist and the Company considers this asset to be a receivable from IIG TOF B.V. rather than a Participation in a trade finance facility. 
 
 As noted above, IIG TOF B.V. has been declared bankrupt in the Netherlands, and the Company is seeking to recover amounts to which it is entitled through the bankruptcy proceedings. The Company has applied a discount to the fair value based on the risk created by the uncertainty of the ultimate resolution of the Company s attempt to recover amounts to which it is entitled through the bankruptcy proceedings in the Netherlands. 
 
 Investments through TransAsia Private Capital Ltd. TransAsia as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 Triton Metallics Pte. Ltd. 
 
 In November 2019, the Company made an investment in Triton Metallics Pte. Ltd. Triton totaling 16,456,270 in a trade finance facility. Triton is a Singapore based diversified commodities trading company. TransAsia informed the Company in early 2020 that due to the COVID-19 pandemic there have been constrained trading volumes. As a result, TransAsia then began working with the borrower to restructure the facility and a restructuring agreement was executed on August 17, 2020. We further amended the facility in June 2021, which reduced the interest rate from 11.5 to 6 PIK-only for a period of two years, in order to give Triton additional flexibility as it manages its business amidst the resurgence of the pandemic in Asia. The unpaid interest of 1,503,463 under the old trade finance facility has been capitalized and added to the outstanding principal balance as of the date of the new agreement. During the period of July 1, 2020 through August 16, 2020, 241,816 of interest income was recognized prior to the date the loan was restructured. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the borrower was able to modestly increase its trading business and is expected to resume debt service to the Company in late 2023. 
 
 Conplex International Ltd. 
 
 Between November 2018 and May 2019, the Company purchased three Participations totaling 9,500,000 in a trade finance facility with Conplex International Ltd. Conplex ), a Hong Kong-based international open market distributor and wholesaler of electronics products. TransAsia had informed the Company that the borrower had a large portion of receivables overdue from a large off-taker. Subsequently, TransAsia began to actively work with the borrower to restructure the facility. While the restructuring was still progressing, TransAsia, after its regular search and review process, found that a winding-up petition was filed and approved on October 7, 2020. TransAsia immediately notified the Company while a court-appointed provisional liquidator took control of Conplex. On October 14, 2020, TransAsia appointed a receiver to enforce its rights under the secured facility. The facility is secured by a lien on four properties, accounts receivable and two personal guarantees. Deloitte was subsequently appointed as liquidator and has transferred the keys to the mortgaged properties to the receiver. One property was sold in the fourth quarter of 2021, with approximately 596,000 of interest payments received by the Company. Two other properties were sold in January 2022, with approximately 716,000 of interest payments and approximately 67,000 of principal payments received by the Company. A sale and purchase agreement was executed for the remaining property in March 2022 and closed in April 2022, with approximately 361,000 received by the Company. Given that this is a secured facility with the Company in liquidation, it has been valued using the collateral based approach to arrive at the estimated fair value. The Company's ability to collect under the guarantee is in question based on the statement of affairs filed with the bankruptcy trustee, and one of the two guarantors was forced into bankruptcy during the three months ended June 30, 2021. A funds tracing exercise regarding loan disbursements determined there are minimal additional potential sources of recovery, resulting in a reduction in fair value of 1,643,088 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Vikudha Malaysia Sdn Bhd 
 
 In March 2017, the Company provided a 15,000,000 term loan facility to Vikudha Malaysia Sdn Bhd Vikudha ). Vikudha is a trading and manufacturing company, founded in 2007, principally involved in procurement of fast-moving consumer goods and agricultural related products. The borrower company had strong performance through year-end 2019 and then was significantly impacted by COVID-19 and was unable to meet scheduled debt repayments due to commence. The facility was successfully restructured in November 2020, and able to service the debt until there was a resurgence of the pandemic in the Asia region and global supply chains continued to be disrupted. In June 2021, a six-month final maturity extension was granted to June 2023. During the second quarter of 2022, the local office of one of Vikudha s local bank lenders filed a winding up petition against the company s Hong Kong-based parent company and loan guarantor. The wind-up petition has been postponed until November 2022 and is currently in the early stages of judicial process; however, based on the possibility of an enforcement, the Company issued a Reservation of Rights Letter to Vikudha in June 2022. In August 2022, the Company issued an Acceleration Notice to the borrower and Demand Notices to Corporate and Personal Guarantors. Once the winding up petition was granted by the Hong Kong court, the Company also filed proof of debt forms at the Hong Kong Receiver office to ensure legal rights are protected while continuing to work with the borrower on repayment of the debt. The borrower continues to seek additional equity and working capital as part of its efforts to rebuild its trading volumes; however, as this process has delayed the probability of more negative scenarios, including ultimate liquidation, have increased resulting in a reduction in fair value of 6,638,520 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Limas Commodities House Limited 
 
 In August 2017, the Company provided a 15 million senior secured term loan facility to Limas Commodities House Limited Limas ), a Hong Kong-based company 100 owned by an Indonesian entrepreneur. Limas was established as a financing SPV for PT Limas Tunggal, an Indonesian resource trader, for the purpose of gaining better access to international banking and capital markets. As a resource trading company, demand for Limas products were significantly affected by the global pandemic, reflected in lower shipping volume in 2020 and early 2021. The Company s sub-advisor provided 6 million of working capital to Limas, which secured additional collateral for the sub-advisor and the Company in the form of assignment of three claims won in Korean cases totaling 15,000,000. The collateral was assigned pro-rata, adding 13.4 million to the Company s existing collateral pool. Due to the continued impact of COVID-19, in June 2020, the Company executed an extension of final maturity to June 2023. Subsequent to June 30, 2022, PT Limas Tunggal, the corporate guarantor of the Company s facility, entered restructuring legal proceedings in Indonesia, and as a result, the Company issued an Acceleration Notice to the borrower and a Demand Notice to the Guarantor. The restructure legal proceedings concluded during the third quarter of 2022 which extended repayment of the debt and reduced the future interest rate from 11.5 to 10 . The borrower has progressed slowly towards materially ramping up its trading activity, with expectation of active shipments taking place in the second half of 2023. The borrower has progressed slowly towards materially ramping up its trading activity as the licensing for outputs have been delayed in the court process; however active shipments are expected in the first half of 2024. As a result of all of the above, a negative valuation adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 6.6 million was recognized. 
 
 Investments through Scipion Capital, Ltd. Scipion as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 Producam SA 
 
 Between March 2018 and June 2018, the Company purchased three Participations totaling 15,986,369 in a trade finance facility with Producam SA Producam ), a Cameroon based cocoa and coffee exporter, as the borrower. Repayment on these Participations has been slower than originally anticipated due to short run cash flow pressure on Producam. The original sub-advisor for this facility was Africa Merchant Capital Group AMC ). In the third quarter of 2018, AMC informed the Company that the borrower misapplied the proceeds from the sale of certain of its inventory to finance its own cash flow needs rather than repay the facility. AMC then began working with the borrower to restructure the facility to recover amounts due. In April 2021, Scipion replaced AMC as the sub-advisor with respect to Producam and has agreed to undertake efforts to liquidate the collateral underlying the facility in order to recover amounts due to the Company and the restructuring process is finalized. Under the new agreement, the loan was restructured with the interest rate reduced from 17.5 to 9.5 for the cocoa facility and 6.0 for the coffee facility retroactively to January 1, 2019. As part of the restructure, the Company included a PIK component which increased the principal amount. The fair value as a percentage of face value decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to collections from completed cocoa and coffee shipments being slower than anticipated resulting in further decline in fair value amounting to approximately 967,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022. As all interest was capitalized as part of the amendment, no interest remains outstanding as of the date of the new agreement. During the period from April 1, 2021 through April 14, 2021 (the date the loan was restructured), 49,014 of interest income was recognized. The Company is continuing to work with the borrower to process and sell the remaining coffee, as well as pursuing an arbitration settlement with the collateral manager. 
 
 Mac Z Group SARL 
 
 Between July 2016 and April 2017, the Company purchased nine Participations totaling 9,000,000 in a trade finance facility with Mac Z Group SARL Mac Z ), a scrap metal recycler, as the borrower. Mac Z is located in Morocco. The primary collateral securing this Participation was 1,970 tons of copper scrap. In late October 2017, Scipion s designated collateral manager for Mac Z notified Scipion of an investigation into a 1,820 ton, approximately 13.3 million, shortage of copper scrap inventory physically held in the warehouse. The copper scrap is pledged to the Company and serves as the primary collateral for this Participation. The missing inventory led the Company to place Mac Z on the Watch List and on non-accrual status. 
 
 In addition to conducting its investigation, Scipion issued an event of default and has taken steps to enforce the corporate guarantee, personal guarantee and relevant pledges made for the benefit of Scipion with respect to the facility, which include two insurance policies. Scipion has placed a blocking notice on all of Mac Z s bank accounts and has requested a freeze order from the Moroccan local courts on the physical assets of the company. Since the initial discovery and actions, Mac Z sold remaining inventory and the Company was paid interest of approximately 330,000 in January 2018 and 292,000 during the first week April 2018. 
 
 A judgment was received on December 18, 2017, in English court ordering the borrower and the corporate guarantor to make payment. In parallel to its recovery plan with respect to Mac Z, Scipion informed the Company that it has received a judgment in its favor with respect to its claim against the collateral manager under its professional indemnity insurance policy, which covers up to 40 million in losses. During the fourth quarter of 2020, 9,377,199 from a settlement under this insurance policy was received by the Company. The policy covered the copper scrap that was lost. The remaining copper scrap is being stripped and processed and currently expected to cover its principal value. The Company received approximately 27,000 in proceeds from the sale of the copper scrap during the first quarter of 2022 and continues to pursue options for sale of the remaining copper scrap. 
 
 Investments through Barak Fund Management Ltd. Barak as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 Multiple ICD (Kenya) Limited 
 
 In July 2017, the Company purchased a 15,000,000 Participation in a term loan facility with Multiple ICD (Kenya) Ltd ("MICD"), an inland container depot storage and warehousing company. Repayment on this position has been slower than originally anticipated due initially to unfavorable local industry dynamics at the Port of Mombasa, which were further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Barak has been actively seeking to restructure the loan facility with MICD and its other lenders. However, the loan is no longer on standstill as the lenders are requiring additional progress in order to renew it. The additional uncertainty regarding the lenders group s willingness to restructure the loan has increased the probability that MICD may be liquidated. As a result, a negative valuation adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 8.6 million was recognized. 
 
 Applewood Trading 199 (Pty) Ltd. 
 
 In July 2014, the Company purchased a Participation in a trade finance facility originated by Barak, with Applewood Trading 199 (Pty) Ltd. Applewood ), a South African company that processes and imports nuts and dried fruit. Repayment on this position has been slower than originally anticipated due initially to unfavorable local industry dynamics. Despite the fact that Barak has been actively seeking to restructure the loan facility with Applewood, the position did not yield the expected returns and was deemed unlikely to do so in the future. Therefore, the Company decided to stop accruing interest in the first quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Applewood was sold and only distributed approximately 51,000 to the Company, and the remaining unamortized cost was written off from the book.

Investments through Origin Capital Ltd. Origin as the Sub-Advisor 
 
 Agilis Partners 
 
 In 2018, the Company originally provided financing totaling approximately 10,968,000 to Agilis Partners ("Agilis"), a Ugandan company engaged in the farming, storage, processing, and trading of maize, soybean, and sunflower seeds through Scipion. This financing was refinanced into a new loan through Origin in July 2021 as part of a broader financial restructuring. Repayment on the facility has been slower than originally anticipated due to ongoing liquidity challenges of the borrower, as well as record drought conditions in Uganda, which resulted in a decline in fair value of 1,343,000 to account for increased credit risk associated with the position during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company and Origin agreed to a deferral of Agilis March 2022 interest payment, and are actively working with the borrower on solutions to increase working capital, manage other creditor relationships and improve the overall financial condition of the borrower. 
 
 Other Investments 
 
 Usivale Industria E Commercio Ltda 
 
 In December 2013, the Company made an investment in Usivale Industria E Comercio, Ltda. Usivale ), a sugar processing company located in Brazil, comprised of two senior secured term loans for an aggregate loan amount of 2,500,000. During 2016, Usivale entered into a judicial recovery process that resulted in an approved repayment plan on October 7, 2016. The Company received regular annual interest payments for 2017 and 2018. Unfortunately, Usivale continued to have challenges and was not able to make any payments thereafter. Usivale is currently not complying with the payment obligations under the above mentioned judicial recovery process. The Company has been negotiating a potential restructuring of the loan to support the sustainability of Usivale, including engaging industry and financial consultants to that effect. The judge responsible for the bankruptcy proceedings of Usivale has asked the Company and Usivale to seek an agreement on a potential restructuring to be submitted to a creditors meeting to be held in June 2022. The judge overseeing the judicial restructuring urged Usivale and the Company to come to an agreement to avoid liquidation of the company. Usivale and the Company completed a settlement agreement in the second quarter of 2022. Terms of the settlement require Usivale to make an upfront payment of 10,000 and 200,000 per year for 5 years, for expected repayments totaling 1,010,000. The new settlement agreement requires assignment of new collateral that would shift the repayment risk to a receivable from SucDen, one of the world's largest traders of sugar. As the SucDen contract is Usivale's most important, execution risk on the settlement amount is expected to be lower. The first partial installment was received on January 19, 2023. 
 
 TriLinc Peru S.A.C. (formerly known as Kinder Investments, Ltd.) 
 
 In December 2018, as part of a restructuring, TriLinc assigned its loan exposure in Corporacion Prodesa S.R.L. to Kinder Invsetments, Ltd. Kinder ), a private equity investment vehicle. After a successful start with new ownership in 2019, the borrower faced significant obstacles associated with loss of business volume due to point of sale closings due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent rising raw material prices, challenging operating performance. From the onset of the pandemic through most of 2022, Kinder continued supporting the business with shareholder capital. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Kinder agreed to a settlement with the Company for consensual enforcement of the Company s collateral, principally real estate, as part of a distressed sale whereby Kinder sold the underlying operating company, Prodesa, to another party. 
 
 Going forward, the Company owns a Peruvian company, TriLinc Peru S.A.C., which itself owns the real estate previously held as collateral under the prior loan agreement and is receiving monthly rental income. In recognition of the settlement and consensual collateral enforcement, a decline in the fair value of 1,387,430 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Ecsponent Holdings, Ltd. 
 
 In December 2017, TriLinc made a 4.74 million investment in Ecsponent Holdings, Ltd. Ecsponent to finance SMEs and provide fee-based services to entrepreneurs based in Botswana through the borrower s Business Credit Unit. Subsequently, during the third quarter of 2020, Ecsponent announced that its board of directors had launched a forensic investigation into the use of proceeds for various financial transactions executed by its former management, including the Company s investment. The combination of misapplied financing transactions and significant poor performance by other business units of the group, caused Ecsponent to seek deferment of its interest payments while it sought additional fund raising to financial and liquidity challenges, which the Company granted in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, the Covid-19 pandemic economic environment delayed several of the borrower s plans and initiatives. 
 
 Throughout the first three quarters of 2022, the Company worked closely with the CEO of the group of companies, which Ecsponent is a part of, and several of its existing creditors as part of a potential restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2022, and including subsequent events through the first quarter of 2023, one of the key companies in the borrower s group was placed into judicial management, which materially increased the risk of liquidation for itself and Ecsponent. The Company remains in close contact with Ecsponent s CEO, the group s creditors and judicial administrators in Bostwana to reach a settlement, which the Company expects to progress in future quarters. As a result the significantly increased risk of creditor actions which could lead to a liquidation of Ecsponent, a negative valuation adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately 3.2 million was recognized.

 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, total investment income amoun ted to 27,311,870 and 36,456,885 , respectively. Interest income decreased by approximately 9,145,000 during 2022 , primarily due to the annualized impact of certain non-performing positions having been previously put on non-accrual status, credit loss from interest receivable and more non-performing positions that were newly put on non-accrual status in 2022.

During the ye ar ended December 31, 2022 , 13,812,090 or 50.6 of the interest income earned came from loan and trade finance participations and 13,496,298 or 49.4 came from direct loans. In addition, we earned 3,481 in interest incom e on our cash balances. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, 22,057,685 or 60.6 of the interest income earned came from loan and trade finance participations and 14,357,263 or 39.4 came from direct loans. In addition, we earned 41,937 in interest income on our cash balances. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Total operating expenses, excluding the asset management and incentive fees, incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 i ncreased approximately by 6,846,000 to 11,850,841 from 5,004,649 for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase was primarily due to (i) a write-off of due from affiliates in the amount of approximately 4,240,000 and (ii) an increase in professional fees of approximately 2,723,000 which was primarily driven by more fees incurred for legal and audit services in connection with the financial statement audit and arrangements under the credit facilities. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the asset management fees amounted to 6,489,991 and 7,065,751 , respectively. The incentive fees for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to 3,151,543 and 3,320,467 respectively. The decrease in incentive fees is primarily due to the decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 . 
 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments . 
 
 We measure net realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale of an investment and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized upfront fees. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment fair market values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. We recorded realized losses of 4,417,913 and 4,008,719 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 . We recorded net change in unrealized losses of 34,855,845 and 13,643,894 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The realized and unrealized losses were primarily driven by macro events, including the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the future cash flows generated by our investments as well as the ultimate realization of the underlying collateral. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14.5 million in cash. We generate cash primarily from cash flows from interest, dividends and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments, proceeds from sales of our investments and from sales of promissory notes, proceeds from issuance of notes payable, and proceeds from private placements of our units. We may also generate cash in the future from debt financing. Our primary use of cash will be to make loans, either directly or through participations, payments of our expenses, payments on our notes and any other borrowings, and cash distributions to our unitholders. We expect to maintain cash reserves from time to time for investment opportunities, working capital and distributions. 
 
 The following discussions provide additional detail regarding our cash flows. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 21.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of a decrease of 44.8 million in the purchase of investments versus the prior year. This was partially offset by a decrease of 24.7 million in the proceeds from disposition of investments. These changes reflected the increased liquidity challenges impacting our portfolio during 2022. Additionally, management and incentive fees paid during the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the decline of investment income compared to the prior year. 
 
 Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, decreased by 14.2 million compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of 17.0 million received from the issuance of a new note payable during 2022. There was no change in notes payable for the year ended December 31, 2021. However, the decrease was partially offset by the reduction of 5.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of new shares during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. Additionally, cash used in financing activities decreased during 2022 due to less distributions having been paid to unitholders in 2022 compared to 2021. This is a result of the decline in the Company s NAV during 2022. 
 
 Debt Financings and Financing Obligations 
 
 We may borrow additional funds to make investments. We have not decided to what extent going forward we will finance portfolio investments using debt or the specific form that any such financing would take, but we believe that obtaining financing is necessary for us to fully achieve our long-term goals. We have been, and still are, actively seeking further financing through both development banks and several commercial banks. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection with any such arrangement. On August 7, 2017, TGIFC issued 5 million in the first of a Series 1 Senior Secured Promissory Notes private offering to State Street Australia Ltd ACF Christian Super Christian Super ). On December 18, 2018, TGIFC issued 5 million of Series 2 Senior Secured Promissory Notes to Christian Super. TGIFC repaid the CS Note in full in January 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a transaction with an unrelated financial institution, whereby, it sold a 5.0 million participation interest in one of its term loan positions and agreed to repurchase the participation 135 days after the transaction date at a price equal to the sum of the original sales price plus accrued interest calculated at a simple 10 annualized rate. On November 22, 2022, TGIFC entered into two Facility Agreements (the "Facility Agreements") with DEG - Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH ("DEG") and BlueOrchard Microfinance Fund ("BlueOrchard") as Lenders . Pursuant to the Loan Documents, each of DEG and BlueOrchard will provide a loan with a principal amount of up to 25 million, for an aggregate principal amount of up to 50 million (the Credit Facility ). As of December 31, 2022 , we had 17 million in total debt outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, with a debt to equity ratio of 6.0 . As of September 1, 2023, we had no debt outstanding.

Company Strategy 
 
 Although the Company has a perpetual duration, it disclosed previously that if the Company did not consummate a liquidity event by August 25, 2021, it would commence an orderly liquidation of its assets unless a majority of the board of managers, including a majority of the independent managers, determined that liquidation is not in the best interests of the Company s unitholders. Following the completion of a review process, in May 2021, the board of managers, including all of the independent managers, determined that a liquidation was not in the best interests of the Company s unitholders and approved the continuation of the Company s operations through at least August 26, 2022. In August 2022, the board of managers again determined that a liquidation is not in the best interests of the Company's unitholders. The board of managers and management believe that it is in the best interests of the Company's unitholders to continue its operations and to pursue leverage and other alternatives to stabilize the Company's portfolio and NAV through December 31, 2023. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 We have paid distributions commencing with the month beginning July 1, 2013, and we intend to continue to pay distributions on a monthly basis. From time to time, we may also pay interim distributions at the discretion of our board. Distributions are subject to the board of managers discretion and applicable legal restrictions and accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will make distributions at a specific rate or at all. Distributions are made on all classes of our units at the same time. The cash distributions received by our unitholders with respect to the Class C units, Class W units and certain Class I units, are and will continue to be lower than the cash distributions with respect to Class A and certain other Class I units because of the distribution fee relating to Class C units, the ongoing dealer manager fee relating to Class W units and Class I units issued pursuant to a private placem ent and the ongoing service fee relating to the Class W units, which are expenses specific to those classes of units. Amounts distributed to each class are allocated among the unitholders in such class in proportion to their units. Distributions are paid in cash or reinvested in units, for those unitholders participating in the Distribution Reinvestment Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , we paid a total of 23,506,439 in distributions, comprised of 16,577,785 paid in cash and 6,928,654 reinvested under our Distribution Reinvestment Plan.

Legal Proceedings 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company was not a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income/loss and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of managers. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments during year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from these estimates. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact the Company's business, the businesses of the Company's borrowers and the global markets generally. The full extent to which the pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including fair value measurements, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. These developments include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or address its impact, governmental actions to contain the spread of the pandemic and respond to the reduction in global economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company records interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. The Company does not accrue as a receivable interest on loans for accounting purposes if there is reason to doubt the ability to collect such interest. The Company determines the net realizable value using the same methodologies used to determine the fair value of investments. Structuring, upfront and similar fees are recorded as a discount on investments purchased and are accreted into interest income, on a straight line basis, which we have determined not to be materially different from the effective yield method. 
 
 The Company records prepayment penalties for loans and debt securities paid back to us prior to the maturity date as interest income upon receipt. 
 
 The Company generally place loans on non-accrual status when there is a reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. If, however, management believes the principal and interest will be collected, a loan may be left on accrual status during the period the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment of the financial condition of the borrower. Non-accrual loans are generally restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our management s judgment, is likely to remain current over the remainder of the term. 
 
 Valuation of Investments 
 
 The Company accounts for all of its investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Fair value is the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company has categorized its investments into a three-level fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 2. 
 
 Most of the Company s investments are loans to private companies, which are not actively traded in any market and for which quotations are not available. For those investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or when such market quotations are deemed by the Advisor not to represent fair value, the Company s board of managers has approved a multi-step valuation process to be followed each fiscal quarter, as described below: 

1. 
 Each investment is valued by the Advisor on a quarterly basis; 

51

Table of Contents 

2. 
 Materiality is assessed quarterly on all investments to determine whether an independent review is appropriate. The Advisor engages a third-party valuation firm to conduct an independent review of the reasonableness of the Advisor s internal estimates of fair value on qualifying loans, and to provide an opinion of whether they concur with the Advisor s analysis. The independent assessment occurs on a discretionary basis based on qualifications that takes into account both quantitative thresholds and qualitative considerations, as determined by the Advisor. The analysis performed by the independent valuation firm was based upon data and assumptions provided to it by the Company and received from third party sources, which the independent valuation firm relied upon as being accurate without independent verification. The results of the analyses performed by the independent valuation firm are among the factors taken into consideration by the Company and its management in making its determination with respect to the fair value of such investments, but are not determinative. The Company and its management are solely and ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments in good faith; 

3. 
 The audit committee of the Company s board of managers reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation prepared by the Advisor and any report rendered by the independent valuation firm; and 

4. 
 The board of managers discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good faith based on the inputs which include but are not limited to, inputs of the Advisor, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee. The Company and its board of managers are solely and ultimately responsible for the determination, in good faith, of the fair value of each investment. 

Below is a description of factors that the Company s board of managers may consider when valuing its investments. 
 
 Any potential valuation adjustments are subject to a materiality threshold as determined by the Advisor. Due to the fact that all non-Watch List investments are performing loans, with no macroeconomic indicator or other event observed that would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the underlying performance or collateral value of the investment, most of these investments have a fair value that that does not deviate materially from amortized cost. If, pursuant to the Company s quarterly review, the Company determines that one or more material valuation adjustments are appropriate, then the Company adjusts the fair value. Historically, in most cases when these adjustments have resulted in a fair value that is materially different from amortized cost, it has resulted in the Company s determination to place the investment on the Watch List. 
 
 Fixed income investments are typically valued utilizing a market approach, income approach, collateral based approach, or a combination of these approaches (and any others, as appropriate). The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including the sale of a business) and is used less frequently due to the private nature of our investments. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, interest and principal payments) to a single present value amount (Discounted Cash Flow or DCF calculated based on an appropriate discount rate. The measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. For Watch List investments, we may use a collateral based approach (also known as a liquidation or net recovery approach). The collateral based approach uses estimates of the collateral value of the borrower s assets using an expected recovery model. When using the collateral based approach, the Company determines the fair value of the remaining assets, discounted to reflect the anticipated amount of time to recovery and the uncertainty of recovery. The Company also may make further adjustments to account for anticipated costs of recovery, including legal fees and expenses. In following a given approach, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in valuing our investments include, as applicable: 

Macro-economic factors that are relevant to the investment or the underlying borrower 

Industry factors that are relevant to the investment or the underlying borrower 

Historical and projected financial performance of the borrower based on most recent financial statements 

Borrower draw requests and payment track record 

Loan covenants, duration and drivers 

Performance and condition of the collateral (nature, type and value) that supports the investment 

Sub-Advisor recommendation as to possible impairment or reserve, including updates and feedback 

For participations, our ownership percentage of the overall facility 

Key inputs and assumptions that are believed to be most appropriate for the investment and the approach utilized 

Applicable global interest rates 

Impact of investments placed on non-accrual status 

With respect to warrants and other equity investments, as well as certain fixed income investments, the Company may also look to private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies, option pricing models or industry practices in determining fair value. The Company may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as any other factors we deem relevant in measuring the fair values of its investments.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control involves maintaining records that accurately represent our business transactions, providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization, and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be detected or prevented on a timely basis. 
 
 Because of its innate limitations, internal control over our financial statements is not intended to provide an absolute guarantee that a financial statement misstatement can be detected or prevented. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condition, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation and those criteria, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. 
 
 Board of Managers 
 
 We operate under the direction of our board of managers, whose members are accountable to us and to our unitholders as fiduciaries. The board is responsible for the direction and control of our affairs. The board has engaged our Advisor to manage our day-to-day affairs and our portfolio of investment assets, subject to the board s supervision. Because of the conflicts of interests created by the relationships between us and our Advisor and its affiliates, certain of the responsibilities of the board have been delegated to a committee comprised exclusively of independent managers. 
 
 We currently have five managers on our board of managers, three of whom are independent of us, our Advisor, our Sponsor and our respective affiliates. Our full board of managers has determined that each of our independent managers is independent in accordance with our operating agreement. Our operating agreement defines an independent manager as a person who has not been, directly or indirectly associated with our Sponsor or the Advisor within previous two years by virtue of: 

ownership interests in our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than any compensation received for being a manager or director as permitted below; 

employment by our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates; 

service as an officer, director or manager of our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than as a manager or director for us and up to two other funds organized by our Sponsor or advised by our Advisor with securities registered under the federal securities laws; 

performance of services, other than as our manager; or 

maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates. 

We refer to our managers who are not independent as our affiliated managers. Our operating agreement sets forth the material business or professional relationships that cause a person to be affiliated with us and therefore not eligible to serve as an independent manager. A business or professional relationship is per se material if the prospective independent manager received more than five percent of his or her annual gross income in the last two years from our Sponsor, our Advisor or any affiliate of our Sponsor or our Advisor, or if more than five percent of his or her net worth, on a fair market value basis, has come from our Sponsor, our Advisor or any affiliate of our Sponsor or our Advisor. 
 
 The board of managers may increase the number of managers and fill any vacancy on the board of managers, whether resulting from an increase in the number of managers or otherwise. Any vacancies on our board of managers may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining managers in office, even if the remaining managers do not constitute a quorum. Any replacements for vacancies among the independent managers will be nominated by the remaining independent managers. In addition, our unitholders, by a majority vote, may remove a manager and elect a new manager. 
 
 Our managers are accountable to us and to our unitholders as fiduciaries. This means that each manager must perform his or her duties in good faith and in a manner that each manager considers to be in our best interest and in the best interests of the unitholders. Our managers have a fiduciary responsibility for the safekeeping and use of all funds and assets of the Company and will not employ or permit another to employ such funds or assets in any manner except for the exclusive benefit of the Company. Further, our managers must act with such care as a prudent person in a similar situation would use under similar circumstances, including exercising reasonable inquiry when acting. However, our managers are not required to devote all of their time to our business and must devote only that portion of their time to our business as the reasonable execution of the duties shall require. We do not expect that our managers will be required to devote a significant portion of their time to us in discharging their duties. 
 
 In addition to meetings of the various committees of the board, which committees we describe below, we expect our board of managers to hold at least four regular board meetings each year. During 2022, the board of managers held 11 meetings. Our board has the authority to pay compensation to independent managers in connection with services rendered to us in any other capacity.

 Limited Liability and Indemnification of Managers, Officers, Employees and Other Agents

We will not provide that our Sponsor, a manager, our Advisor or its affiliates (the Indemnitee is held harmless for any loss or liability suffered by us unless all of the following conditions are met: 

the Indemnitee has determined in good faith that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interests; 

the Indemnitee was acting on our behalf or performing services for us; 

in the case of an independent manager, the loss or liability was not the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the independent manager; 

in the case of a manager other than an independent manager, our Advisor or one of its affiliates, the loss or liability was not the result of negligence or misconduct by the party seeking to be held harmless; and 

the agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our assets and not from our unitholders.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Each of our executive officers, including each executive officer who serves as a manager, is employed by our Sponsor and also serves as an executive officer of our Advisor. Each of these individuals receives compensation from our Sponsor for his or her services, including services performed for us and for our Advisor. As executive officers of our Advisor, these individuals will manage our day-to-day affairs and carry out the directives of our board of managers in the review and selection of our sub-advisor and review of our investment opportunities and will oversee and monitor our acquired investments. Although we will reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred in connection with providing these services to us, we do not intend to pay any compensation directly to our executive officers and we will not reimburse our Advisor for the salaries and benefits paid to our named executive officers, as defined under the federal securities rules and regulations.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 
 Because the Advisory Agreement provides that the Advisor assumes principal responsibility for managing our affairs, we have no employees, and our executive officers, in their capacities as such, do not receive compensation from us, nor do they work exclusively on our affairs. In their capacities as officers or employees of the Advisor or its affiliates, they devote such portion of their time to our affairs as is required for the performance of the duties of the Advisor under the Advisory Agreement. The compensation received by our executive officers is not paid or determined by us, but rather by an affiliate of the Advisor based on all of the services provided by these individuals. See Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence below for a summary of the fees and expenses payable to the Advisor and other affiliates. 
 
 Compensation Committee Report 
 
 We do not currently have a compensation committee, however, our compensation committee, if formed, would be comprised entirely of independent managers. In lieu of a formal compensation committee, our independent managers perform an equivalent function. Our independent managers have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K CD A with management. Based on the independent managers review of the CD A and their discussions of the CD A with management, the independent managers recommended to the board of managers, and the board of managers has approved, that the CD A be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

INDEPENDENT MANAGERS: 

Terry Otton 

Cynthia Hostetler 

R. Michael Barth 

The foregoing report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Annual Report on Form 10-K into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or under the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 
 We do not currently have a compensation committee, however, we intend that our compensation committee, if formed, would be comprised entirely of independent managers. In lieu of a formal compensation committee, our independent managers perform an equivalent function . None of our independent managers served as one of our officers or employees or as an officer or employee of any of our subsidiaries during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , or formerly served as one of our officers or as an officer of any of our subsidiaries. In addition, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , none of our executive officers served as a manager or member of a compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of managers) of any entity that has one or more executive officers or managers serving as a member of our board of managers. 
 
 We do not expect that any of our executive officers will serve as a director or member of the compensation committee of any entity whose executive officers include a member of our compensation committee, if formed. We have not retained any independent compensation consultants.

Certain Conflict Resolution Measures 
 
 Corporate Governance and Conflicts Committee 
 
 In order to ameliorate the risks created by conflicts of interest, our operating agreement creates a corporate governance and conflicts committee of our board of managers composed solely of independent managers. Our operating agreement authorizes the corporate governance and conflicts committee to act on any matter related to conflicts of interest and to retain its own legal and financial advisors when and if it deems such an action appropriate. Among the issues relating to conflict of interest we expect the corporate governance and conflicts committee to act upon are: 

The continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with the Advisor and its affiliates, including the Advisory Agreement; 

Transactions with affiliates; 

Compensation of the Advisor; and 

Whether and when we seek to pursue a liquidity event. 

Other Provisions Relating to Conflicts of Interest 
 
 In addition to the creation of the corporate governance and conflicts committee, our operating agreement contains many other restrictions regarding conflicts of interest, including the following: 
 
 Advisor Compensation: Our independent manager s review, at least annually, whether the compensation we contract to pay TriLinc Advisors and its affiliates is reasonable relative to the nature and quality of the services provided and the investment performance of the Company and that the provisions of the Advisory Agreement are being carried out. The board of managers may consider all factors that they deem relevant in making these determinations. 
 
 Investments with affiliates: We may not invest in any asset or company in which the Advisor, any of our managers or officers or any of their affiliates has a direct economic interest without a determination by the majority of our board of managers (including a majority of our independent managers) that such an investment is fair and reasonable to us. In addition, with respect to any potential debt investment in a portfolio company in which our sub-advisor has an equity interest, our Advisor must determine, before the investment is made, that the procedures by which this potential debt investment is evaluated and priced are fair and reasonable. 
 
 Purchase of assets from affiliates: We may not purchase assets from the Sponsor, Advisor, manager or any of their affiliates unless a majority of our board of managers (including a majority of our independent managers) not otherwise interested in the transaction determine that such transaction is fair and reasonable to us and at a price to us no greater than the cost of the assets to the Advisor or its affiliates or such manager, unless there is substantial justification for any amount that exceeds such cost and such excess amount is determined to be reasonable. In no event would the cost of any such assets to us exceed its then current appraised value. 
 
 Sale of assets to affiliates: We may not sell or lease assets to the Sponsor, Advisor, manager or any of their affiliates or to the managers without a determination by a majority of our board of managers (including a majority of our independent managers) not otherwise interested in the transaction, that such transaction is fair and reasonable to us. 
 
 Loans to/from affiliates: We may not borrow money from the Sponsor, Advisor, managers or any of their affiliates unless a majority of our board of managers (including a majority of our independent managers) not otherwise interested in transaction approve it as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable to us and no less favorable to us than loans between unaffiliated parties under similar circumstances. 
 
 Other restrictions on transactions with affiliates: We may not give our Advisor an exclusive right to sell our assets. Our Advisor is prohibited from commingling our funds with the funds of any other entity or person for which it provides advisory or other services. Our Advisor is prohibited from providing any financing with a term in excess of 12 months to us. We may not pay a commission or fee, either directly or indirectly to our Advisor, or its affiliates, except as otherwise permitted by our operating agreement. In addition, our operating agreement prohibits our Advisor and its affiliates from receiving or accepting any rebate, give-up or similar arrangement that is prohibited under federal or state securities laws. Our Advisor and its affiliates are also prohibited from participating in any reciprocal business arrangement that would circumvent provisions of federal or state securities laws governing conflicts of interest or investment restrictions. 
 
 We may not invest in general partnerships or joint ventures with affiliates and non-affiliates unless certain conditions, described in our operating agreement are met. 
 
 A majority of our board of managers (including a majority of our independent managers) not otherwise interested in the transaction must conclude that all other transactions between us and the Sponsor, Advisor, any of the managers or any of their affiliates are fair and reasonable to us and on terms and conditions not less favorable to us than those available from unaffiliated third parties. The terms pursuant to which any goods or services, other than those services provided pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, are provided to us by the Advisor, will be embodied in a written contract, the material terms of which will be fully disclosed to our unitholders in a prospectus supplement or another filing.

Allocation of Investment Opportunities 
 
 We rely on our executive officers and our Advisor s investment professionals to identify suitable investments. Our Sponsor and other affiliated entities also rely on these same key investment professionals. Many investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for the Sponsor or affiliates of the Sponsor, including TriLinc Global Sustainable Income Fund, LLC TGSIF ), a private impact investment fund sponsored by the Sponsor. The Sponsor, the Advisor and their affiliates share certain of the same executive officers and key employees, which we refer to as TriLinc Professionals. When the TriLinc Professionals direct an investment opportunity to the Sponsor or any affiliate of the Sponsor, including TGSIF, they, in their sole discretion, have to determine the program for which the investment opportunity is most suitable based on the investment objectives, portfolio and criteria of each program. The Advisory Agreement requires that this determination be made in a manner that is fair without favoring the Sponsor or any affiliate of the Sponsor. The factors that the TriLinc Professionals consider when determining the entity for which an investment opportunity would be the most suitable are the following: 

the investment objectives and criteria of the Sponsor and the other affiliated entities; 

the cash requirements of the Sponsor and its affiliates; 

the portfolio of the Sponsor and its affiliates by type of investment and risk of investment; 

the policies of the Sponsor and its affiliates relating to leverage; 

the anticipated cash flow of the asset to be acquired; 

the income tax effects of the purchase; 

the size of the investment; and 

the amount of funds available to the Sponsor and its affiliates and the length of time such funds have been available for investment. 

In the event that our investment objectives overlap with those of another affiliate s program and the opportunity is equally suitable for us and the affiliated program, then the opportunity shall be allocated to such program that had the funds available for investment for a longer time period. 
 
 If a subsequent event or development causes any investment, in the opinion of the TriLinc Professionals, to be more appropriate for another affiliated entity, they may offer the investment to such entity. 
 
 Our independent managers are responsible for reviewing our Advisor s performance and determining that the compensation to be paid to our Advisor is reasonable and, in doing so, our independent managers must consider, among other factors, the success of our Advisor in generating appropriate investment opportunities for us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Unitholders and the Board of Managers of 
 TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of TriLinc Global Impact Fund, LLC and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, including the consolidated schedule of investments, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Fair value of investments and net realizable value of interest receivable 
 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company measures its investments at fair value and interest receivable at net realizable value. The Company s investment portfolio is comprised of senior secured term loans, senior secured term loan participations, senior secured trade finance participations, and other investments, where the borrowers are small and medium enterprises, primarily in developing economies. The Company determines the fair value of investments primarily using the income and collateral-based approaches which each use significant unobservable inputs. The Company determines the net realizable value of interest receivable using the same methodologies used to determine the fair value of investments. As of December 31, 2022, investments at fair value and interest receivable were 274 million and 26 million, respectively. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the fair value of investments and net realizable value of interest receivable as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjective auditor judgement required to evaluate certain key inputs used in the income and collateral-based models utilized in the valuation of these accounts. These key inputs included discount rates, estimated timing and amount of future cash flows and, for certain investments, the expected proceeds from liquidation of collateral and other proceedings. Changes in these inputs could have a significant impact on the fair value of investments and net realizable value of interest receivable. Additionally, specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the discount rates. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls related to the selection of key inputs used in the determination of the fair value of investments and the net realizable value of interest receivable. For certain investments and interest receivable balances, we (1) compared cash flow projections used by the Company to the terms of the loan agreement or the expected terms of the loan restructuring, (2) evaluated the borrowers financial condition through the inspection of the borrowers financial reports or other documentation, as applicable. For certain investments and interest receivable balances, we compared the expected proceeds from the liquidation of collateral and other proceedings to underlying third-party documentation related to the collateral amounts used in developing the liquidation value. For certain investments and interest receivable balances, we further assessed the Company s estimates of future cash flows from bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings by comparing such amounts to appraisals or other court issued documentation. 
 
 For certain investments and interest receivable balances, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 
 o evaluating the Company s discount rates by comparing each to a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available data of similar credit risk instruments. 

o evaluating the Company s estimate of value and implied yield by developing an independent estimate of value based upon independently developed ranges of inputs utilizing relevant market information from publicly available data of similar credit risk instruments.

employees, primarily in developing economies that provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. The Company uses the proceeds raised from the issuance of units to invest in SMEs through local market sub-advisors in a diversified portfolio of financial assets, including direct loans, convertible debt instruments, trade finance, structured credit and preferred and common equity investments. To a lesser extent, the Company may also make impact investments in companies that may not meet our technical definition of SMEs due to a larger number of employees but that also provide the opportunity to achieve both competitive financial returns and positive measurable impact. In addition, the Company may also make investments in developed economies, including the United States. The Company generally expects that such investments will have similar investment characteristics as SMEs as defined by the Company. The Company s investment objectives are to generate current income, capital preservation and modest capital appreciation primarily through investments in SMEs. The Company is externally managed by TriLinc Advisors, LLC (the Advisor ). The Advisor is an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

 Liquidity 
 
 T he COVID- 19 pandemic and its lingering effects have adversely impacted many of the Company s borrowers both directly and indirectly. First, the adverse impact on the global supply chain, which was exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has been one of the largest challenges for our borrowers, as most of them are exporters whose income is directly tied to global trade. However, supply chain disruptions and goods shortages have improved throughout 2022, though the rate of commodity price normalization slowed in the fourth quarter. Second, our borrowers experienced challenges related to the decrease in global demand during 2020, 2021 and 2022 which decreased revenue for many of them. Additionally, input costs remain high and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has increased the disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries. The Company expects some of the regions in which it invests to achieve economic normalization once the lingering supply chain disruptions, input cost increases and elevated interest rates dissipate. However, the Company believes certain regions, industries and borrowers may experience further material economic distress due to the compound impact of more than three years of economic hardship and some borrowers may find it difficult or impossible to recover. If the continuing impacts of COVID- 19, combined with rising input costs, further adversely affect borrowers businesses, financial condition and results of operations, borrowers may be unable to make required payments in the near term, which could impact the fair value of the Company s investments. 
 
 Economic conditions globally remain challenging, particularly for advanced economies due to the dramatic rise in interest rates. While inflation and rising interest rates are major issues in most advanced economies, the Company believes they are not core issues in the Company s markets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, economic projections were relatively stable, with the notable exception of China, which struggled significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of its transition from its Zero Covid policy to a near-complete reopening. The Company continues to believe that the central issue driving results is that borrowers are struggling to recover from the compound impact of more than three years of economic hardship. Indeed, although the Company s NAV per unit modestly decreased by as of December 31, 2022, compared to the NAV per unit as of December 31, 2021, the Company s NAV is a reflection of the cumulative effect of 12 consecutive quarters of the adverse economic impact of COVID- 19 and its ramifications, including persistent supply chain and cash flow issues, on our borrowers. 
 
 As a result of the current macro-economic environment, the Company experienced decreased liquidity through year end 2022; however, it expects this will be short-lived, as the decline in liquidity is primarily the result of the inconsistent cash flows generated from the existing portfolio caused by these economic uncertainties. The decrease in liquidity has the potential to impact the Company s ability to cover its future distributions to its unitholders or meet other Company obligations. In order to address the Company s temporary liquidity needs, on September 1, 2022, the Company sold million of its investment in Africell Holding Limited to an entity whose advisor is under common ownership with the Company s Advisor and, subsequent to September 30, 2022, the Company sold one of its participation interests to a third party for million, with an agreement to repurchase the participation from the buyer in approximately four months (as further discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements). In the short-term, the Company may pursue additional repurchase or other financial transactions, as needed, to supplement cash flows to allow the Company to maintain normal future operations. 

of each Subsidiary and, as such, the Subsidiaries are consolidated into the Company s consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent they occur, are eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the operations and financial condition as of and for the periods presented. These financial statements are presented in United States U.S. dollars, which is the functional and reporting currency of the Company and all its Subsidiaries. 

Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and where there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. The inputs for the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation and is based upon management s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

These investments include debt and equity investments in private companies or assets valued using the income or liquidation approach and may involve pricing models whose inputs require significant judgment or estimation because of the absence of any meaningful current market data for identical or similar investments. The inputs in these valuations may include, but are not limited to, capitalization and discount rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples. The information may also include pricing information or broker quotes, which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. Certain investments may be valued based upon a collateral approach, which uses estimated value of underlying collateral and includes adjustments deemed necessary for estimates of costs to obtain control and liquidate available collateral. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as Level 3 information, assuming no additional corroborating evidence. 
 
 The inputs used in the determination of fair value may require significant judgment or estimation. 
 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at those quotations. Most of the Company s investments are loans to private companies, which are not actively traded in any market and for which quotations are not available. For those investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or when such market quotations are deemed by the Advisor not to represent fair value, the Company s board of managers has approved a multi-step valuation process to be followed each fiscal quarter, as described below: 
 
 1. Each investment is valued by the Advisor on a quarterly basis; 

2. Materiality is assessed quarterly on all investments to determine whether an independent review is appropriate. The Advisor engages a third -party valuation firm to conduct an independent review of the reasonableness of the Advisor s internal estimates of fair value on qualifying loans, and to provide an opinion of whether they concur with the Advisor s analysis. The independent assessment occurs on a discretionary basis based on qualifications that takes into account both quantitative thresholds and qualitative considerations, as determined by the Advisor. The analysis performed by the independent valuation firm is based upon data and assumptions provided to it by the Company and received from third party sources, which the independent valuation firm relies upon as being accurate without independent verification. The results of the analyses performed by the independent valuation firm are among the factors taken into consideration by the Company and its management in making its determination with respect to the fair value of such investments, but are not determinative. The Company and its management are solely and ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of the Company s investments in good faith; 

3. The audit committee of the Company s board of managers reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation prepared by the Advisor and any report rendered by the independent valuation firm; and 

4. The board of managers discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the Company s portfolio in good faith based on the inputs which include but are not limited to, inputs of the Advisor, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee. The Company and its board of managers are solely and ultimately responsible for the determination, in good faith, of the fair value of each investment. 

Below is a description of factors that the Company s board of managers may consider when valuing the Company s investments. 
 
 Any potential valuation adjustments are subject to a materiality threshold as determined by the Advisor. Due to the fact that all non-Watch List investments are performing loans, no macroeconomic indicator or other event observed that would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the underlying performance or collateral value of the investment. If, pursuant to the Company's quarterly review, the Company determines that one or more material valuation adjustments are appropriate, then the Company adjusts the fair value. Historically, in most cases when these adjustments have resulted in a fair value that is materially different from the investment s amortized cost, the Company has determined to place it on the Watch List. 

Fixed income investments are typically valued utilizing an income approach, collateral based approach, or a combination of these approaches (and any others, as appropriate). The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including the sale of a business) and is used less frequently due to the private nature of the Company s investments. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, interest and principal payments) to a single present value amount (Discounted Cash Flow or DCF calculated based on an appropriate discount rate. The measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. For Watch List investments, the Company predominantly uses the income approach, but may also use a collateral based approach (also known as a liquidation or net recovery approach), or a hybrid approach consisting of the income approach and the collateral based approach. The collateral based approach uses estimates of the collateral value of the borrower s assets using an expected recovery model. When using the collateral based approach, the Company determines the fair value of the remaining assets, discounted to reflect the anticipated amount of time to recovery and the uncertainty of recovery. The Company also may make further adjustments to account for anticipated costs of recovery, including legal fees and expenses. In following a given approach, the types of factors that the Company may take into account in valuing the Company s investments include, as applicable: 
 
 Macro-economic factors that are relevant to the investment or the underlying borrower 

Industry factors that are relevant to the investment or the underlying borrower 

Historical and projected financial performance of the borrower based on most recent financial statements 

Borrower draw requests and payment track record 

Loan covenants, duration and drivers 

Performance and condition of the collateral (nature, type and value) that supports the investment 

Sub-Advisor recommendation as to possible impairment or reserve, including updates and feedback 

For participations, the Company s ownership percentage of the overall facility 

Key inputs and assumptions that are believed to be most appropriate for the investment and the approach utilized 

Applicable global interest rates 

Impact of investments placed on non-accrual status 

With respect to warrants and other equity investments, as well as certain fixed income investments, the Company may also look to private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third -party investments in the portfolio companies, option pricing models or industry practices in determining fair value. The Company may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as any other factors the Company deems relevant in measuring the fair values of the Company s investments.

The distribution fee is payable until the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of the Class C units on a national securities exchange, (ii) following completion of each respective offering, total selling compensation equaling of the gross proceeds of such offering, or (iii) there are no longer any Class C units outstanding. In addition, the Company pays an ongoing dealer manager fee for each Class I unit and Class W unit sold pursuant to a private placement. Such ongoing dealer manager fee is payable for five years until the earlier of: x the date on which such Class I units or Class W units are repurchased by the Company; (y) the listing of the Class I units or Class W units on a national securities exchange, the sale of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; or (z) the fifth anniversary of the admission of the investor as a unitholder. Further, the Company pays an ongoing service fee for each Class W unit sold pursuant to the private placement. Such ongoing service fee is payable for six years until the earlier of: x the date on which such Class W units are repurchased by the Company; (y) the listing of the Class W units on a national securities exchange, the sale of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; or (z) the sixth anniversary of the admission of the investor as a unitholder. The distribution fees, ongoing dealer manager fees and service fees are not paid at the time of purchase. Such fees are payable monthly in arrears, as they become contractually due. 
 
 The Company accounts for the distribution fees as a charge to equity at the time each Class C unit was sold in the Offering and recorded a corresponding liability for the estimated amount to be paid in future periods. The Company accounts for the ongoing dealer manager fees and service fees paid in connection with the sale of Class I and Class W units in the private placement in the same manner. At December 31, 2022 , the estimated unpaid distribution fees for Class C units amounted to , the unpaid dealer manager fees for Class I units amounted to and the unpaid dealer manager and service fees for Class W units amounted to . 
 
 tax liability for uncertain tax positions had been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements nor did the Company recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The earliest year that the Company s income tax returns are subject to examination is the period ended Decem ber 31, 2019. 
 
 Unitholders are individually responsible for reporting income or loss, to the extent required by the federal and state income tax laws and regulations, based upon their respective share of the Company s income and expense as reported for income tax purposes. 
 
 for the estimated future amount of Class C unit distribution fees, Class I unit dealer manager fees, Class W unit ongoing dealer manager fees and Class W unit service fees payable. Such fees are charged against capital when incurred. 
 
 The Company is not required to determine its net asset value per unit under GAAP and therefore, its determination of net asset value per unit for Class C units, Class I units and Class W units varies from GAAP. The Company does not deduct the liability for estimated future distribution fees in its calculation of net asset value per unit for Class C units. Further, the Company does not deduct the liability for estimated future dealer manager fees in its calculation of the net asset value per unit for Class I units and Class W units. Likewise, the Company does not deduct the liability for estimated future service fees in its calculation of the net asset value per unit for Class W units. The Company believes this approach is consistent with the industry standard and appropriate since the Company intends for the net asset value to reflect the estimated value on the date that the Company determines its net asset value. 

Accordingly, the Company believes that its estimated net asset value at any given time should not include considerati on of any estimated future distribution, ongoing dealer manager or service fees that may become payable after such date. As a result, as of December 31, 2022 , each of the Class A, Class C, Class I, Class W, Class Y and Class Z units have the same net asset value per unit of approximately , which is different than the net asset value per unit of approximately (on an aggregate basis for all unit classes) as shown in Note 10 Financial Highlights. This net asset value per unit reflects a decrease of approximately per unit from the net asset value per unit of approximately as of December 31, 2021 . The decrease in net asset value per unit was due to a combination of factors, including the adverse impact of COVID- 19 and the Company having recorded in net change in unrealized depreciation on its investments d uring the year ended December 31, 2022 .

of the gross offering proceeds raised from the Offering (the O O Reimbursement Limit and were accrued and payable by the Company only to the extent that such costs did not exceed the O O Reimbursement Limit. Reimbursements to the Sponsor of organi zation and offering costs are included as a reduction to net assets on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets. Based on the proceeds raised through the end of the Offering, the organization and offering costs did not exceed the O O Reimbursement Limit, and reimbursement to the Sponsor of the initial offering and organization costs were recorded in periods prior to 2021. The Company continues to incur certain offering costs associated with the DRP as well as the ongoing fees described above in Distribution and Ongoing Dealer Manager and Service Fees. The Company may incur these costs directly, or may reimburse the Sponsor for paying these offering costs on behalf of the Company. 
 
 of the inv estments that the Company has deemed Watch List investments, which are investments with respect to which the Company has determined there have been significant changes in the credit and collection risk of the investment. As described in Note 3, IIG failed to provide the Company with complete and accurate information with respect to the Company s investments for which IIG was the sub-advisor, and sold the Company a million participation in a loan that did not exist. In November 2019, the SEC charged IIG with fraud and revoked IIG's registration as an investment adviser. On March 30, 2020, the SEC obtained a final judgment on consent that enjoins IIG from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. IIG has ceased operations and the Company does not expect to receive any further reporting from IIG with respect to its outstanding investments. IIG s acts and omissions have negatively affected and are likely to continue to negatively affect the value of certain of the Company s investments, which could adversely affect returns to the Company s unitholders. 
 
 The Company s investments consist of loans, loan participations and trade finance participations that are illiquid and non-traded, making purchase or sale of such financial instruments at desired prices or in desired quantities difficult. Furthermore, the sale of any such investments may be possible only at substantial discounts, and it may be extremely difficult to value any such investments accurately. 
 
 The value of the Company s investments in loans may be detrimentally affected to the extent, among other things, that a borrower defaults on its obligations, there is insufficient collateral securing the loan and/or there are extensive legal and other costs incurred in collecting on a defaulted loan, observable secondary or primary market yields for similar instruments issued by comparable companies increase materially or risk premiums required in the market between smaller companies, such as the Company s borrowers, and those for which market yields are observable increase materially. The majority of the Company s investments are in the form of participation interests, in financing facilities originated by one of the Company s sub-advisors. Accordingly, the Company s counterparty for investments in participation interests generally will be the respective sub-advisor or its affiliate. The Company will not have a contract with the underlying borrower and therefore, in the event of default, will not have the ability to directly seek recovery against the collateral and instead will have to seek recovery through the Company s sub-advisor counterparty, which increases the risk of full recovery. These risks may be further exacerbated by the adverse impact the COVID- 19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the business of our borrowers. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , all but one of the Company s investments were denominated in U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar rises, it may become more difficult for borrowers to make loan payments if the borrowers are operating in markets where the local currencies are depreciating relative the U.S. dollar. 

In addition, certain of the Company s investments in loans contain a PIK interest provision. These investments may expose us to higher risks, including an increased risk of potential loss because PIK interest results in an increase in the size of the outstanding loan balance. The Company may also be exposed to the risk that it may be more difficult to value the investments because the continuing accrual of interest requires continuing subjective judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of the underlying collateral. To the extent the loan is structured as a PIK interest-only loan, the probability and magnitude of a loss on the Company s investment may increase. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 , the Company s largest loan by valu e was , or of total investments, and provides for PIK interest, with principal and interest due at maturity. The Company s largest loans by value comprised of the Company s portfolio at December 31, 2022 . Participations in loans amounted to of the Company s total por tfolio at December 31, 2022 .

Participations 
 
 The majority of the Company s investments are in the form of participation interests Participations ). Participations are interests in financing facilities originated by one of the Company s sub-advisors. Participations may be interests in one specific loan or trade finance transaction, several loans or trade finance transactions under a facility, or may be interests in an entire facility. The Company s rights under Participations include, without limitation, all corresponding rights in payments, collateral, guaranties, and any other security interests obtained by the respective sub-advisor in the underlying financing facilities. 
 
 Interest Receivable 
 
 Depending on the specific terms of the Company s investments, interest earned by the Company is payable either monthly, quarterly, or, in the case of most trade finance investments, at maturity. As such, some of the Company s trade finance investments have up to a year of accrued interest receivable as of December 31, 2022 . In addition, certain of the Company s investments in term loans accrue deferred interest, which is not payable until the maturity of the loans. Accrued deferred interest included in the interest receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to approximatel y an d , respectively. The Company s interest receivable balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are recorded at net realizable value. 

Trade Finance 
 
 Trade finance encompasses a variety of lending structures that support the export, import or sale of goods between producers and buyers in various countries and across various jurisdictions. The strategy is most prevalent in the financing of commodities. The Company s Participations in trade finance positions typically fall into two broad categories: pre-export financing and receivable/inventory financing. Pre-export financing represents advances to borrowers based on proven orders from buyers. Receivable/inventory financing represents advances on borrowers eligible receivable and inventory balances. For trade finance, the structure and terms of the facility underlying the Company s Participations vary according to the nature of the transaction being financed. The structure can take the form of a revolver with multiple draw requests and maturity of up to one year based on collateral and performance requirements. The structure can also be specific to the individual transaction being financed, which typically have shorter durations of days. With respect to underwriting, particular consideration is given to the following: 
 
 nature of the goods or transaction being financed, 

the terms associated with the sale and repayment of the goods, 

the execution risk associated with producing, storing and shipment of the goods, 

the financial and performance profile of both the borrower and end buyer(s), 

the underlying advance rate and subsequent Loan to Value LTV associated with lending against the goods that serve to secure the facility or transaction, 

collateral and financial controls (collection accounts and inventory possession), 

third party inspections and insurance, and 

the region, country or jurisdiction in which the financing is being completed. 

Collateral varies by transaction, but is typically raw or finished goods inventory, and/or receivables. In the case of pre-export finance, the transaction is secured by purchase orders from buyers or offtake contracts, which are agreements between a buyer and seller to purchase/sell a future product. 
 
 Terms depend on the nature of the facility or transaction being financed. As such, they depend on the credit profile of the underlying financing, as well as the speed and detail associated with the request for financing. Interest can be paid as often as monthly or quarterly on revolving facilities one year in duration) or at maturity when dealing with specific transactions with shorter duration, which is the case for the majority of the Company s trade finance positions. At times, settlement can be delayed due to documentation, shipment, transportation or port clearing issues, delays associated with the end buyer or off-taker assuming possession, possible changes to contract or offtake terms, and the aggregation of settlement of multiple individual transactions. Conversely, at times payments are made ahead of schedule, as transactions either clear faster than expected, borrowers decide to prepay or pay down ahead of schedule, counterparties clear multiple individual transactions in one settlement, or less expensive financing is secured by the borrower. 
 
 On occasion, the Company may receive notice from the respective sub-advisor that a borrower or counterparty to a financing facility underlying one of the Company s Participations intends to pay ahead of schedule or in one lump sum (settling multiple draw requests all at once). Depending on timing and the ability to redeploy these funds, combined with projected inflows of capital, these outsize payments can negatively impact the Company s performance. In these situations, the credit profile of the borrower, and the transaction in general, is reviewed with the sub-advisor and a request may be made to either stagger payments, where at all possible, or request that payment only be made at the end of that specific financial quarter. These requests or accommodations, which happen very rarely, will only be made where the Company has strong comfort in and around the credit profile of the transaction or borrower. 
 
 Short Term Investments 
 
 Short term investments are defined by the Company as investments that generally meet the standard underwriting guidelines for trade finance and term loan transactions and that also have the following characteristics: 1 maturity of less than one year, 2 loans to borrowers to whom, at the time of funding, the Company does not expect to re-lend. Impact data is not tracked for short term investments. 
 
 Warrants 
 
 Certain investments, including loans and participations, may carry equity warrants, which allow the Company to buy shares of the portfolio company at a given price, which the Company may exercise at its discretion during the life of the portfolio company. The Company s goal is to ultimately dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon the disposition of such interests. However, these warrants and equity interests are generally illiquid and it may be difficult for the Company to dispose of them. In addition, the Company expects that any warrants or other return enhancements received when the Company makes or invests in loans may require several years to appreciate in value and may not appreciate at all.

The significant unobservable Level 3 inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investments are market yields used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investments, which include both future principal and interest payments. Significant increases in market yields would result in significantly lower fair value measurements. In addition, a significant decrease in future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investments due to a projected decrease in results of operations and cash flows from the underlying investments, would result in significantly lower fair value measurements.

per annum) of Gross Asset Value, as defined in the Advisory Agreement between the Company and the Advisor. Asset management fees are paid to the Advisor in exchange for fund management and administrative services. Although the Advisor manages, on the Company s behalf, many of the risks associated with global investments in developing economies, management fees do not include the cost of any hedging instruments or insurance policies that may be required to appropriately manage the Company s risk. 
 
 If certain financial goals are reached by the Company, the Company is required to pay the Advisor an incentive fee that is comprised of two parts: (i) a subordinated fee on net investment income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. The subordinated incentive fee on income is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and is based upon the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter. No subordinated incentive fee is earned by the Advisor in any calendar quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the quarterly preferred return rate of annualized) (the Preferred Return ). In any quarter, all of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the quarterly Preferred Return, but is less than or equal to annualized) at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, is payable to the Advisor. For any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds on its net assets at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the subordinated incentive fee on income equals of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 
 An incentive fee on capital gains will be earned on investments sold and shall be determined and payable to the Advisor in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. The incentive fee on capital gains is equal to of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. The Company had capital gains and therefore did not accrue an incentive fee on capital gains for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 . 
 
 Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement 
 
 On May 12, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Operating Expense Responsibility Agreement with the Advisor and the Sponsor (the Responsibility Agreement ). From the inception of the Company through December 31, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Responsibility Agreement, the Sponsor paid approximately of operating expenses, asset management fees, and incentive fees on behalf of the Company and planned to reimburse to the Company an additional of operating expenses, which had been paid by the Company as of December 31, 2017. 
 
 Pursuant to the Responsibility Agreement, the Sponsor would only be entitled to reimbursement of the cumulative expenses it had incurred on the Company s behalf to the extent the Company s investment income in any quarter surpassed certain performance thresholds set forth in the Responsibility Agreement. The Company did not achieve those thresholds during the periods covered by this report. 
 
 As a result of the detrimental impact the pandemic has had on the Company, particularly in the last three years, the Sponsor and the Advisor agreed to waive any potential future reimbursement under the Responsibility Agreement in a two -step transaction effective in the fourth quarter of 2022. In step one, the Advisor allowed the Company to offset a portion of its contingent liability to the Sponsor and the Advisor in an amount equal to the performance fees paid to the Sponsor for the three years ended December 31, 2022, bringing the amount of the Company s contingent liability to the Advisor and the Sponsor to approximately million. The Sponsor, TriLinc and the Company also agreed that in step two, the Advisor and the Sponsor would waive the remaining million contingent liability owed to them by the Company under the Responsibility Agreement in exchange for the Company extinguishing the million due from the Sponsor (which was the amount that the Sponsor had planned to reimburse the Company under the Responsibility Agreement). As a result, 4.2 million due from the Sponsor was written off and recorded as a general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2022. The amount of the waiver by the Advisor and the Sponsor is more than twice the amount of the million extinguished by the Company. 

Repurchase agreement 

On November 3, 2022, the Company entered into a transaction with an unrelated financial institution, whereby, it sold a million participation interest in one of its term loan positions and agreed to repurchase the participation days after the transaction date at a price equal to the sum of the original sales price plus accrued interest calculated at a simple annualized rate. The excess between the interest earned on the term loan position and the simple annualized rate was paid by the Company to another unrelated party as a transaction fee. gain or loss was recognized with respect to this transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company accrued interest expenses of under other payables.

Beginning June 11, 2014, the Company commenced a unit repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may conduct quarterly unit repurchases of up to of the weighted average number of outstanding units in any 12 -month period to allow the Company s unitholders, who have held units for a minimum of one year, to sell their units back to the Company at a price equal to the most recently determined net asset valu e per unit for each class of units, as most recently disclosed by the Company in a public filing with the SEC at the time of repurchase. Repurchases for the fourth quarter of 2022 have been made at a price equal to per unit, which was the net asset value per unit of each class as of September 30, 2022, the most recently disclosed net asset value at the time of repurchase. 

The unit repurchase program includes numerous restrictions, including a one -year holding period, that limit the ability of the Company s unitholders to sell their units. Unless the Company s board of managers determines otherwise, the Company will limit the number of units to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of units that can be repurchased with the proceeds the Company receives from the sale of units under the Company s DRP. At the sole discretion of the Company s board of managers, the Company may also use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings and cash from the repayment or liquidation of investments as of the end of the applicable quarter to repurchase units. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Co mpany fulfilled repurchase requests for a total of units at a weighted average repurchase price per unit of for an aggregate repurchase price of . As of December 31, 2022 , of these repurchase requests were pending processing and were completed by the Company in January 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , eligible repurchase requests exceeded the limitations of the Company s unit repurchase program described above and the requests were fulfilled on a pro rata bas is, such that the Company repurchased approximately units or of eligible repurchase requests (based on the number of units submitted for repurchase) and approximately units, or of eligible repurchase requests (based on the number of units submitted for repurchase), were not red eemed. Pursuant to the terms of the Company s unit repurchase program, the unsatisfied portion of repurchase requests that were not fulfilled at quarter-end will be carried over to the next quarter and treated as a request for repurchase at the next quarter-end repurchase date, unless the repurchase request is withdrawn.

On November 11, 2022, the Company s board of managers authorized the declaration of distributions for December of 2022 and January, February and March of 2023. These distributions were or will be calculated based on unitholders of record for each day in an amount equal to per unit per day (less the distribution fee with respect to Class C units, the ongoing dealer manager fee with respect to certain Class I units and Class W units and the ongoing service fee with respect to Class W units). On an annualized basis, these distributions are equal to approximately of the NAV per unit of , determined as of September 30, 2022. These distributions have been or will be paid in cash or reinvested in units, for those unitholders participating in the DRP, on or about the first day of the month following the month to which the distributions relate. There can be no assurances that distributions will continue to be paid at this rate in subsequent periods or at all.

2 For financial statement reporting purposes under GAAP, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded a liability in the amount of and 446,000, r espectively, for the estimated future amount of Class C distribution fees, Class I dealer manager fees, Class W dealer manager fees and Class W services fees payable. This liability is reflected in this table, which is consistent with the financial statements. While the Company follows GAAP for financial reporting purposes, it has determined that deducting the accrual for the estimated future amount of Class C distribution fees, Class I dealer manager fees, Class W dealer manager fees and Class W services fees may not be the appropriate approach for determining the net asset value used on the quarterly investor statements and for other purposes. The Company believes that not making such deduction for purposes of net asset value determination is consistent with the industry standard and is more appropriate since the Company intends for the net asset value to reflect the estimated value on the date that the Company determines its net asset value. 

by August 31, 2023. The leverage facility was fully repaid by that date. 

Distributions 
 
 The cash distributions for January, February, March and April totaled approximately , , and respectively. With respect to unitholders participating in the Distribution Reinvestment Plan, approximately , , and of the distributions for January, February, March and April, respectively, were reinvested in units. 
 
 There can be no assurances as to when additional distributions will be paid. 
 
 Given that we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the SEC, we temporarily suspended our Fourth Amended and Restated Distribution Reinvestment Plan and our Fourth Amended and Restated Unit Repurchase Plan. We anticipate that we will lift the suspension of both plans sometime after our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 -Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 have been filed with the SEC. 
 
 The Advisor and the Sponsor In recognition of the challenges resulting from the pandemic between 2020 and 2022, which has had a significant negative impact (although unrealized at this point) on TGIF s performance and its investors, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Advisor has determined to voluntarily waive all performance fees that may become due and payable to the Advisor for 2023. In March 2023, the Company, the Advisor and the Sponsor entered into an agreement resulting in the termination of the Responsibility Agreement, effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 5 for more information.
