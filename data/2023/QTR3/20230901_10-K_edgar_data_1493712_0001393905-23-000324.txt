 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
 GENERAL 
 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 19, 2010. On April 26, 2016, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, Cell MedX (Canada) Corp., (the Subsidiary under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. 
 
 We are a biotech company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic and non-therapeutic products that promote general health, pain relief, wellness and alleviate complications associated with medical conditions including, but not limited to: diabetes, Parkinson s disease, high blood pressure, neuropathy and kidney function. Our Subsidiary is engaged in development and manufacturing of therapeutic devices based on our proprietary eBalance Technology, which harnesses power of microcurrents and their effects on human body. 
 
 BUSINESS OF CELL MEDX 
 
 eBalance Technology Acquisition 
 
 We acquired our proprietary technology for the use of microcurrents for the treatment of diabetes and related ailments, which we call eBalance Technology, on November 25, 2014, when we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Jean Arnett and Bradley Hargreaves (the Purchase Agreement ). 
 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves sold to us all of their respective rights, title and interests in and to the eBalance Technology. In consideration for the sale of the eBalance Technology, we paid Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves a total of 100,000 and issued to each of Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves options for 
 1 
 
 the purchase of up to 10,000,000 shares (20,000,000 shares in total) of our common stock at an initial exercise price of 0.05 per share (the Options of which Options to acquire up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock vested on August 26, 2015, and 2,484,145 of vested options were exercised in August of 2020 for total consideration to the Company of 124,243. Remaining Options were cancelled pursuant to a letter agreement with Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves, dated for reference September 26, 2016. 
 
 eBalance Technology 
 
 eBalance Technology is based on the science of bioelectric signals, their effect on epigenetic events within human body, and ability to modify and effect the behavior of cells, tissue, and organs. The eBalance Systems utilize microcurrent electrical therapy MEY to deliver subsensory micro amperage current to the patient/user to support general wellness or provide temporary relief of pain. Based on this technology Cell MedX is developing a radically different and very promising family of devices whose core technology demarcates it from the approaches currently in use and those in the future advance pipeline as reflected in current medical literature. 
 
 eBalance Technology is intended to expand the traditional healthcare model of managing various pathological diseases and ailments, such as diabetes, Parkinson s disease, neuropathy, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, as well as others. eBalance Technology became a cornerstone to the Company s medical device systems, eBalance Pro and eBalance Home. eBalance Pro System was designed for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting; eBalance Home System, due to its simple interface and ease of use, enables patients to easily incorporate it into their lifestyles and continue to manage their symptoms in the comfort of their own home or while traveling. 
 
 A research and development plan adopted by the Company included a series of investigations that allowed the Company to move the eBalance Device from a prototype stage through a series of refinements and enhancements to achieve the safety and efficacy objectives of the eBalance Medical Device Systems and define a set of claims that were used for submission to the FDA s rigorous Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process for 510(k) clearance, as well as to receive Health Canada Class II Medical Device System Certification for the eBalance Home System and eBalance Pro System. Both systems are intended to be used for temporary relief of pain associated with sore-aching muscles in the shoulder, waist, back, neck, upper extremities (arm) and lower extremities (leg) due to strain from exercise or normal household work activities and general relation. The Health Canada Certifications received for the eBalance Home System and eBalance Pro System in July and August 2020, respectively, allowed the Company to define marketing claims for the eBalance products. The results of the clinical observational trial the Company finalized during its Fiscal 2018 year (the Clinical Study on the effects of eBalance technology confirmed that claims such as diabetes management, reductions in average blood sugar (HbA1C), improvement of other markers that denote the degree and quality of blood sugar control, pain management, blood pressure control, and alleviation of symptoms associated with Parkinson s disease, among several other positive results, warrant further investigation of the eBalance Systems. Due to the Company s financial situation, during the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company was forced to suspend further research of the eBalance Technology, including the PMA process for 510(k) clearance, and defaulted on its Health Canada Class II Medical Device System Certification licenses that were issued for both eBalance Home and eBalance Pro Systems, but were suspended on June 5, 2023. 
 
 Scientific Foundations 
 
 The application of electromagnetic forces to human tissues to effect biologic change has been explored since the 19th century. Recent advances in molecular biology and imaging technology have allowed insight into the sources and downstream consequences of ion flows in complex organisms. Ion flows and transmembrane gradients produced by ion channels and pumps are key regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. 
 
 In complement to the current focus on molecular genetics and stem cell biology, artificial modulation of bioelectrical signals in somatic tissues is a powerful modality that might result in profound advances in understanding and augmentation of regenerative capacity. Molecular bioelectricity and its role in cell-to-cell signaling and epigenetics (altering cell behavior without altering genes) provides a new pathway to discovery of technologies that can counteract the effects of many diseases. 
 
 Many cells in the human body are electrically excitable including those involved with production of chemical signals that affect blood sugar. One example of such a cell of the endocrine type is the L cell, which resides in the gut and secretes cell glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin. GLP-1 is an enteric hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and improves glycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that in Type 2 diabetes these cells become unsynchronized . Growing these cells in tissue 
 2 
 
 culture and subjecting them to specific electrical signals can act to resynchronize their chemical activity and alter their behavior as a dispersed metabolic organ. This serves as an illustration of how endogenous ion flows may serve as key epigenetic regulators of cell behavior and suggests that bioelectric mechanisms might be harnessed at a whole organism level to cause functional regenerative changes. It is possible that eBalance Technology may affect these processes, although that has yet to be established. We were planning to explore this hypothesis in greater detail during our future clinical trials, however, due to lack of funding, new clinical trials are not being planned 
 
 The eBalance Systems deliver microcurrent energy as electrical pulses that pass through the skin to the underlying peripheral nerves to aid in the blocking of pain signals traveling to the brain. These support general relaxation, pain management and may offer additional clinical benefits, as observed in the Company s Health Canada approved Clinical Study. 
 
 Market Opportunity - Diabetes and its Complications 
 
 Diabetes care is one of the main opportunities the Company sees for the use of its eBalance Technology. Diabetes care was also a main objective of the Company s first clinical observational trial. Diabetes is a severe and debilitating disease with profound consequences, both for the individual and for society. The complications of diabetes are devastating, and the economic costs of care comprise a substantial portion of health care budgets. Despite the best efforts of the scientific community to devise a cure, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. 
 
 According to information published by the International Diabetes Federation IDF in its IDF Diabetes Atlas Tenth Edition (2021) (www.diabetesatlas.org), in 2021, approximately 537 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes; by 2045 this will rise to 783 million. A further 541 million people are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. 1 
 
 Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) with impaired metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and proteins resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is one of the world s oldest diseases with the syndrome being discovered centuries ago. The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes has highlighted the need for increased research efforts into treatment options for both the disease itself and its associated complications. 
 
 Type 1 diabetes is caused by destruction of the insulin secreting (beta) cells of the pancreas. The pathogenesis involves autoimmune processes that lead to an absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that result in insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Non-genetic factors include increasing age, high caloric intake, obesity, central adiposity, sedentary lifestyle, and low birth weight. This group comprises approximately 90-95 of cases in the diabetes syndrome. 
 
 Chronic hyperglycemia leads to various metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic alterations in the body, which further develop a number of secondary complications, resulting in the major increases in morbidity and mortality seen with all types of diabetes. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as coronary artery disease, chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure. 
 
 High blood sugar over time can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish nerves, especially in the legs, causing tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Gradually, all sensation can be lost. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. In diabetics, minor wounds easily become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation. 
 
 Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. It also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetic hypertension is a major contributor to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which often requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. 
 
 Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes may leave people more susceptible to a variety of skin disorders, including bacterial and fungal infections. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer s disease.

Expansion of Disease Focus 
 
 Given the size of the market for diabetes control and management, the current eBalance Technology has significant potential of success based solely on treating complications caused by diabetes. However, in order to capture a larger market share, the Company was looking into developing more specialized software/treatment options which would have allowed the Company to continue to grow its market share and ensure constant revenue streams. The Company was planning to commence development of specialized software to target other ailments such as gout, hypertension, heart disease, neurological disorders, and depression, among others. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company s lack of funding and unfavorable financial position made it impossible to roll out such expansion, and management felt it necessary to stop all further research and development of eBalance Technology until the Company is financially stable and has secured substantial financing to support its day-to-day operations and further research opportunities. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is unable to provide any assurance that its attempts to raise additional capital will be successful. 
 
 Empirical Modeling 
 
 The first-in-human observations took place over many years and were carefully documented. The results of these observations lead to the belief that a specific device with a specific set of bioelectric signals of known waveform, frequency, amplitude, pulse, and duration, accompanied by sensing circuits that respond to fluctuations in the body s response, in a closed feedback loop, produced cumulative effects that led to remarkable global effects in functional aspects of living in a person who had lived with Type 1 diabetes since age 10. Research and development involving patients with longstanding Type 2 diabetes, yielded findings of a similar nature in a limited time frame. These observations were followed by broader observational studies by Cell MedX. 
 
 Effects observed in these observational studies include subjective reports of diminished fatigue, improved cognition, diminished neuropathic limb pain, improved sleep, reduction in swelling of extremities, improved skin appearance in color and texture, and a reduction in visual disturbance. Objective measures included healing of wounds, control of blood pressure leading to discontinuation or reduction of medication, and greatly improved control of blood sugars with remarkable diminution in HbA1C (which reflects average blood sugar over months). Remarkably, in the context of Type 1 Diabetes with other potential variables remaining the same, insulin requirements diminished to a considerable degree. 
 
 Clinical Trials 
 
 During January through March 2015, a preliminary Pilot Trial (the Pilot Trial was conducted which was designed to examine the short-term metabolic impact of a single treatment with eBalance Technology on two diabetic subjects. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples from each subject were sent for extensive metabolic pathway analysis at the University of Alberta Metabolomics Unit. 
 
 From those studies we observed alterations in several pathways, which are known to be deficient in persons with diabetes. The results of the Pilot Trial were notable in that significant shifts in metabolites related to blood sugar handling and disposal occurred in a very short time frame, with the only intervening variable being a 10-minute treatment with eBalance Technology. 
 
 The findings from the Pilot Trial were then used to inform further experimentation, including selection of metabolic end points for testing during a Phase IB clinical trial, which we started preparations for in July 2015. Due to shortage in available funding, the Phase IB clinical Trial was cancelled. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 we engaged Nutrasource Diagnostics Inc. Nutrasource with Dr. Richard Tytus of Hamilton Medical Research Group as the Lead Investigator, to commence observational clinical trial in Canada Clinical Study to assess and quantify eBalance technology s ability to alter key metabolic pathways while targeting improved blood sugar control. 
 
 Based on finalized investigational protocol, which received Health Canada s approval on January 12, 2017, the Clinical Study was structured to assess the impact of three months of the eBalance therapy, as an adjunct treatment, on HbA1c in thirty (30) Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. The secondary endpoints of the Clinical Study were defined to observe changes from baseline and medical history of each Clinical Study subject in the following: 
 
 Insulin sensitivity 
 4 
 
 Diabetic neuropathy 
 Diabetic foot pain and numbness 
 Wound healing 
 Blood pressure 
 Kidney function 
 Any other changes reported by patients 
 
 In-patient phase of the Clinical Study was completed on July 24, 2017, and a final clinical report was submitted to Health Canada for final approval on January 19, 2018. 
 
 All 30 subjects (100 taking part in the Clinical Study followed through to completion. The treatment was considered safe for the purposes of the Clinical Study. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events or negative abnormalities in routine hematology, biochemistry, vital signs or physical findings for the duration of the Clinical Study. 
 
 The Clinical Study resulted in clinically significant improvement in several biometric markers, including HbA1c and secondary efficacy endpoints as noted above. 
 
 Diabetes 
 
 The Clinical Study, tested the effectiveness of the eBalance therapy as an adjunct treatment for diabetes and related complications in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics over three months. The results of the Clinical Study showed that after three months of eBalance treatments, average fasting blood glucose levels declined by 12.3 from 10.5 to 9.2 millimoles per litre. Plasma insulin declined by 46.7 from 168 to 78 picomoles per liter. These results indicate that, on average, the blood glucose uptake was increased and that less insulin was required to achieve that uptake. HbA1c levels declined by 0.16 from 8.36 to 8.20 . A longer double-blind, placebo-controlled study may be conducted in the future to determine if HbA1c levels would be further reduced as improving HbA1c by just 1 for individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes lowers their risk of combined microvascular complications by 25 . 2 
 
 One of the largest diabetes clinical trials ever conducted, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that for every 1 reduction in HbA1c, the relative risk for: 
 
 Microvascular complications decreased by 37 ; 
 Heart Failure decreased by 16 ; 
 Diabetes-related deaths decreased by 21 ; and 
 Myocardial infarction decreased by 14 . 3 
 
 Blood pressure 
 
 After seven weeks of treatments, systolic pressure, the higher amount of pressure in the arteries during the contraction of the heart muscle, declined by 9.6 from 142 to 128 millimeters of mercury and stabilized at the lower level through to the end of the Clinical Study. During the same period, diastolic pressure, the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is between beats, and which is usually represented by a lower number, declined by 10.4 from 78 to 70 millimeters of mercury and also remained at the lower level. The Company has been encouraged to undertake further studies on subjects with higher blood pressures to determine if a proportional effect is obtained. 
 
 Pain and numbness 
 
 Neuropathy is nerve damage that can occur with diabetes as a result of high blood glucose levels and high blood pressure. The damage most often affects the extremities and causes pain, tingling or numbness in the hands, arms, legs and feet. Only two subjects suffered from pain at the beginning of the Clinical Study and both reported feeling either less pain or reduced coldness or numbness in their extremities. These findings support the Company s in-house informal observation and testing results with a number of people who have used eBalance device. Future studies may recruit subjects who are experiencing pain and loss of feeling.

 5 

Kidney function (Nephropathy) 
 
 Nephropathy is damage caused to the small blood vessels in the kidneys by high blood glucose levels and high blood pressure that prevents them from functioning properly or even causes them to fail completely. When the blood vessels in the kidneys are injured, the kidneys cannot clean the blood properly. The body will retain more water and salt than it should, which can result in weight gain and edema. The decrease in eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) observed in the Clinical Study and a reduction in edema seen in our informal testing may warrant further investigation to assess the effect of eBalance treatments on kidney function in diabetics. 
 
 Product Development 
 
 On October 1, 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Mr. Claudio Tassi (the Development Agreement for the development of the first eBalance Professional Series Device (the Prototype ). Based on the Development Agreement we agreed to pay Bioformed Aestetic SL Bio4Med ), a company Mr. Tassi is a director of, 12,848 (EURO 12,000) and, upon successful completion of the development of the first eBalance Prototype, to issue to Mr. Tassi 100,000 shares of our common stock. We received the first Prototype in November 2015. 
 
 On December 4, 2015, we executed a non-binding letter of intent LOI with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med. The LOI contemplated that (i) we will enter into a technology development and license agreements with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med to continue development of therapeutic devices based on the eBalance Technology; (ii) upon approval of the first Prototype, we will place an order for the production of 25 devises; and (iii) Mr. Tassi will provide his services for an initial term of four months commencing on December 4, 2015. 
 
 On December 15, 2015, as contemplated under the LOI, we ordered the first batch which consisted of 25 eBalance Pro devices with the same configuration as the original Prototype, which were manufactured in early 2016. These devices were designed as a stand-alone unit, controlled by proprietary software installed in an external computer specifically designed to be used with the eBalance device. Once internally tested, the devices were distributed to selected clinics and practitioners as well as used directly by the Company in our in-house observations to see the effects of the eBalance Therapy on the human body. 
 
 After several months of testing, we received a feedback from the clinicians and participants, which allowed for further refinement of the devices, which were limited to aesthetics and ease of use. The Company ordered from Bio4Med 20 units of the second generation eBalance device, which were received in December 2016. These devices were also distributed to practitioners and other participants for observations and further testing. 
 
 In early 2017 the management decided to discontinue negotiations with Bio4Med on technology development and license agreements, as contemplated under the LOI, and chose to move manufacturing of the eBalance devices to Canada. The decision to move to Canada was the outcome of further research we had done on potential markets, tax implications of manufacturing the devices in Europe versus in Canada, cross border transfer pricing, availability of raw material and the control of the production processes. As such, in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2017, we entered into a production agreement with an ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility in Coquitlam, BC, and selected other local suppliers for sourcing essential components. 
 
 On October 16, 2017, we entered into a production development agreement (the Development Agreement with Western Robotics Ltd. Western Robotics with an objective to enhance our eBalance device based on the findings from the Clinical Study and the Company s ongoing in-house observations. The Company paid Western Robotics CAD 250,000 for the initial re-engineering of the eBalance devices. 
 
 During the 3rd quarter of our Fiscal 2019, we completed manufacturing of the first batch of the Canadian-built eBalance devices. The new eBalance Devices were certified by LabTest Certification Inc. as Class A (professional use) and Class B (in-home use) devices, and conform to CSA, CE and UL standards for electrical safety and emission standards, and are eligible to bear the LabTest Certification Mark with adjacent indicators C and US . 
 
 Majority of the eBalance devices manufactured in the third quarter of our Fiscal 2019 were used for further in-house observations as well as for promotional and introductory material. 
 
 The successful completion of the first batch of Canadian-built eBalance Systems allowed the Company to continue manufacturing, research and development, along with testing of the eBalance Systems. As of the date of this Annual 
 6 
 
 Report, the Company s products based on eBalance Technology include two Health Canada Class II Medical Device Systems - the eBalance Pro System, and eBalance Home System. Due to the financial difficulties the Company faces, the Company was required to stop any further research and development, and the management decided to let its MDSAP certification lapse, which resulted in the Company losing the Medical Device Licenses granted for its eBalance Home and Pro systems in June of 2023. 
 
 eBalance Home and Pro Systems 
 
 The eBalance Home and Pro Systems include the eBalance Console which acts as the central controller for three pre-programmed microcurrent algorithms (Wellness, Pain Management, and Dual) referred to as Treatment Options. In eBalance Pro System the Treatments are administered to patients using Hand Bars, Foot Plates, and/or Pen Probes. The eBalance Pro System is designed for Professional Use by Healthcare practitioners in a clinical setting. The Hand Bars and Foot Plates are used for general wellness and pain management while the Pen Probes are used in localized pain management. In eBalance Home System the Treatments are administered using Hand Bars and Foot Plates and are controlled by the eBalance Console. The eBalance Home System is for Home Use and is available without a prescription. 
 
 Research and development, including FDA and MDSAP audits are costly, and require large financing. Currently, we do not have the required financing in place, and therefore we stopped all our plans to progress eBalance Home and Pro Systems to market. We are continuing our efforts to raise capital through debt or equity financing or a combination of both, however, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have not been successful in securing sufficient funding to restart our development and licensing efforts. We are considering other alternatives to financing through joint-venturing and/or licensing further development of the eBalance Technology. 
 
 Medical Device Regulations and Government Approvals 
 
 The manufacture, packaging, marketing and importing of medical devices is heavily regulated in the United States, Canada and Europe. Further, we expect that any other countries in which we may seek to sell or market devices based on the eBalance Technology will similarly have an extensive regulatory environment. 
 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, re-label and/or import medical devices sold in the United States. Health Canada s Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate is responsible for regulating the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution and import of medical devices sold in Canada. 
 
 At the end of February 2020, we completed an audit required for certification of our quality management systems QMS under Stage 2 Medical Device Single Audit Program MDSAP and under ISO 13485:2016 standard. The audit was carried out by BSI Group Canada Inc. BSI and included the following: 
 
 The effectiveness of our QMS incorporating the applicable regulatory requirements outlined by ISO13485:2016 standard and as required under MDSAP; 
 Product/process-related technologies; 
 Adequate technical documentation for our eBalance device in relation to ISO13485:2016 standard and MDSAP; and 
 Our ability to comply with these requirements. 
 
 The assessment report was finalized in mid-March 2020, and on March 31, 2020, the Company received Certificate No. FM 716345, certifying that the Company operates a Quality Management System which complies with the requirements of ISO 13485:2016 for design, development and manufacture of microcurrent therapeutic devices for wellness and pain relief, and on June 2, 2020, received a certificate #MDSAP 716274. 
 
 Following the receipt of ISO and MDSAP certificates, we filed two separate applications for Class II Medical Device Licenses for the eBalance Pro System and the eBalance Home System with Health Canada. On July 17, 2020, Health Canada issued a Class II Medical Device License #104925 for our eBalance Home System, and on August 18, 2020, issued a Class II Medical Device License #105044 for our eBalance Pro System. 
 
 In order to keep the Class II Medical Licenses valid, the Company is required to go through annual MDSAP audits, for which, as at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company did not have adequate financing, and 
 7 
 
 therefore the 2022-23 audit was cancelled, resulting in cancellation of the Class II Medical Device Licenses by Health Canada. 
 
 Prior to selling our eBalance Home and Pro Systems for the treatment in the United States, the Company will be required to apply for an approval from the FDA. We were in the process of completing the necessary documentation and testing required for the 510(K) submission to the FDA, however, due to the financial situation of the Company, the process was stopped, and will most likely result in our application expiring. 
 
 The cancellation of Class II Medical Device Licenses by Health Canada resulted in us suspending all our revenue-generating activities associated with sales of eBalance Home and Pro Systems, as well as monthly recurring revenue from the online sales of eBalance treatment packages. 
 
 Third Party Payers / Private Insurers 
 
 Reimbursement for medical devices through Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., and through health protectorates in other nations, is not guaranteed. Third party private payers or private insurers typically follow the lead of government healthcare providers. A decision as to whether a device or treatment is covered involves extensive negotiations and is typically predicated on the concept of health cost savings. If the device can be shown to reduce health care costs through prevention of expensive complications of diabetes, such applications for approvals would be more favorably reviewed. 
 
 Marketing Plans 
 
 On March 21, 2019, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement (the Agreement with Live Current Media, Inc. LIVC for worldwide distribution rights to eBalance devices in an end-user market (the Direct Rights ). John da Costa, Cell MedX s director and COO, was a director of LIVC until his resignation in April of 2022, Mr. David Jeffs, a son of Mr. Richard Jeffs, Cell MedX s largest shareholder, was a director and President of LIVC until May 24, 2023. LIVC paid an initial one-time fee of 250,000. In order to maintain the exclusivity, LIVC will be required to order a minimum of 2,000 devices by the end of a 24-month period from the date the eBalance device receives its 510K clearance from the FDA (the Initial Term ). The Company agreed to sell the eBalance devices to LIVC at a 20 discount to the regular retail price in place at the time of the order (the License Fee ), with 50 of the License Fee payable at the time of placing an order, and remaining 50 payable on the specified delivery date of the devices. In addition, the Company agreed that during the Initial Term the License Fee for the eBalance devices will be fixed at CAD 2,400 per device. In addition to the License Fee, LIVC was required to pay a monthly recurring fee per each eBalance device equal to 50 of the regular monthly home-use fee set by the Company. Following the Initial Term, the minimum monthly fee was to be 100,000. 
 
 On January 29, 2020, the Company reacquired the Direct Rights from LIVC in exchange for a royalty on all sales of the eBalance device up to an aggregate 507,500 calculated as follows: 
 
 1. 25 per eBalance device sold, not to exceed 3,500 eBalance devices; and 
 2. 5 per month for each eBalance device generating recurring monthly revenue, up to an aggregate royalty of 420,000. 
 
 Should the recurring monthly fee be cancelled due to a change in the Company s distribution model, the royalty will be replaced by a one-time payment of 145 per eBalance device sold up to an aggregate of 507,500. 
 
 In addition to the royalty, the Company issued to LIVC share purchase warrants (the Warrants entitling LIVC to purchase up to two million shares of the Company s common stock, however, these Warrants expired unexercised on March 3, 2023. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The market for treatments that assist in the control and management of diabetes, its complications, as well as other ailments, including pain management, are highly competitive. However, since the Company s eBalance Pro and eBalance Home Systems are based on the microcurrent therapy, which is not yet widely accepted in traditional medicine, direct competition for these Systems is not well defined. 
 8 
 
 Indirect competitors include a multitude of pharmaceutical companies that produce various drugs to maintain and prevent diabetes related complications; companies producing glucose monitoring devices, other pharmaceuticals to treat diseases and symptoms. 
 
 Competitors in electrical/microcurrent therapies include BodiHealth Systems, focusing on pain relief market in US; Electromedical Products International, Inc., the company that developed Alpha-Stim PPM, which treats and alleviates acute, chronic or postoperative pain using microcurrent therapy, and several other companies currently involved in the microcurrent and electrical current therapies. 
 
 Patents/Trademarks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts 
 
 The Company s eBalance Technology is not patented. 
 
 On August 10, 2021, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office approved the Company s EBALANCE trademark application number 1867918, which the Company filed on November 14, 2017, and issued a certificate of registration number 1,104,935 registering the trademark EBALANCE in the name of the Company. Earlier, on May 8, 2019, the European Union approved the Company s eBalance trademark application and issued certificate of registration number 017997155 registering the trademark eBalance in the name of the Company. The eBalance trademark was also registered in the U.K., bearing the registration number UK00003345540. On March 15, 2022, United States Patent and Trademarks Office issued a certificate of registration number 6,669,175 registering the trademark EBALANCE in the name of the Company. 
 
 On September 6, 2018, the Company entered into an IP Royalty Agreement with an IP Vendor. Pursuant to the IP Royalty Agreement the Company agreed to acquire certain additional developments and improvements for its eBalance devices that were developed by the IP Vendor in exchange for a perpetual royalty of US 350 or CAD 350, depending on the currency the revenue is generated in, for each device sold, distributed, or licensed whether through a distributor, sales representative or by the Company itself. 
 
 Also on September 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Royalty Agreement with Mr. Richard Jeffs, the Company s major shareholder. Pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Jeffs, in perpetuity, a 10 royalty on the revenue the Company receives from its distributors or end-users introduced to the Company by Mr. Jeffs. 
 
 Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees 
 
 We currently have no employees other than our executive officers, who provide their services as independent consultants. We contract for the services of medical and technical staff we require to administer our observational studies and the clinical trials, as well as other consultants on as needed basis. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 There is a high degree of risk associated with buying our common stock. Prospective investors should carefully read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and consider the following risk factors when deciding whether to purchase our shares. These are speculative stocks and should be purchased by only those who can afford to lose their entire investment. 
 
 The risk factors outlined below are some of the known, substantial, material and potential risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and common share value. We cannot assure that we will successfully address these or any unknown risks and a failure to do so can have a negative impact on your investment. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. 
 
 Risks Associated with our Company and our Industry 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive market. We face competition from large, well established medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in the market for treatment of pain and management of diabetes and related ailments. Many of these companies are very well accepted by health practitioners and have significant resources, and we may not be able to compete effectively. 
 9 

The market for treatment and management of diabetes and related ailments is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. We compete indirectly with pharmaceutical and medical device companies, such as Bayer Corp., Becton Dickinson Corp., LifeScan Inc., a division of Johnson Johnson, the MediSense Inc., and TheraSense Inc. These competitors products are based on traditional healthcare model and are well accepted by health practitioners and patients. If these companies decide to penetrate our target market they could threaten our position in the market. 
 
 We are subject to numerous governmental regulations which can increase our costs of developing the eBalance Technology and products based on this technology. 
 
 Our products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals may not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, our products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable FDA, Health Canada and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, advertising, and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. 
 
 Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect our business. 
 
 A number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and its amendments changed access to health care products and services and established new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking. 
 
 Inability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 Intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, tradenames, and other forms of trade dress, are important to our business. An inability to defend, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial results, even if we are successful in developing and marketing products based on the eBalance Technology. In addition, an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties. In addition, a finding that any of our intellectual property rights are invalid could allow our competitors to compete more easily and cost-effectively. Thus, an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 The cost to us of any patent litigation or interference proceeding could be substantial. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or interference proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and interference proceedings could also absorb significant management time. 
 
 Competitors intellectual property may prevent us from selling our products or have a material adverse effect on our future profitability and financial condition. 
 
 Competitors may claim that our technology infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require us to enter into license agreements. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject us to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of our product. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. 
 
 Our research and development efforts may not result in the development of commercially successful products based on our eBalance Technology, which may hinder our profitability and future growth. 
 10 

We continue to further research our eBalance Technology and develop products based on the technology. In order to develop commercially marketable products, we will be required to commit substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. We must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that our efforts will be commercially successful. 
 
 Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Planned products may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. 
 
 Even if we successfully develop marketable products or commercially develop our current technology, we may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors innovations. 
 
 Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. We cannot state with certainty when or whether our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire new products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete, causing our revenues and operating results to suffer. 
 
 New products and technological advances by our competitors may negatively affect our results of operations. 
 
 Our products face intense competition from our competitors. Competitors products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than our products. We cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products. 
 
 Significant safety concerns could arise for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition. 
 
 Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, we may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, we may be required to provide additional warnings on a product s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with our product, sales of the product could be halted by us or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers or competitors products also may reduce the market acceptance of our products. 
 
 Inability to attract and maintain key personnel may cause our business to fail. 
 
 Success depends on the acquisition of key personnel. We will have to compete with other companies both within and outside the healthcare industry to recruit and retain competent employees and consultants. If we cannot maintain qualified personnel to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, we could face material adverse effects on our business and financial condition. 
 
 We are recently formed, lack operating history and to date have generated only minimal revenues. If we cannot increase our revenues to start generating profits, our investors may lose their entire investment. 
 
 We are a recently formed company and to date have generated only minimal revenues. No profits have been made to date and if we fail to make any then we may fail as a business and an investment in our common stock will be worth nothing. We have a limited operating history and thus our progress as well as potential future success cannot be reasonably estimated. Success has yet to be proven and financial losses should be expected to continue in the near future and at least until such time that we enter commercial production of devices based on the eBalance Technology, of which there is no assurance. As a new business, we face all the risks of a start-up venture including unforeseen costs, expenses, problems, and management limitations and difficulties. Since inception, we have an accumulated 
 11 
 
 deficit of 10,152,777 and there is no guarantee, that we may ever be able to turn a profit or locate additional opportunities, hire additional management and other personnel. 
 
 We need to acquire additional financing, or our business will fail. 
 
 We must obtain additional capital, or our business will fail. In order to continue development of our eBalance Technology, apply for medical licenses, FDA approvals, and to carry our additional observational and clinical trials, we must secure more funds. Currently, we have limited resources and have already accumulated a deficit. We do not have immediate sources of financing. Financing may be subject to numerous factors including investor sentiment, acceptance of our technology and so on. We may also have to borrow large sums of money that require substantial capital and interest payments. 
 
 Risks related to our stock 
 
 We expect to raise additional capital through the offering of more shares, which will result in dilution to our current shareholders. 
 
 Raising additional capital through future offerings of common stock is expected to be necessary for our Company to continue. However, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in raising additional capital. Issuance of additional stock will increase the total number of shares issued and outstanding resulting in decrease of the percentage interest held by each of our shareholders. 
 
 We expect to convert some of the existing debt into shares of our common stock, which will result in dilution to our current shareholders. 
 
 In order to reduce our liabilities and improve our financial position we may convert some of the debt to shares of our common stock. Issuance of additional stock will increase the total number of shares issued and outstanding resulting in decrease of the percentage interest held by each of our shareholders further diluting their position. 
 
 Due to the current financial situation, and to improve likelihood of successful financing in the future we may decide to consolidated issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 
 In order to improve our financial position we may elect to consolidate our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The effect of a share consolidation on the per share trading price of the Company s common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of share consolidations for other companies is varied, particularly since some investors may view a share consolidation negatively. It is possible that the per share trading price of the Company s common stock after a share consolidation would not increase in the same proportion as the reduction in the number of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock following the share consolidation or at all, and a share consolidation may not result in a per share trading price that would attract investors who do not trade in lower priced stocks. The Company cannot assure you that, if a share consolidation is implemented, its common stock will be more attractive to investors. If the Company implements a share consolidation, the per share trading price of its common stock may decrease due to factors unrelated to the share consolidation, including its future performance. If a share consolidation is consummated and the per share trading price of the Company s common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of the Company s overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of a share consolidation. 
 
 A share consolidation may decrease the liquidity of the Company s common stock and result in higher transaction costs. The liquidity of the Company s common stock may be negatively impacted by a share consolidation, given the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the share consolidation, particularly if the per share trading price does not increase as a result of the share consolidation. In addition, if a share consolidation is implemented, it will increase the number of the Company s stockholders who own odd lots of fewer than 100 shares of common stock. Brokerage commission and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally higher than the costs of transactions of more than 100 shares of common stock. 
 
 12 

There is a limited market for our common stock meaning that our shareholders may not be able to resell their shares. 
 
 Our common stock currently has a limited market which may restrict shareholders ability to resell their stock or use their stock as collateral. Thus, the shareholders may have to sell their shares privately which may prove exceedingly difficult. Private sales are more difficult and often give lower than anticipated prices. 
 
 Should a larger public market develop for our stock, future sales of shares may negatively affect their market price. 
 
 Even if a larger market develops, the shares may be sparsely traded and have wide share price fluctuations. Liquidity may be low despite there being a market, making it difficult to get a return on the investment. The price also depends on potential investor s feelings regarding the results of our operations, the competition of other companies shares, our ability to generate future revenues, and market perception about future of microcurrent technologies. 
 
 Because our stock is a penny stock, stockholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock. 
 
 The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system. 
 
 Because our securities constitute penny stocks within the meaning of the rules, the rules apply to us and to our securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them. As long as the quotation price of our common stock is less than 5.00 per share, the common stock will be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: 
 
 contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; 
 contains a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws; 
 contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; 
 contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; 
 defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and 
 contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size, and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. 
 
 The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock. 
 
 We have not paid nor anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock. 
 
 We have not declared any dividends on our common stock during the past two fiscal years or at any time in our history. The Nevada Revised Statutes (the NRS ), provide certain limitations on our ability to declare dividends. Section 78.288 of Chapter 78 of the NRS prohibits us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 
 
 (a) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 
 13 
 
 (b) except as may be allowed by our Articles of Incorporation, our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders who may have preferential rights and whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. 
 
 We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future as we expect to spend any funds legally available for the payment of dividends on the development of our business. 
 
 We are an OTC reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws. The British Columbia Securities Commission has issued a cease trade order in respect of our securities for failing to comply with our reporting obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws. 
 
 As an OTC reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws, we are required to make periodic filings with applicable Canadian securities authorities, including annual and interim financial statements and management s discussion analysis relating to those periods. Due to a lack of sufficient funds, we were late filing our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, and for the interim periods ended August 31, 2022, November 30, 2022, and February 28, 2023. On October 11, 2022, the British Columbia Securities Commission issued a cease trade order (the CTO in respect of our securities. As a result of this order, holders of our securities in Canada will not be able to trade in our securities until the order is revoked. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in a process of gathering all required information to submit a request to the British Columbia Securities Commission to lift the CTO on the grounds that we had filed all required regulatory filings. 
 
 No assurance that forward-looking assessments will be realized. 
 
 Our ability to accomplish our objectives and whether or not we are financially successful is dependent upon numerous factors, each of which could have a material effect on the results obtained. Some of these factors are in the discretion and control of management and others are beyond management s control. The assumptions and hypotheses used in preparing any forward-looking assessments contained herein are considered reasonable by management. There can be no assurance, however, that any projections or assessments contained herein or otherwise made by management will be realized or achieved at any level. 
 
 FOR ALL OF THE AFORESAID REASONS AND OTHERS SET-FORTH AND NOT SET-FORTH HEREIN, AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES INVOLVES A CERTAIN DEGREE OF RISK. ANY PERSON CONSIDERING TO INVEST IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD BE AWARE OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS SET-FORTH IN THIS REPORT AND IN THE OTHER REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT WE FILE FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE SEC AND SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS/HER LEGAL, TAX, AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS PRIOR TO MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY PERSONS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR TOTAL INVESTMENT .

 HOLDERS OF RECORD 
 
 As of September 1, 2023, we had approximately 54 holders of record, according to a shareholders list provided by our transfer agent as of that date. The number of registered shareholders does not include the beneficial owners of common stock held in street name. The transfer agent for Cell MedX s common stock is Pacific Stock Transfer Company with an address at 6725 Via Austi Pkwy, Suite 300 Las Vegas, NV 89119, and their telephone number is 702-361-3033. 
 
 DIVIDENDS 
 
 We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain our earnings, if any, to provide funds for the expansion of our business. 
 
 Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not contain any restrictions limiting our ability to declare dividends. Section 78.288 of the Nevada Revised Statutes prohibits us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 
 
 (a) we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 
 
 (b) our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders who may have preferential rights and whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. 
 
 RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES 
 
 None. 
 
 PENNY STOCK RULES 
 
 The SEC has adopted regulations that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally defined as being any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 
 15 
 
 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. The application of the penny stock rules may affect your ability to resell our securities.

Revenues 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2023, we recognized 2,762 in revenue, which consisted of 1,138 in revenue from sales of eBalance devices and 1,624 we received from monthly recurring revenue associated with the eBalance treatment packages. The cost attributed to this revenue was 2,279. 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2022, we recognized 6,065 in revenue, which consisted of 2,387 in revenue from sales of eBalance devices and 3,678 we received from monthly recurring revenue associated with the eBalance treatment packages. The cost attributed to this revenue was 2,032. 
 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we suspended research and further development of our eBalance Technology and devices based on this technology due to lack of available financing for this project. As of May 31, 2023, due to cancellation of Health Canada Class II Medical Device licenses for our eBalance Pro System, and eBalance Home System, we also suspended all our revenue-generating activities associate with sales of eBalance Home and Pro Systems, as well as monthly recurring revenue from the online sales of eBalance treatment packages. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2023, our operating expenses decreased by 33.7 from 675,726 incurred during the year ended May 31, 2022, to 448,141 incurred during the year ended May 31, 2023. The most significant changes were as follows: 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2023, our consulting fees decreased by 106,262, or 56 , from 189,649 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2022, to 83,387 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2023. 
 
 Our research and development fees for the year ended May 31, 2023, decreased by 61,489, or 40.8 , from 150,709 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2022, to 89,220 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2023. The lower research and development fees during the year ended May 31, 2023, were associated with our decision to suspend further development of the eBalance devices due to lack of funding and unfavorable financial position. 
 
 Our general and administrative fees for the year ended May 31, 2023, decreased by 58,689, or 18 , from 334,223 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2022, to 275,534 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2023. The largest factor that contributed to this change was associated with our expenditures on corporate communications, which decreased by 108,825 to 20,902 we recorded during the year ended May 31, 2023, as compared to 129,727 we incurred during the year ended May 31, 2022. This reduction was associated with lack of funding and overall unfavorable financial position. Our filing and regulatory fees decreased by 14,945 to 16,755, and our audit and accounting fees decreased by 4,197 to 36,017. These decreases were in part offset by 54,000 increase to our management fees to 105,000, which were associated with an engagement of our new CEO, and by 30,153 increase in loss on foreign exchange to 83,918. 
 
 Other Items 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2023, we accrued 47,384 (May 31, 2022 - 25,686) in interest associated with the outstanding notes payable.

During the year ended May 31, 2023, we funded our operations with 169,987 we borrowed from Mr. Richard Jeffs under loan agreements accumulating interest at 6 per annum, compounded monthly, and due on demand, 30,000 we borrowed from Mr. David Jeffs under loan agreement accumulating interest at 10 per annum, compounded monthly, which was initially payable on April 24, 2023, and as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is due on demand, 6,377 (CAD 10,000) we borrowed from Mr. David Jeffs under loan agreement accumulating interest at 10 per annum, compounded monthly and payable on demand, 30,000 we borrowed under a 10 loan agreement, compounded monthly, which was initially payable on April 24, 2023, and as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is due on demand, and further 110,000 we borrowed under 10 loan agreements, compounded monthly, and payable on demand. 
 
 We did not generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities to satisfy our cash requirements for the year ended May 31, 2023. The amount of cash we have generated from our operations to date is significantly less than our current debt obligations. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from our operations to repay the amounts owing under the outstanding notes and advances payable, or to service our other debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay the amounts owing when due, we may be required to raise additional financing from other sources. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raises substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended May 31, 2023, was 272,209. This cash was primarily used to cover our cash operating activities of 376,517, which were represented by net loss of 495,042 reduced by the non-cash items totaling 118,525, and to decrease our accounts payable by 14,064. These uses of cash were offset by 99,194 increase in amounts due to related parties, 11,408 decrease to our current assets which include GST receivable and prepaid expenses, and 7,770 increase in accrued liabilities. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended May 31, 2022, was 450,591. This cash was primarily used to cover our cash operating expenses of 588,567, which were represented by net loss of 697,379 reduced by the non-cash items totaling 108,812, and to decrease accrued liabilities by 6,302. These uses of cash were offset by 112,115 increase in amounts due to related parties, 19,953 increase in our accounts payable, and by 12,210 decrease in our other current assets. 
 
 Non-cash transactions 
 
 During the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was affected by the following expenses that did not have any impact on cash used in operations: 
 
 47,384 (May 31, 2022 - 25,686) in interest we accrued on the outstanding notes payable; 
 
 71,141 in unrealized foreign exchange loss (May 31, 2022 - 44,906), which resulted from fluctuations of Canadian dollar, the functional currency of Cell MedX Canada, in relation to US dollar, the functional currency of our parent company, being also our reporting currency; 
 
 Nil (May 31, 2022 - 1,145) in amortization of equipment we acquired for our manufacturing operations and for our office; and 
 18 
 
 Nil (May 31, 2022 - 37,075) in non-cash investor relations expenses which were associated with fair market value of the shares we issued to our consultants for investor relation services. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 We did not have any investing activities during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2023, we received 169,987 under a number of loan agreements with Mr. Jeffs, which are payable on demand and accumulate interest at 6 per annum. On October 12, 2022, we reached an agreement with Mr. Jeffs to amend certain terms included in the loan agreements with him totaling 539,325. Under the amended terms, upon a default of any payment of the amount owed under the amended loan agreements, Mr. Jeffs will have full right and title of ownership to our eBalance Technology and any and all products developed by us and our subsidiary that are based on the eBalance Technology, as well as all eBalance trademarks and certifications we were granted. All other terms of the loan agreements, including repayment date and interest rate, remained substantially the same. 
 
 In addition to loans from Mr. Richard Jeffs, we received 36,377 under loan agreements with Mr. David Jeffs, 90,000 under loan agreements with Mr. Vahabzadeh, the Company s shareholder, and an additional 50,000 under a loan agreement with a lender. These loans accumulate interest at 10 per annum, compounded monthly, a total of 60,000 in principal were due on April 24, 2023, with the remaining loans due on demand. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the loan agreements due on April 24, 2023, are in default and payable on demand. 
 
 During the year ended May 31, 2022, we received 288,096 under loan agreements with Mr. Jeffs, which are payable on demand and accumulate interest at 6 per annum, we received an additional 5,875 from Mr. Hargreaves, our VP of Technology and Operations; this loan is also payable on demand and accumulates interest at 6 per annum. In addition, we received 100,000 on closing of a non-brokered private placement for 400,000 shares of our common stock at 0.25 per share. We did not incur any share-issuance costs associated with the shares issued as part of the private placement financing. And we received further 60,000 on exercise of the warrants to acquire 300,000 shares of our common stock at 0.20 per share. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The notes to our audited consolidated financial statements at May 31, 2023, disclose our uncertain ability to continue as a going concern. Our current business operations are in an early development stage and as such, we were able to generate only minimal revenue from the operations. Our research and development as well as marketing plans require large capital expenditures. Due to the financial difficulties the Company faces, we decided to abandon the research and development plans associated with our eBalance technology, until such time that the Company has regained its financial stability. The management is planning to mitigate the Company s shortfall in funds through equity or debt financing. 
 
 As at May 31, 2023, we had accumulated a deficit of 10,152,777 since inception and increased sales will be required to fund and support our operations. Our continuation as a going concern depends upon the continued financial support of our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in our financial statements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 None. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes 
 19 
 
 depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We have applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently. 
 
 Principals of consolidation 
 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cell MedX Corp. and our Subsidiary. On consolidation we eliminate all intercompany balances and transactions. 
 
 Foreign currency translations and transactions 
 
 Our functional and reporting currency is the United States dollar. We translate foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities into their U.S. dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Related translation adjustments as well as gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported as part of operating expenses on the statement of operations. 
 
 The functional currency of our Subsidiary is the Canadian dollar. On consolidation, the Subsidiary translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date, and translates revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the other comprehensive income. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 
 Revenue recognition 
 
 Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that is expected to be received by the Company for providing goods or services under a contract with a customer, which is initially estimated with pricing specified in the contract and adjusted primarily for sales returns, discounts and other credits at contract inception then updated each reporting period, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a contract with a customer exists and a performance obligation is identified and satisfied as the customer obtains control of the goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue on the monthly eBalance treatment packages in the month the packages are provided. 
 
 Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 
 
 Inventory valuation 
 
 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of trade discounts received, with costs being determined based on the weighted average cost basis. 
 
 Research and development costs 
 
 The Company expenses all in-house research and development costs in the period they were incurred. Acquired research and development costs are capitalized to the extent that the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset can be reasonably estimated or may be verified by an appraisal in certain instances. In all other instances the costs are expensed in the period they were incurred. Acquired research and development costs for a particular research and development project that have no future economic values, are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 Income tax expense is based on pre-tax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carry forwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the 
 20 
 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 Income/Loss per share 
 
 The Company s basic income/loss per share EPS is calculated by dividing its net income/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested portion of restricted stock with performance conditions. 
 
 The Company s diluted EPS is calculated by dividing its net income/loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. 
 
 The outstanding securities at May 31, 2023 and 2022 that could have a dilutive effect are as follows: 

May 31, 2023 
 
 May 31, 2022 
 
 Share purchase options 
 
 - 

2,050,000 
 
 Share purchase warrants 
 
 - 

2,988,000 
 
 Total Possible Dilutive Shares 
 
 - 

5,038,000 

For the year ended May 31, 2022, the effect of the Company s outstanding share purchase options and warrants would have been anti-dilutive and therefore they were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. 
 
 Long-lived assets 
 
 In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds fair value. 
 
 Equipment 
 
 Equipment is stated at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis over two years. All our equipment was fully amortized during the year ended May 31, 2022. We did not acquire any new equipment during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Fair value measurements 
 
 The book value of cash, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, notes and advances payable, and due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following: 
 
 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 
 Level 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and 
 
 Level 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
 21 

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Stock options and other stock-based compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for the granting of share purchase options to employees using the fair value method whereby all awards to employees are recorded at fair value on the date of the grant. The fair value of all share purchase options is expensed over their vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional capital surplus. Upon exercise of share purchase options, the consideration paid by the option holder, together with the amount previously recognized in additional paid-in capital is recorded as an increase to share capital. 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share purchase options. Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. 
 
 Recent accounting pronouncements 
 
 Recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative standards groups with future effective dates are either not applicable or are not expected to be significant to the financial statements of the Company.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the shareholders and the board of directors of Cell MedX Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cell MedX Corp. (the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows, for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has not generated revenues since inception, has incurred losses in developing its business, and further losses are anticipated. The Company requires additional funds to meet its obligations and the costs of its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in this regard are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. 

F-1 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 MAY 31, 2023 
 
 . Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to meet obligations and pay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due and ultimately upon its ability to achieve profitable operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time and raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management intends to obtain additional funding by borrowing funds from its directors and officers, issuing promissory notes and/or a private placement of common stock.

 Not applicable 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act )) as of May 31, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Based on that evaluation, our management concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms due to lack of segregation of duties. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our Board of Directors; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). As a result of this assessment, it was found that the internal controls cannot be relied upon due to lack of segregation of duties. 

23 

Our independent auditors have not issued an attestation report on management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, this Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 BCSC Cease Trade Order 
 
 On October 11, 2022, the British Columbia Securities Commission (the BCSC issued a cease trade order (the CTO in respect of the securities of the Company for failing to timely file its Annual Information Form (AIF), annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, and the related management s discussion and analysis (collectively, the Canadian Filings ). The Company s inability to file the required Canadian Filings is due to the Company having insufficient funds to complete the audit of its annual financial statements. The Company had filed its Canadian Filings on April 7, 2023, filed its quarterly report for the period ended August 31, 2022 on April 19, 2023, for the period ended November 30, 2022 on May 19, 2023, and for the period ended February 28, 2023 on June 29, 2023. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is in a process of gathering all required information to submit a request to the BCSC to lift the CTO on the grounds that the Company had filed all required regulatory filings. 
 
 Delisting from OTCQB Market Tier 
 
 Our securities currently trade on OTC Pink tier operated by OTC Markets. During the year ended May 31, 2023, the Company was in default of Section 2.2 of the OTCQB Standards relating to the Company s ongoing disclosure obligations due to the late filing of its annual report for the year ended May 31, 2022, and for non-filing of the quarterly reports for the interim periods ended August 31, 2022, November 30, 2022 and February 28, 2023. The Company had filed its annual report for the year ended May 31, 2022, on April 7, 2023, filed its quarterly report for the period ended August 31, 2022 on April 19, 2023, for the period ended November 30, 2022 on May 19, 2023, and for the period ended February 28, 2023 on June 29, 2023, and therefore the Company is now current with all its filing obligations under Section 2.2 of the OTCQB Standards.

 Nomination Procedure for Directors 
 
 We do not have a standing nominating committee. Recommendations for candidates to stand for election as directors are made by our Board of Directors. In carrying out their responsibilities, the Board of Directors will consider candidates suggested by stockholders. If a stockholder wishes to formally place a candidate s name in nomination, however, he or she must do so in accordance with the provisions of the Company s Bylaws.

 Identification of Audit Committee 
 
 We do not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. Rather, our entire Board of Directors performs the required functions of an audit committee. 
 
 Our audit committee is responsible for: (1) selection and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; (3) establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding accounting and auditing matters; (4) engaging outside advisors; and, (5) funding for the outside auditory and any outside advisors engagement by the audit committee. 
 
 As of May 31, 2023, we did not have a written audit committee charter or similar document and have not adopted any specific policies or procedures for the engagement of non-audit services. 
 
 Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 
 John da Costa, our COO and a member of our Board of Directors, and Dwayne Yaretz, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors, qualify as audit committee financial experts , as defined by Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. da Costa and Mr. Yaretz are not independent directors, we believe that their experience in analyzing and evaluating financial statements, as well as their prior experience being on the board of directors of other public companies will provide us with the guidance we need until we are able to expand our board to include independent directors who have the knowledge and experience to serve on an audit committee. 
 
 Code of Ethics 
 
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all our executive officers and employees, including our CEO and CFO. Our Code of Ethics is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that our Code of Ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide accountability for adherence to the Code.

 ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL HOLDERS AND MANAGEMENT. 
 
 The following tables set forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially as of September 1, 2023, by: (i) each person (including any group) known to us to own more than five percent (5 of any class of our voting securities, (ii) each of our directors and each of our named executive officers (as defined under Item 402(m)(2) of Regulation S-K), and (iii) officers and directors as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, the shareholders listed possess sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. 
 
 Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following tables does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding. As of September 1, 2023, there were 62,923,063 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.
