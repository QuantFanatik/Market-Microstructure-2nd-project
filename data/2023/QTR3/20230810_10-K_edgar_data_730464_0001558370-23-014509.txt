Student Admissions and Admissions Standards Walden has a long-standing commitment to providing educational opportunities to a diverse group of learners across all degree levels. Walden s programs are enriched by the cultural, economic, and educational backgrounds of its students and instructors. In the admissions process, Walden selects individuals who can benefit from a distributed educational or online learning approach and who will use their Walden education to contribute to their academic or professional communities. For admissions review to take place, applicants must submit an online application for their intended program of study and an official transcript with a qualifying admitting degree from a U.S. school accredited by a regional, professional/specialized, or national accrediting organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation or the U.S. Department of Education ED ), or from an appropriately accredited non-U.S. institution.

Applicants with degrees and coursework from a non-U.S. institution have their academic record evaluated for comparability to a U.S. degree or coursework by our Global Transcript Evaluation GTE service offered by Walden or any credential evaluation service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services NACES or member of Association of International Credential Evaluators AICE ). Applicants may be offered conditional admission to Walden with a stipulation for academic performance at the level of a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher for master s and doctoral students or a cumulative grade point average

Applicants who have completed their secondary education from a country outside of the U.S. submit an official evaluation report completed by a member of NACES or the GTE service offered by Walden showing comparability to a U.S. high school diploma, along with a copy of their academic credential.

Walden Undergraduate Academy The Academy is a general education program of study for first-time undergraduates who do not have any college credit prior to coming to Walden. Students take their courses as a cohort in a lock-step manner. This does not change the 181-quarterly credit model for undergraduate programs, nor does it impact available concentrations. Instead, the lock-step nature of the general education curriculum provides additional support to students as they build their scholarly acumen. Master s and Master s Certificate The Master s program requires a minimum grade point average of 2.5 in bachelor s degree coursework or a 3.0 in master s degree coursework. Specific program requirements may apply. Master of Science in Nursing Two tracks are offered to licensed RNs who seek to enter the MSN program. The BSN track is for students with a BSN degree.

The advanced standing option is for students that hold a Bachelor of Social Work BSW degree from a Council on Social Work Education CSWE accredited program and graduated with a minimum grade point average of 3.0.

 Ph.D. in Public Health Walden offers two tracks for applicants. Applicants are eligible for track 1 if they have a MPH or a MS in Public Health. Applicants are eligible for track 2 if they have a bachelor s degree or higher in an academic discipline other than the public health field. Post-Master s Certificate A minimum grade point average of 3.0 in post-bachelor s degree coursework and three years of professional/academic experience related to the program for which application is made. Medical and Veterinary Together, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM, along with the Medical Education Readiness Program MERP and the Veterinary Preparation Program, had 4,869 students enrolled in the May 2023 semester, an 8.2 decrease compared to the same term last year. AUC and RUSM AUC, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2011, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is located in St. Maarten and is one of the most established international medical schools in the Caribbean, producing over 7,500 graduates from over 78 countries. The mission of AUC is to train tomorrow s physicians, whose service to their communities and their patients is enhanced by international learning experiences, a diverse learning community, and an emphasis on social accountability and engagement. RUSM, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. RUSM has graduated more than 15,000 physicians since inception. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective and successful physicians. RUSM seeks to accomplish this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills, and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician. In January 2019, RUSM moved its basic science instruction from Dominica to Barbados. AUC s and RUSM s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools as evidenced by student performance on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination USMLE tests and residency placement. AUC s and RUSM s programs consist of three academic semesters per year, which begin in January, May, and September, allowing students to begin their basic science instruction at the most convenient time for them. Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences after which they sit for Step 1 of the USMLE, which assesses whether students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine. Under AUC and RUSM direction, students then complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations conducted at over 40 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers connected with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Towards the end of the clinical training and prior to graduation, AUC and RUSM students take USMLE, Step 2 CK (Clinical Knowledge), which assesses ability to apply medical knowledge, skills, and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. Successfully passing USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills previously was a requirement for graduation and for certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates ECFMG to enter the U.S. residency match. USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills has been discontinued indefinitely. ECFMG has developed alternative pathways to replace this requirement, for which AUC and RUSM are generally eligible. Upon successful completion of their medical degree requirements, students apply for a residency position in their area of specialty through the National Residency Matching Program NRMP ). This process is also known as The Match and utilizes an algorithm to match applicants to programs using the certified rank order lists of the applicants and program directors. AUC students achieved an 84 and 77 first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Of first-time eligible AUC graduates, 96 and 97 attained residency positions in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

 RUSM students achieved an 83 and 81 first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Of first-time eligible RUSM graduates, 96 and 98 attained residency positions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In September 2019, AUC opened its medical education program in the U.K. in partnership with University of Central Lancashire UCLAN ). The program offers students a Post Graduate Diploma in International Medical Sciences from UCLAN, followed by their Doctor of Medicine degree from AUC. Students are eligible to do clinical rotations at AUC s clinical sites, which include hospitals in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. This program is aimed at preparing students for USMLEs. MERP is a 15-week medical school preparatory program focused on enhancing the academic foundation of prospective AUC and RUSM students and providing them with the skills they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians. Upon successful completion of the MERP program, students are guaranteed admission to AUC or RUSM. Data has shown that the performance of students who complete the MERP program is consistent with students who were admitted directly into medical school. RUSVM RUSVM, founded in 1982 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides veterinary education and confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, as well as Masters of Science and Ph.D. degrees. RUSVM is one of 54 American Veterinary Medical Association AVMA accredited veterinary education institutions in the world. RUSVM is located in St. Kitts and has graduated nearly 6,000 veterinarians since inception. The mission of RUSVM is to provide the best learning environment to prepare students to become members and leaders of the worldwide public and professional healthcare system and to advance human and animal health through research and knowledge exchange. The RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester, pre-clinical curriculum at the campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship under RUSVM direction lasting approximately 45 weeks at one of 31 clinical affiliates located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K. RUSVM offers a one-semester Veterinary Preparatory Program Vet Prep designed to enhance the pre-clinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school. The Vet Prep advancement rate for 2021-2022 was 76 , which represents the percent of Vet Prep students in 2020-2021 who started at RUSVM within one year. In 2020 and 2021, instruction for both the RUSVM and Vet Prep programs was partially offered online in response to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 travel restrictions. All students have returned to full-time instruction in St. Kitts. Student Admissions and Admissions Standards AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM employ regional admissions representatives in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada who provide information to students interested in their respective programs. A successful applicant must have completed the required prerequisite courses and, for AUC and RUSM, taken the Medical College Admission Test MCAT ), while RUSVM applicants are strongly encouraged but not required to have completed the Graduate Record Exam GRE ). Candidates for admission must interview with an admissions representative and all admission decisions are made by the admissions committees of the medical and veterinary schools. AUC allows several entrance examinations for its international students. The MCAT (and other entrance exams) requirement was temporarily waived as permitted by ED due to lack of availability of testing caused by COVID-19 closures, and later resumed for incoming May 2022 students. RUSVM began waiving their GRE requirements for incoming classes starting in January 2021 because of limited testing availability due to COVID-19. RUSVM later revised their policy to highly recommend but not require applicants to submit a GRE score, giving priority in the application review process for those who have taken the GRE.

Market Trends and Competition Chamberlain Chamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 2,000 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and diploma schools of nursing. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education. In the pre-licensure nursing market, capacity limitations and restricted new student enrollment are common among traditional four-year educational institutions and community colleges. Chamberlain has 23 campuses located in 15 states. In Fall 2022, according to data obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing AACN ), Chamberlain had the largest pre-licensure program in the U.S based on total enrollments. In post-licensure nursing education, there are more than 700 institutions offering RN-to-BSN programs and more than 600 institutions offering MSN programs. Chamberlain s RN-to-BSN degree completion option has received three certifications from Quality Matters, an independent global organization leading quality assurance in online teaching and learning environments. Chamberlain has earned the Online Learning Support, Online Teaching Support, and Online Learner Success certifications. Chamberlain s RN-to-BSN degree completion option, MSN degree program, and DNP degree program are approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MSN FNP track is approved in 47 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the AGACNP and AGPCNP tracks are approved in 44 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the PMHNP track is approved in 43 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MPH and MSW programs are approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

 In Fall 2022, according to AACN data, Chamberlain had the largest DNP, MSN, and FNP programs in the U.S based on total enrollments. Walden The market for fully online higher education, in which Walden competes, remains a highly competitive and growing space. As a comprehensive university offering degrees at the bachelor s, master s and doctoral level, in addition to certificates and a school of lifelong learning, the competition varies depending on the degree level and the discipline. While Walden s target market of working professionals 25 years and older was once underserved, it now has a variety of options to meet the growing need for higher education. Walden has degree programs in nursing, education, counseling, business, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice. Walden competes both with other comprehensive universities and also more narrowly focused schools, which may only offer a few degree programs. Given the growing and ever-changing market, Walden competes with a wide variety of higher education institutions as well as other education providers. Walden competes with traditional public and private non-profit institutions and for-profit schools. As more campus-based institutions offer online programs, the competition for online higher education has been growing. Typically, public universities charge lower tuitions compared with Walden due to state subsidies, government grants, and access to other financial resources. On the other hand, tuition at private non-profit institutions is higher than the average tuition rates at Walden. Walden competes with other educational institutions principally based on price, quality of education, reputation, learning modality, educational programs, and student services. Walden has over 50 years of experience offering high quality distance education with a mission to provide access to higher education for working professionals. Walden remains a leader in many areas and is one of the leading doctoral degree conferrers in nursing, public health, public policy, business/management, education, and psychology and one of the leading conferrers of master s degrees in nursing, psychology, social work, human services, education, and counseling. Medical and Veterinary AUC and RUSM compete with approximately 150 U.S. schools of medicine, 48 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, and more than 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from ED Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with AVMA accredited schools, of which 33 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 16 are other international veterinary schools. There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors and veterinarians. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical and veterinary education. Accreditation and Other Regulatory Approvals Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance and institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accreditation status of an institution when evaluating a candidate s credentials; parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards; and many professions require candidates to graduate from an accredited program in order to obtain professional licensure in their respective fields. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.

RUSVM has received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher Nevis Accreditation Board. The Postgraduate Studies program offers Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM s themed research centers. Regulatory Environment Financial Aid All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the HEA guides the federal government s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008 and was signed into law in August 2008. In the 118 th Congress, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill has not been introduced. However, standalone bills impacting Title IV federal financial aid programs have been introduced in both chambers of Congress. Some of these bills could be included in a larger legislative package, which could include the HEA. When the HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions. Information about Particular U.S. and Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below. U.S. Federal Financial Aid Programs Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA. 1. Grants. Chamberlain and Walden undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs. Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2022-2023 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from 700 to 6,895. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant FSEOG ): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed 4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25 matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below), or by externally provided scholarship grants. 
 2. Loans. Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students may participate in the Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Chamberlain and Walden undergraduate students may also be eligible for Subsidized Loans within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time

Table of Contents 
 basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). Loan limits per academic year range from 3,500 for students in their first academic year, 4,500 for their second academic year, to 5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year. Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Awarded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits vary based on dependency status and level of study, with 2,000 for undergraduate dependent students per academic year. Independent undergraduate students may borrow 6,000 in their first and second academic years, increasing to 7,000 in later undergraduate years. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits then increase to 20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is 57,500 and 138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate. Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans : Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance, which includes allowances for tuition, fees, and living expenses. Both Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements. 
 3. Federal Work-study. Chamberlain participates in this program, which offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds. State Financial Aid Programs Certain states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Vermont, offer state grants or loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending Adtalem institutions. Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet, or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Canadian students attending Walden or Chamberlain online while in the U.S., or attending AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM, may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions, and interest relief on loans. Information about Other Financial Aid Programs Private Loan Programs Some Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs borrowed from private lenders for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student s cost of attendance and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student s enrollment and unmet need. 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 Most private loans are approved on the basis of the student s and/or a co-borrower s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more expensive than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the federal financial aid process. Student finance personnel at Adtalem s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans. With the exception of Chamberlain, Adtalem s institutions do not maintain preferred lender lists. However, all students are entirely free to utilize a lender of their choice. Tax-Favored Programs The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored 529 college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits, and tax deductions for interest on student loans. Adtalem-Provided Financial Assistance Each of our institutions offers a variety of scholarships to assist with tuition and fee expenses, some of which are one-time awards while others are renewable. Some students may also qualify for more than one scholarship at a time. Chamberlain students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships with awards up to 2,500 per semester. Walden offers a number of different scholarships discounts and other tuition assistance to eligible students. These vary by program and by term but usually consist of any of the following: 500- 1,000 grants per term over three to ten terms; scholarships specific to the company they work for; if they are an alumnus of Walden; or if they are in the military. Walden also offers a Believe Achieve scholarship that rewards undergraduate and Masters students free tuition upon completion of an agreed number of terms, depending on the program, modality of student, and credits earned. These range in value from 1,500- 14,985. Students at AUC may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from 5,000 to 80,000 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSM may be eligible for various institutional scholarships, ranging from 3,000 to 100,000, to cover expenses incurred from housing, tuition and fees. Students at RUSVM may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from 2,000 to 22,683 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Adtalem s credit extension programs are available to students at Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. These credit extension programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, books, and fees, and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM allow students to finance their living expenses. Repayment plans for financing agreements are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges at rates from 3.0 to 12.0 per annum accrue each month on the unpaid balance once a student withdraws or graduates from a program. Most students are required to begin repaying their loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay, which reduces the possibility of over borrowing. Payments may increase upon completing or departing school. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan. The finance agreements do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest, and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the financing agreements and counseled to utilize all other available private and federal funding options before securing financing through the institution. Adtalem financing agreements are carried on our balance sheet, net of related reserves, and there are no relationships with external parties that reduce Adtalem s risk of collections.

 Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance Chamberlain and Walden students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session. Walden students eligible for tuition reimbursement must make payment arrangements with Walden and then be reimbursed by their employer. When the employer pays on behalf of the employee, Walden will bill the employer and payment terms are due 20 days from the receipt of the billing statement. Legislative and Regulatory Requirements Government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding. U.S. Federal Regulations Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following: (1) the federal government through ED, (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by ED, and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies. To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable. In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been increased focus by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ), and the Federal Trade Commission FTC ), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future. Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV participating institutions Title IV Institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement PPA as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV Institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem s Title IV Institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV Institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV Institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs under subsection Risks Related to Adtalem s Highly Regulated Industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have summarized the most significant current regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. Adtalem has been impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and is currently facing multiple related lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on Adtalem, see in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: (1) Note 21 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

 Risks Related to Adtalem s Highly Regulated Industry, and (3) the subsection of Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations titled Regulatory Environment. Eligibility and Certification Procedures The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Institutions that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are typically required to be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10 of the Title IV aid it received in the institution s most recent fiscal year). Provisional certification status also carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution. ED has published proposed rules to amend the certification procedures. We anticipate the amended rules will be effective on July 1, 2024. Defense to Repayment Regulations Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a Defense to Repayment of a Direct Loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. On July 1, 2023, new Defense to Repayment regulations went into effect that include a lower threshold for establishing misrepresentation, provides for no statute of limitation for claims submission, expands reasons to file a claim including aggressive or deceptive recruitment tactics and omission of fact, weakens due processes afforded to institutions, and reinstates provisions for group discharges. ED also included a six-year statute of limitations for recovery from institutions. These changes may increase financial liability and reputational risk. The 90/10 Rule An ED regulation known as the 90/10 Rule affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90 of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the Rescue Act enacted on March 11, 2021 amended the 90/10 rule to require that a proprietary institution derive no more than 90 of its revenue from federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. This change was subject to negotiated rulemaking, which ended in March 2022. The amended rule applies to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs as calculated under the current regulations (excluding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Final data for fiscal year 2023 is not yet available. As institution s 90/10 compliance must be calculated using the financial results of an entire fiscal year, we are including Walden s amounts for the full fiscal year 2022 in the table below, including the portion of the year not under Adtalem s ownership.

 Incentive Compensation An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement have not established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. New rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increased the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes have limited and are expected to continue to limit Adtalem s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that Adtalem has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment, admissions, or awarding of Title IV program funds. Standards of Financial Responsibility An ED defined financial responsibility test is required for continued participation by an institution in Title IV aid programs. For Adtalem s institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. Applying various financial elements from the fiscal year audited financial statements, the test is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible but require additional oversight. These institutions are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, an institution with a score of less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10 of the Title IV aid it received in the institution s most recent fiscal year). For the past several years, Adtalem s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. As a result of the acquisition of Walden, Adtalem expects ED will conclude its consolidated fiscal year 2022 composite score will fall below 1.5. As a result, ED may impose certain additional conditions for continued access to federal funding including heightened cash monitoring and/or an additional letter of credit. Management does not believe such conditions, if any, will have a material adverse effect on Adtalem s operations. ED also has proposed rules to amend the financial responsibility regulations. We anticipate any rules will be effective on July 1, 2024. Administrative Capability The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny its eligibility for Title IV programs. ED has proposed rules to amend the administrative capability regulations. We anticipate any amended rules will be effective on July 1, 2024. State Authorization Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain is specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain has obtained licensure in states which require such licensure

 and where their students are enrolled and is an institutional participant in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements NC-SARA initiative. Walden does not participate in NC-SARA, and therefore maintains licenses or exemptions in those states that require it to do so to enroll students in distance education programs where they are currently offered. On December 19, 2016, ED published new rules concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. These regulations, which would have become effective beginning July 1, 2018, but were delayed until July 1, 2020, were subsequently renegotiated as part of the 2018-2019 Accreditation and Innovation rule-making sessions. The renegotiated rule went into effect on July 1, 2020 and requires an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state from which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The regulations also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. Lastly, the regulations require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that lead to professional licensure. ED has proposed to amend the rules to require that a program meet state licensure requirements in lieu of the aforementioned disclosures. The earliest any amended rules will be effective is July 1, 2024. Cohort Default Rates ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges, many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled compared to four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities. Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the cohort defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20 for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution s operations and its students ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30 or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30 for three consecutive years are also ineligible for Federal Pell Grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40 or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs. According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid was 2.3 for the fiscal year 2019 cohort (the latest available) and 7.3 for the fiscal year 2018 cohort. Default rates for Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students are as follows: 

Cohort Default Rate 2019 2018 Chamberlain University 0.5 2.6 Walden University 1.1 4.7 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine 0.2 0.7 Ross University School of Medicine 0.2 0.9 Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine 0.2 0.4

 Satisfactory Academic Progress In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average. Change of Ownership or Control Any material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV Institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution s accreditors, reauthorization by each institutions state licensing agencies, and/or providing financial protections. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV Institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained. After a material change in ownership or change of control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years. In addition, each Title IV Institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review. In addition, some states in which our Title IV Institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control. Refer to the risk factor titled If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions accreditation and our institutions state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business under subsection Risks Related to Adtalem s Highly Regulated Industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Gainful Employment Current law states that proprietary institutions and non-degree programs at private non-profit and public institutions must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. ED has published proposed rules to define and implement this existing law through what is referred to as the Gainful Employment GE rules. A prior version of this rule was rescinded on July 1, 2019. ED is proposing to use debt-to-earnings ratios and an earnings threshold in determining whether graduates were gainfully employed. Repeated failure of a program to meet these measures would result in the program losing Title IV eligibility. We anticipate the new rules will be effective on July 1, 2024. State Approvals and Licensing Adtalem institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities to recruit students, operate schools, and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain location is approved to grant degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Walden is registered in its home state of Minnesota with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required. Many states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted 31.9 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM.

 Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If Adtalem were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, Adtalem could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, Adtalem has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required. Seasonality The seasonal pattern of Adtalem s enrollments and its educational programs starting dates affect the timing of cash flows with higher cash inflows at the beginning of academic sessions. Human Capital As of June 30, 2023, Adtalem had the following number of employees: 

Full-Time Visiting Part-Time Staff Professors Staff Total Chamberlain 1,274 2,587 215 4,076 Walden 1,097 2,342 15 3,454 Medical and Veterinary 750 64 44 858 Home Office 1,247 20 1,267 Total 4,368 4,993 294 9,655 Our management believes that Adtalem has good relations with its employees. We continue to regularly gather feedback from our employees. In the prior year we disclosed results from our summer 2022 engagement survey. We expect to conduct our next engagement survey during fiscal year 2024. We also gather employee feedback through the colleague lifecycle survey we call continuous listening. The lifecycle survey gathers feedback week one (preboarding), at three months (quality of hire), and at six months (onboarding) for regular new hires. We also send out an exit survey to regular colleagues that voluntarily resign. The overall experience results of these surveys are as follows: 

Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 Favorability Favorability Survey (top 2 ratings) (top 2 ratings) Preboarding (week one) 92 89 Quality of hire (3 months) 75 68 Onboarding (6 months) 86 85 Exit survey 56 45 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion DEI continue to be core tenets of our culture at Adtalem. During fiscal year 2023, we hired a vice president of DEI and talent management. We continuously measure representation amongst our employee population. As shown in the table below, our total female representation dropped from 75 as of June 30, 2022 to 71 as of June 30, 2023, driven by turnover during fiscal year 2023 being 78 female, while hiring was only 75 female.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Summary of Risk Factors The summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities: Risks Related to Adtalem s Highly Regulated Industry We are subject to regulatory audits, investigations, lawsuits, or other proceedings relating to compliance by the institutions in the Adtalem portfolio with numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions applicable to the postsecondary education industry. The ongoing regulatory effort aimed at proprietary postsecondary institutions of higher education could be a catalyst for additional legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions, and claims. Adverse publicity arising from investigations, claims, or actions brought against us or other proprietary higher education institutions may negatively affect our reputation, business, or stock price, or attract additional investigations, lawsuits, or regulatory action. Government and regulatory agencies and third parties have initiated, and could initiate additional investigations, claims, or actions against us, which could require us to pay monetary damages, halt certain business practices, or receive other sanctions. The defense and resolution of these matters could require us to expend significant resources. The U.S. Department of Education ED has issued regulations setting forth new standards and procedures related to borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loan obligations, and ED s right of recoveries against institutions following a successful borrower defense and institutional financial responsibility. It is possible that a finding or allegation arising from current or future legal proceedings or governmental administrative actions may create significant liability under the proposed regulations. Within Title IV regulations, pending or future lawsuits, investigations, program reviews, and other events could each trigger, automatically or in some cases at ED s discretion, the posting of letters of credit or other securities. We are subject to risks relating to regulatory matters. If we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our operations, we could face fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal and state student financial aid for our students, loss of ability to enroll students in a state, and significant civil liability. Government budgetary pressures and changes to laws governing financial aid programs could reduce our student enrollment or delay our receipt of tuition payments. Our ability to comply with some ED regulations is affected by economic forces affecting our students and graduates that are not entirely within our control. ED rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentation are very broad. As a result, we face increased exposure to litigation arising from student and prospective student complaints and enforcement actions by ED that could restrict or eliminate our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Regulations governing the eligibility of our U.S. degree-granting institutions to participate in Title IV programs preclude us from compensating any employee or third-party involved in student recruitment, admissions, or the awarding of financial aid based on their success in those areas. These regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain highly-qualified employees, to sustain and grow our business, or to develop or acquire businesses that would not otherwise be subject to such regulations. A failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If ED does not recertify any one of our institutions to continue participating in Title IV programs, students at that institution would lose their access to Title IV program funds. Alternatively, ED could recertify our institutions but require our institutions to accept significant limitations as a condition of their continued participation in Title IV programs. If we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by ED, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs. A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV Institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV Institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Excessive student loan defaults could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs in that state.

 Our ability to place our medical schools students in hospitals in the U.S. may be limited by efforts of certain state government regulatory bodies, which may limit the growth potential of our medical schools, put our medical schools at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, or force our medical schools to substantially reduce their class sizes. Budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our enrollment and adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage. We could be subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program. A failure of our vendors to comply with applicable regulations in the servicing of our students and institutions could subject us to fines or restrictions on or loss of our ability to participate in Title IV programs. We provide financing programs to assist some of our students in affording our educational offerings. These programs are subject to various federal and state rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans, and other injunctive requirements. Release of confidential information could subject us to civil penalties or cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. We could be subject to sanctions if we fail to accurately and timely report sponsored students tuition, fees, and enrollment to the sponsoring agency. Risks Related to Adtalem s Business Outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health pandemics in the locations in which we, our students, faculty, and employees live, work, and attend classes, could substantially harm our business. Natural disasters or other extraordinary events or political disruptions may cause us to close some of our schools. Student enrollment at our schools is affected by legislative, regulatory, and economic factors that may change in ways we cannot predict. These factors outside our control limit our ability to assess our future enrollment effectively. We are subject to risks relating to enrollment of students. If we are not able to continue to successfully recruit and retain our students, our revenue may decline. If our graduates are unable to find appropriate employment opportunities or obtain professional licensure or certification, we may not be able to recruit new students. We face heightened competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions. The personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations. System disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our computer network or information systems could severely impact our ability to serve our existing students and attract new students. Our ability to open new campuses, offer new programs, and add capacity is dependent on regulatory approvals and requires financial and human resources. We may not be able to attract, retain, and develop key employees necessary for our operations and the successful execution of our strategic plans. We may not be able to successfully identify, pursue, or integrate acquisitions. Proposed changes in, or lapses of, U.S. tax laws regarding earnings from international operations could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results. We and our subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our debt obligations. Risks Related to Shareholder Activism We may face risks associated with shareholder activism. 
 Adtalem s business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are not entirely within our control. Investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision with respect to Adtalem s common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, Adtalem s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, and as a result, the price of Adtalem s common stock could be materially and adversely

 affected. Management cannot predict all the possible risks and uncertainties that may arise. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Adtalem s business include the following: Risks Related to Adtalem s Highly Regulated Industry We are subject to regulatory audits, investigations, lawsuits, or other proceedings relating to compliance by the institutions in the Adtalem portfolio with numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions applicable to the postsecondary education industry. Due to the highly regulated nature of proprietary postsecondary institutions, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of non-compliance, and lawsuits by federal and state governmental agencies, regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, present and former students and employees, shareholders, and other third parties, any of whom may allege violations of any of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us. If the results of any such claims or actions are unfavorable to us or one or more of our institutions, we may be required to pay monetary judgments, fines, or penalties, be required to repay funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have restrictions placed on or terminate our schools or programs eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or state financial aid programs, have limitations placed on or terminate our schools operations or ability to grant degrees and certificates, have our schools accreditations restricted or revoked, or be subject to civil or criminal penalties. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV Institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its Program Participation Agreement PPA as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV Institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem s Title IV Institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability for Adtalem s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. The ongoing regulatory effort aimed at proprietary postsecondary institutions of higher education could be a catalyst for additional legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions, and claims. The proprietary postsecondary education sector has at times experienced scrutiny from federal legislators, agencies, and state legislators and attorneys general. An adverse disposition of these existing inquiries, administrative actions, or claims, or the initiation of other inquiries, administrative actions, or claims, could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations, and cash flows and result in significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. ED has proposed new Gainful Employment GE rules that would condition Title IV eligibility for each program at Adtalem s institutions on passing debt to earnings ratio thresholds. These ratios would be based on the debt incurred by graduates and their post-graduate earnings. A program would lose eligibility if it failed in any two of three consecutive years that it was measured. Warnings must be issued to students and prospective students if a program may lose eligibility in the following GE year (e.g., if it failed in the first year). Adtalem s Title IV Institutions could be adversely impacted by the rule. Adverse publicity arising from investigations, claims, or actions brought against us or other proprietary higher education institutions may negatively affect our reputation, business, or stock price, or attract additional investigations, lawsuits, or regulatory action. Adverse publicity regarding any past, pending, or future investigations, claims, settlements, and/or actions against us or other proprietary postsecondary education institutions could negatively affect our reputation, student enrollment levels, revenue, profit, and/or the market price of our common stock. Unresolved investigations, claims, and actions, or adverse resolutions or settlements thereof, could also result in additional inquiries, administrative actions or lawsuits, increased scrutiny, the withholding of authorizations, and/or the imposition of other sanctions by state education and professional licensing authorities, taxing authorities, our accreditors and other regulatory agencies governing us, which, individually or

 in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Government and regulatory agencies and third parties have initiated, and could initiate additional investigations, claims, or actions against us, which could require us to pay monetary damages, halt certain business practices, or receive other sanctions. The defense and resolution of these matters could require us to expend significant resources. Due to the regulatory and enforcement efforts at times directed at proprietary postsecondary higher education institutions and adverse publicity arising from such efforts, we may face additional government and regulatory investigations and actions, lawsuits from private plaintiffs, and shareholder class actions and derivative claims. We may incur significant costs and other expenses in connection with our response to, and defense, resolution, or settlement of, investigations, claims, or actions, or group of related investigations, claims, or actions, which, individually or in the aggregate, could be outside the scope of, or in excess of, our existing insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. As part of our resolution of any such matter, or group of related matters, we may be required to comply with certain forms of injunctive relief, including altering certain business practices, or pay substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and/or penalties. In addition, findings or claims or settlements thereof could serve as a basis for additional lawsuits or governmental inquiries or enforcement actions, including actions under ED s Defense to Repayment regulations. Such actions, individually or combined with other proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain, or renew licenses, approvals, or accreditation, and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV, Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us under Defense to Repayment regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. ED has issued regulations setting forth new standards and procedures related to borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loan obligations, and ED s right of recoveries against institutions following a successful borrower defense and institutional financial responsibility. It is possible that a finding or allegation arising from current or future legal proceedings or governmental administrative actions may create significant liability under the proposed regulations. Under the Higher Education Act HEA ), ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a Defense to Repayment of a Direct Loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. On July 1, 2023, new Defense to Repayment regulations went into effect that include a lower threshold for establishing misrepresentation, expands acts which lead to an approved claim, removes a statute of limitation for claims submission, implements a single federal standard regardless of when the loan was first disbursed, and reinstates provisions for group discharges. ED also included a six-year statute of limitations for recovery from institutions. These changes may increase financial liability and reputational risk. The outcome of any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority, facts asserted in pending or future lawsuits, and/or the outcome of any future governmental inquiry, lawsuit, or enforcement action (including matters described in Note 21 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data could serve as the basis for claims by students or ED under the Defense to Repayment regulations, the posting of substantial letters of credit, or the termination of eligibility of our institutions to participate in the Title IV program based on ED s institutional capability assessment, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.

 While we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in all pending and future legal proceedings, we may settle certain matters. Moreover, regardless of the merits of our actions and defenses, if we are unable to resolve certain legal proceedings or regulatory actions, indirect consequences arising from unproven allegations or appealable regulatory findings may have adverse consequences to us. We may settle certain matters due to uncertainty in potential outcome, for strategic reasons, as a part of a resolution of other matters, or in order to avoid potentially worse consequences in inherently uncertain judicial or administrative processes. The terms of any such settlement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, and cash flows, and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, although inconsistent with its usual practices, ED has broad discretion to impose significant limitations on us and our business operations arising from acts it determines are in violation of their regulations. As a result, foreseeable and unforeseeable consequences of prior and prospective adjudicated or settled legal proceedings and regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Within Title IV regulations, pending or future lawsuits, investigations, program reviews, and other events could each trigger, automatically or in some cases at ED s discretion, the posting of letters of credit or other securities. ED regulations could require Adtalem to post multiple and substantial letters of credit or other securities in connection with, among other things, certain pending and future claims, investigations, and program reviews, regardless of the merits of our actions or available defenses, or, potentially, the severity of any findings or facts stipulated. The aggregate amount of these letters of credit or other required security could materially and adversely limit our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and our ability to make capital expenditures and other investments aimed at growing and diversifying our operations, sustain and fund our operations, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Adtalem s credit agreement allows Adtalem to post up to 400.0 million in letters of credit. In the event Adtalem is required to post letters of credit in excess of the 400.0 million limit, Adtalem would be required to seek an amendment to its credit agreement or seek an alternative means of providing security required by ED. Adtalem may not be able to obtain the excess letters of credit or security or may only be able to obtain such excess letters of credit or security at significant cost. We are subject to risks relating to regulatory matters. If we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our operations, we could face fines and penalties, including loss of access to federal and state student financial aid for our students, loss of ability to enroll students in a state, and significant civil liability. As a provider of higher education, we are subject to extensive regulation. These regulatory requirements cover virtually all phases and aspects of our U.S. postsecondary operations, including educational program offerings, facilities, civil rights, safety, public health, privacy, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, acquisitions or openings of new schools or programs, addition of new educational programs, and changes in our corporate structure and ownership. In particular, in the U.S., the HEA subjects schools that participate in the various federal student financial aid programs under Title IV, which includes Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM, to significant regulatory scrutiny. Adtalem s Title IV Institutions collectively receive 72 of their revenue from Title IV programs. As a result, the suspension, limitation, or termination of the eligibility of any of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. To participate in Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution, which ultimately is accomplished through the execution of a PPA. Our institutions that participate in Title IV programs each do so pursuant to a PPA that, among other things, includes commitments to abide by all applicable laws and regulations, such as Incentive Compensation and Substantial Misrepresentation. Alleged violations of such laws or regulations may form the basis of civil actions for violation of state and/or federal false claims statutes predicated on violations of a PPA, including pursuant to lawsuits brought by private

 plaintiffs on behalf of governments (qui tam actions), that have the potential to generate very significant damages linked to our receipt of Title IV funding from the government over a period of several years. Government budgetary pressures and changes to laws governing financial aid programs could reduce our student enrollment or delay our receipt of tuition payments. Our Title IV Institutions collectively receive 72 of their revenue from Title IV programs. As a result, any reductions in funds available to our students or any delays in payments to us under Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Action by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for those programs could reduce Adtalem s student enrollment and/or increase its costs of operation. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV programs. The U.S. Congress enacted the HEA to be reauthorized on a periodic basis, which most recently occurred in August 2008. The 2008 reauthorization of the HEA made significant changes to the requirements governing Title IV programs, including changes that, among other things: Regulated non-federal, private education loans; Regulated the relationship between institutions and lenders that make education loans; Revised the calculation of the student default rate attributed to an institution and the threshold rate at which sanctions will be imposed against an institution (as discussed above); Adjusted the types of revenue that an institution is deemed to have derived from Title IV programs and the sanctions imposed on an institution that derives too much revenue from Title IV programs; Increased the types and amount of information that an institution must disclose to current and prospective students and the public; and Increased the types of policies and practices that an institution must adopt and follow. 
 In the 118 th Congress, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill has not been introduced. However, standalone bills impacting Title IV federal financial aid programs have been introduced in both chambers of Congress. Some of these bills could be included in a larger legislative package, which could include the HEA. When the HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions. The U.S. Congress can change the laws affecting Title IV programs in annual federal appropriations bills and other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations. At this time, Adtalem cannot predict any or all of the changes that the U.S. Congress may ultimately make. Since a significant percentage of Adtalem s revenue is tied to Title IV programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of Adtalem s degree-granting institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on Adtalem s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Certain provisions in proposed legislation, if enacted, or implementation of existing or future law by a current or future administration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including but not limited to legislation that limits the enrollment of U.S. citizens in foreign medical schools and legislation that could require institutions to share in the risk of defaulted federal student loans, and legislation that limits the percentage of revenue derived from federal funds. Additionally, a shutdown of government agencies, such as ED, responsible for administering student financial aid programs under Title IV could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and disbursement of government-funded student loans to our students. Our ability to comply with some ED regulations is affected by economic forces affecting our students and graduates that are not entirely within our control. Our ability to comply with several ED regulations is not entirely within our control. In particular, our ability to participate in federal Title IV programs is dependent on the ability of our past students to avoid default on student loans, obtain employment, and pay for a portion of their education with private funds. These factors are heavily influenced by 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 broader economic drivers, including the personal or family wealth of our students, the overall employment outlook for their area of study, and the availability of private financing sources. An economic downturn could impact these factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. ED rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentation are very broad. As a result, we face increased exposure to litigation arising from student and prospective student complaints and enforcement actions by ED that could restrict or eliminate our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. ED regulations in effect for federal Stafford loans prohibit any substantial misrepresentation by our Title IV Institutions, employees, and agents regarding the nature of the institution s educational programs, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. These regulations may, among other things, subject us to sanctions for statements containing errors made to non-students, including any member of the public, impose liability on us for the conduct of others and expose us to liability even when no actual harm occurs. A substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person s detriment. It is possible that despite our efforts to prevent misrepresentations, our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. As a result, we may face complaints from students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents in advertising and marketing, during the enrollment, admissions and financial aid process, and throughout attendance at any of our Title IV Institutions, which would expose us to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties, including potential Defense to Repayment liabilities, and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. If ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may (1) fine the institution; (2) discharge students debt and hold the institution liable for the discharged debt under the HEA and the Defense to Repayment regulations; and/or (3) suspend or terminate an institution s participation in Title IV programs. Alternatively, ED may impose certain other limitations on the institution s participation in Title IV programs, which could include the denial of applications for approval of new programs or locations, a requirement to post a substantial letter of credit, or the imposition of one of ED s heightened cash monitoring processes. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Regulations governing the eligibility of our U.S. degree-granting institutions to participate in Title IV programs preclude us from compensating any employee or third-party involved in student recruitment, admissions, or the awarding of financial aid based on their success in those areas. These regulations could limit our ability to attract and retain highly-qualified employees, to sustain and grow our business, or to develop or acquire businesses that would not otherwise be subject to such regulations. An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. We endeavor to ensure our compliance with these regulations and have numerous controls and procedures in place to do so but cannot be sure that our regulators will not determine that the compensation that we have paid our employees do not violate these regulations. Our limited ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. These regulations may also impair our ability to sustain and grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. A failure to demonstrate financial responsibility or administrative capability may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. All of our Title IV Institutions are subject to meeting financial and administrative standards. These standards are assessed through annual compliance audits, periodic renewal of institutional PPAs, periodic program reviews, and ad hoc events which may lead ED to evaluate an institution s financial responsibility or administrative capability. The administrative capability criteria require, among other things, that our institutions (1) have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs, (2) have adequate procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining records, (3) submit all required reports and consolidated financial statements in a timely manner, and 
 29

 (4) not have significant problems that affect the institution s ability to administer Title IV programs. If ED determines, in its judgment, that one of our Title IV Institutions has failed to demonstrate either financial responsibility or administrative capability, we could be subject to additional conditions to participating, including, among other things, a requirement to post a letter of credit, suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or repayment of funds received under Title IV programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. ED has considerable discretion under the regulations to impose the foregoing sanctions and, in some cases, such sanctions could be imposed without advance notice or any prior right of review or appeal. Adtalem expects its consolidated fiscal year 2022 composite score to fall below 1.5 at its next financial responsibility test. If Adtalem becomes unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards within the regulations, management believes it will be able to otherwise demonstrate its ability to continue to provide educational services; however, our institutions could still be subject to heightened cash monitoring and/or be required to post a letter of credit to continue to participate in federal and state financial assistance programs. ED has proposed changes to the financial responsibility and administrative capability rules. The earliest any amended rules will be effective is July 1, 2024. If ED does not recertify any one of our institutions to continue participating in Title IV programs, students at that institution would lose their access to Title IV program funds. Alternatively, ED could recertify our institutions but require our institutions to accept significant limitations as a condition of their continued participation in Title IV programs. ED certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are thus required to seek recertification from ED on a regular basis in order to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by ED if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by ED regulations. Each of our Title IV Institutions operates under a PPA. There can be no assurance that ED will recertify an institution after its PPA expires or that ED will not limit the period of recertification to participate in Title IV programs to less than six years, place the institution on provisional certification, or impose conditions or other restrictions on the institution as a condition of granting our application for recertification. If ED does not renew or withdraws the certification to participate in Title IV programs for one or more of our institutions at any time, students at such institution would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Alternatively, ED could (1) renew the certifications for an institution, but restrict or delay receipt of Title IV funds, limit the number of students to whom an institution could disburse such funds, or place other restrictions on that institution, or (2) delay recertification after an institution s PPA expires, in which case the institution s certification would continue on a month-to-month basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the institution or Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of the institution or Adtalem as a whole to operate. Chamberlain was most recently recertified and issued an unrestricted PPA in September 2020, with an expiration date of March 31, 2024. Walden was issued a Temporary Provisional PPA TPPPA in connection with their acquisition by Adtalem on September 17, 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, ED provisionally recertified AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM s Title IV PPAs with expiration dates of December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The lengthy PPA recertification process is such that ED allows unhampered continued access to Title IV funding after PPA expiration, so long as materially complete applications are submitted at least 90 days in advance of expiration. Complete applications for PPA recertification have been timely submitted to ED. The provisional nature of the agreements for AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM stemmed from increased and/or repeated Title IV compliance audit findings. Walden s TPPPA included financial requirements, which were in place prior to acquisition, such as a letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring, and additional reporting. No similar requirements were imposed on AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM. While corrective actions have been taken to resolve past compliance matters and eliminate the incidence of repetition, if AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM fail to maintain administrative capability as defined by ED while under provisional status or otherwise fail to comply with ED requirements, the institution(s) could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. ED has proposed changes to the certification rules. The earliest any amended rules will be effective is July 1, 2024.

 If we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation or if our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by ED, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs. The loss of institutional accreditation by any of our Title IV Institutions would leave the affected institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. In addition, an adverse action by any of our institutional accreditors other than loss of accreditation, such as issuance of a warning, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased scrutiny of accreditors by the Secretary of Education in connection with ED s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accreditors or have other consequences. If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions accreditations and our institutions state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business. Any material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV Institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution s accreditors, reauthorization by each institutions state licensing agencies, and/or providing financial protections. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV Institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. The continuing participation of each of our Title IV Institutions in Title IV programs is critical to our business. Any disruption in an institution s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. In addition, each Title IV Institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review. If our accreditors determine that the change is such that prior approval was required, but was not obtained, many of our accreditors policies require the accreditor to consider withdrawal of accreditation. If certain accreditation is suspended or withdrawn with respect to any of our Title IV Institutions, they would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until the accreditation is reinstated or is obtained from another appropriate accrediting body. There is no assurance that reinstatement of accreditation could be obtained on a timely basis, if at all, and accreditation from a different qualified accrediting authority, if available, would require a significant amount of time. Any material disruption in accreditation would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. In addition, some states in which our Title IV Institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control. As of June 30, 2023, a substantial portion of our outstanding capital stock is owned by a small group of institutional shareholders. We cannot prevent a material change of ownership or change of control that could arise from a transfer of voting stock by any combination of those shareholders. A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV Institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV Institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In the event of a bankruptcy filing by Adtalem, all of our Title IV Institutions would lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, pursuant to statutory provisions of the HEA, notwithstanding the automatic stay provisions of federal bankruptcy law, which would make any reorganization difficult to implement. Similarly, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by any of Adtalem s subsidiaries that own a Title IV Institution, such institution would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In the event of any bankruptcy affecting one or more of our Title IV Institutions, ED 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 could hold our other Title IV Institutions jointly liable for any Title IV program liabilities, whether asserted or unasserted at the time of such bankruptcy, of the institution whose Title IV program eligibility was terminated. Further, in the event that an institution closes and fails to pay liabilities or other amounts owed to ED, ED can attribute the liabilities of that institution to other institutions under common ownership. If any one of our Title IV Institutions were to close or have unpaid ED liabilities, ED could seek to have those liabilities repaid by one of our other Title IV Institutions. Excessive student loan defaults could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Our Title IV Institutions may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are greater than standards set by ED. An educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, if, for three consecutive federal fiscal years, 30 or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next two federal fiscal years. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if its default rate for a federal fiscal year was greater than 40 . If any of our Title IV Institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. The latest three-year default rates are for the federal fiscal year 2019 cohort entering repayment. Default rates for the fiscal year 2019 cohort for Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM are 0.5 , 1.1 , 0.2 , 0.2 , and 0.2 , respectively. Our Title IV Institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs were too high. Our Title IV Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, on a cash basis, the percentage of the institution s revenue derived from Title IV programs for two consecutive fiscal years is greater than 90 (the 90/10 Rule ). Further, if an institution exceeds the 90 threshold for any single fiscal year, ED could place that institution on provisional certification status for the institution s following two fiscal years. In October 2022, ED published new 90/10 rules effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The most significant change is the inclusion of all federal funds in the numerator, not just Title IV funds. If any of our Title IV Institutions lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because they are unable to comply with ED s 90/10 Rule, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Our failure to comply with ED s credit hour rule could result in sanctions and other liability. In 2009 and 2010, ED s Office of Inspector General criticized three accreditors, including the Higher Learning Commission HLC ), which is the accreditor for Chamberlain and Walden, for deficiency in their oversight of institutions credit hour allocations. In June 2010, the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing concerning accrediting agencies standards for assessing institutions credit hour policies. The 2010 Program Integrity Regulations defined the term credit hour for the first time and required accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor does not comply with this requirement, its recognition by ED could be jeopardized. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If ED determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, ED could impose liabilities or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. If we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs in that state. Our Title IV Institutions must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution is located. Campuses of our Title IV Institutions are authorized to operate and grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates by the applicable education agency of the state in which each such campus is located. Many states are currently reevaluating and revising their authorization regulations, especially as applied to distance education. The loss 
 32 

Table of Contents 
 of state authorization would, among other things, render the affected institution ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, at least at those state campus locations, and otherwise limit that school s ability to operate in that state. Loss of authorization in one or more states could increase the likelihood of additional scrutiny and potential loss of operating and/or degree-granting authority in other states in which we operate, which would further impact our business. If these pressures and uncertainty continue in the future, or if one or more of our institutions are unable to offer programs in one or more states, it could have a material adverse impact on our enrollment, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Our ability to place our medical schools students in hospitals in the U.S. may be limited by efforts of certain state government regulatory bodies, which may limit the growth potential of our medical schools, put our medical schools at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, or force our medical schools to substantially reduce their class sizes. AUC and RUSM enter into affiliation agreements with hospitals across the U.S. to place their third and fourth year students in clinical programs at such hospitals. Certain states with regulatory programs that require state approval of clinical education programs have in recent years precluded, limited, or imposed onerous requirements on Adtalem s entry into affiliation agreements with hospitals in their states. If these or other states continue to limit access to affiliation arrangements, our medical schools may be at a competitive disadvantage to other medical schools, and our medical schools may be required to substantially restrict their enrollment due to limited clinical opportunities for enrolled students. The impact on enrollment, and the potential for enrollment growth, of such restrictions on our medical schools clinical placements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Budget constraints in states that provide state financial aid to our students could reduce the amount of such financial aid that is available to our students, which could reduce our enrollment and adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage . Some states are experiencing budget deficits and constraints. Some of these states have reduced or eliminated various student financial assistance programs or established minimum performance measures as a condition of participation, and additional states may do so in the future. If our students who receive this type of assistance cannot secure alternate sources of funding, they may be forced to withdraw, reduce the rate at which they seek to complete their education, or replace the source with more expensive forms of funding, such as private loans. Other students who would otherwise have been eligible for state financial assistance may not be able to enroll without such aid. This reduced funding could decrease our enrollment and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the reduction or elimination of these non-Title IV sources of student funding may adversely affect our 90/10 Rule percentage. We could be subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate accurately and make timely payment of refunds of Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program. The HEA and ED regulations require us to calculate refunds of unearned Title IV program funds disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational program. If refunds are not properly calculated or timely paid, we may be required to post a letter of credit with ED or be subject to sanctions or other adverse actions by ED, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. A failure of our vendors to comply with applicable regulations in the servicing of our students and institutions could subject us to fines or restrictions on or loss of our ability to participate in Title IV programs. We contract with unaffiliated entities for student software systems and services related to the administration of portions of our Title IV and financing programs. Because each of our institutions may be jointly and severally liable for the actions of third-party servicers and vendors, failure of such servicers to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our institutions, including fines and the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. If any of our third-party servicers discontinues providing such services to us, we may not be able to replace such third-party servicer in a timely, cost-efficient, or effective

 manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with collection, lending, and Title IV requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. We provide financing programs to assist some of our students in affording our educational offerings. These programs are subject to various federal and state rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge loans, and other injunctive requirements. If we, or one of the companies that service our credit programs, do not comply with laws applicable to the financing programs that assist our students in affording our educational offerings, including Truth in Lending and Fair Debt Collections Practices laws and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, we could be subject to fines, penalties, obligations to discharge the debts, and other injunctive requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Additionally, an adverse allegation, finding or outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain, obtain or renew licenses, approvals or accreditation and maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or serve as a basis for ED to discharge certain Title IV student loans and seek recovery for some or all of its resulting losses from us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Release of confidential information could subject us to civil penalties or cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. As an educational institution participating in federal and state student assistance programs and collecting financial receipts from enrollees or their sponsors, we collect and retain certain confidential information. Such information is subject to federal and state privacy and security rules, including the Family Education Right to Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Release or failure to secure confidential information or other noncompliance with these rules could subject us to fines, loss of our capacity to conduct electronic commerce, and loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We could be subject to sanctions if we fail to accurately and timely report sponsored students tuition, fees, and enrollment to the sponsoring agency. A significant portion of our enrollment is sponsored through various federal and state supported agencies and programs, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. We are required to periodically report tuition, fees, and enrollment to the sponsoring agencies. As a recipient of funds, we are subject to periodic reviews and audits. Inaccurate or untimely reporting could result in suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in these federal and state programs and have a material adverse impact on enrollment and revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our enrollment may be adversely affected by presentations of data that are not representative of actual educational costs for our prospective students. ED and other public policy organizations are concerned with the affordability of higher education and have developed various tools and resources to help students find low-cost educational alternatives. These resources primarily rely on and present data for first-time, full-time residential students, which is not representative of most of our prospective students. These presentations may influence some prospective students to exclude our institutions from their consideration, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 Risks Related to Adtalem s Business Outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health pandemics in the locations in which we, our students, faculty, and employees live, work, and attend classes, could substantially harm our business. Disease outbreaks and other public health conditions in the locations in which we, our students, faculty, and employees live, work, and attend classes could have a significant negative impact on our revenue, profitability, and business. If our business experiences prolonged occurrences of adverse public health conditions and the reinstatement of stay-at-home orders, we believe it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We will continue to evaluate, and if appropriate, adopt other measures in the future required for the ongoing safety of our students and employees. If our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted, then assets such as accounts receivable, property and equipment, operating lease assets, intangible assets and goodwill could be impaired, requiring a possible write-off. As of June 30, 2023, intangible assets from business combinations totaled 812.3 million and goodwill totaled 961.3 million. Natural disasters or other extraordinary events or political disruptions may cause us to close some of our schools . We may experience business interruptions resulting from natural disasters, inclement weather, transit disruptions, political disruptions, or other events in one or more of the geographic areas in which we operate, particularly in the West Coast and Gulf States of the U.S., and the Caribbean. These events could cause us to close schools, temporarily or permanently, and could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenue to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Student enrollment at our schools is affected by legislative, regulatory, and economic factors that may change in ways we cannot predict. These factors outside our control limit our ability to assess our future enrollment effectively. Our future revenue and growth depend on a number of factors, including many of the regulatory risks discussed above and business risks discussed below. Despite ongoing efforts to provide more scholarships to prospective students, and to increase quality and build our reputation, negative perceptions of the value of a college degree, increased reluctance to take on debt, and the resulting lower student consumer confidence may continue to impact enrollment in the future. In addition, technological innovations in the delivery of low-cost education alternatives and increased competition could negatively affect enrollment. We are subject to risks relating to enrollment of students. If we are not able to continue to successfully recruit and retain our students, our revenue may decline. Our undergraduate and graduate educational programs are concentrated in selected areas of medical and healthcare. If applicant career interests or employer needs shift away from these fields, and we do not anticipate or adequately respond to that trend, future enrollment and revenue may decline and the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could decline. If our graduates are unable to find appropriate employment opportunities or obtain professional licensure or certification, we may not be able to recruit new students. If employment opportunities for our graduates in fields related to their educational programs decline or they are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications in their chosen fields, future enrollment and revenue may decline as potential applicants choose to enroll at other educational institutions or providers. We face heightened competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions. Postsecondary education in our existing and new market areas is highly competitive and is becoming increasingly so. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year colleges, other proprietary schools, and alternatives to higher education. Some of our competitors, both public and private, have greater financial and nonfinancial resources than us. Some of our competitors, both public and private, are able to offer programs similar to ours at a lower tuition level

 for a variety of reasons, including the availability of direct and indirect government subsidies, government and foundation grants, large endowments, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions, or by providing fewer student services or larger class sizes. An increasing number of traditional colleges and community colleges are offering distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are geared towards the needs of working adults. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increasing competition for students from traditional colleges, including colleges with well-established reputations for excellence. As the online and distance learning segment of the postsecondary education market matures, we believe that the intensity of the competition we face will continue to increase. This intense competition could make it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, which could adversely affect our new student enrollment levels and student persistence and put downward pressure on our tuition rates, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft, or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data, and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees and contractors in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition or in connection with system upgrades from time to time. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students financial information and grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. For example, in December 2020 it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified a single server in our environment with SolarWinds software installed. It is important to note that this single server was used only for IP address management and was not configured in a manner that could allow for system compromise. Out of an abundance of caution, we promptly took steps to deactivate the server after applying all vendor recommended patches and hotfixes. We also scanned the environment to validate that there were no indicators of compromise related to the software. While we believe there were no compromises to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Anyone who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot assure that a breach, loss, or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, customers, employees, or contractors that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by federal or state authorities and private litigants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. System disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our computer network or information systems could severely impact our ability to serve our existing students and attract new students. The performance and reliability of our computer networks and system applications, especially online educational platforms and student operational and financial aid packaging applications, are critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students. System errors, disruptions or failures, including those arising from unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, and other security threats, could adversely impact our delivery of educational content to our students or result in delays and/or errors in processing student financial aid and related disbursements. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of our institutions, our financial

 condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against system errors, failures or disruptions, or the threat of security breaches, or to repair or otherwise mitigate problems caused by any actual errors, disruptions, failures, or breaches. We cannot ensure that these efforts will protect our computer networks, or fully mitigate the resulting impact of interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, despite our regular monitoring of our technology infrastructure security and business continuity plans. A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for operating our business. We could experience theft of sensitive date or confidential information or reputational damage from malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, students, or business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect and respond to. There can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our operations and business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Government regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow. The use of the internet and other online services has led to and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulations in the U.S. or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations, and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, value-added taxes, withholding taxes, cost of internet access, and services, allocation, and apportionment of income amongst various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions, fair business practices, and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our ability to open new campuses, offer new programs, and add capacity is dependent on regulatory approvals and requires financial and human resources. As part of our strategy, we intend to open new campuses, offer new educational programs, and add capacity to certain existing locations. Such actions require us to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, adding new locations, programs, and capacity may require significant financial investments and human resource capabilities. The failure to obtain appropriate approvals or to properly allocate financial and human resources could adversely impact our future growth. We may not be able to attract, retain, and develop key employees necessary for our operations and the successful execution of our strategic plans . We may be unable to attract, retain, and develop key employees with appropriate educational qualifications and experience. Regulatory and other legal actions and the claims contained in these actions may have diminished our reputation, and these actions and the resulting negative publicity may have decreased interest by potential employees. In addition, we may be unable to effectively plan and prepare for changes in key employees. Such matters may cause us to incur higher wage expense and/or provide less student support and customer service, which could adversely affect enrollment, revenue, and expense. A significant amount of our compensation for key employees is tied to our financial performance. We may require new employees in order to execute some of our strategic plans. Uncertainty regarding our future financial performance may limit our ability to attract new employees with competitive compensation or increase our cost of recruiting and retaining such new employees.

 We may not be able to successfully identify, pursue, or integrate acquisitions. As part of our strategy, we are actively considering acquisition opportunities primarily in the U.S. We have acquired and expect to acquire additional education institutions or education related businesses that complement our strategic direction. Any acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: Inability to successfully integrate the acquired operations and personnel into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures; Failure to secure applicable regulatory approvals; Assumption of known and unknown liabilities; Diversion of significant attention of our senior management from day-to-day operations; Issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including compliance issues, commitments, and/or contingencies; and Financial commitments, investments in foreign countries, and compliance with debt covenants and ED financial responsibility scores. Expansion into new international markets will subject us to risks inherent in international operations. To the extent that we expand internationally, we will face risks that are inherent in international operations including, but not limited to: Compliance with foreign laws and regulations; Management of internal operations; Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; Ability to protect intellectual property; Monetary policy risks, such as inflation, hyperinflation, and deflation; Price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies; Political and economic instability in the countries in which we operate; Potential unionization of employees under local labor laws; Multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws; Inability to cost effectively repatriate cash balances; and Compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Proposed changes in, or lapses of, U.S. tax laws regarding earnings from international operations could adversely affect our financial results. Our effective tax rate could be subject to volatility or be adversely impacted by changes to federal tax laws governing the taxation of foreign earnings of U.S. based companies. For example, recent changes to U.S. tax laws significantly impacted how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws, due in part to recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s OECD s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS project, including the imposition of a global minimum tax. A significant portion of the additional provisions for income taxes we have made due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act is payable by us over a period of up to eight years. As a result, our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full. In addition, Adtalem has benefitted from the ability to enter into international intercompany arrangements without incurring U.S. taxation due to a law, which expires in fiscal year 2026, deferring U.S. taxation of foreign personal holding company income such as foreign income from dividends, interest, rents, and royalties. If this law is not extended, or a similar law adopted, our consolidated tax provision would be impacted beginning in our fiscal year 2027, and we may not be able to allocate international capital optimally without realizing U.S. income taxes, which would increase our effective income tax rate and adversely impact our earnings and cash flows.

 Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by: earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of or lapses in various tax law provisions; tax treatment of stock-based compensation; costs related to intercompany or other restructurings; or other changes in tax rates, laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we have accrued tax and related interest for potential adjustments to tax liabilities for prior years, there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material effect, either positive or negative, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our goodwill and intangible assets potentially could be impaired if our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted by risks and uncertainties. Adtalem s market capitalization can be affected by, among other things, changes in industry or market conditions, changes in results of operations, and changes in forecasts or market expectations related to future results. If our market capitalization were to remain below its carrying value for a sustained period of time or if such a decline becomes indicative that the fair values of our reporting units have declined below their carrying values, an impairment test may result in a non-cash impairment charge. As of June 30, 2023, intangible assets from business combinations totaled 812.3 million and goodwill totaled 961.3 million. Together, these assets equaled 63 of total assets as of such date. If our business results and financial condition were materially and adversely impacted, then such intangible assets and goodwill could be impaired, requiring a possible write-off of up to 812.3 million of intangible assets and up to 961.3 million of goodwill. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be utilized to the full value approved or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Repurchases we consummate could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could have a negative impact on our available cash balance. Our Board authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 300.0 million of our common stock through February 25, 2025. As of June 30, 2023, 172.7 million of authorized share repurchases were remaining under this share repurchase program. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase program authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Further, our share repurchases could have an impact on our share trading prices, increase the volatility of the price of our common stock, or reduce our available cash balance such that we will be required to seek financing to support our operations. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our common stock. Even if our share repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value. We and our subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our debt obligations. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our and our subsidiaries financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, because we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, repayment of our indebtedness is also dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and other than the guarantors on our indebtedness, they do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose or for other obligations. Pursuant to applicable state limited liability company laws and other laws and regulations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to us in order

 to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes (as defined in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and our Term Loan B (as defined in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . In the event that we do not receive distributions from our non-guarantor subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. In addition, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Revolver (as defined in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default, and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders (including the lenders under the credit facilities and the holders of the Notes) could foreclose against the assets securing their loans and the Notes and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Risks Related to Shareholder Activism We may face risks associated with shareholder activism. Publicly traded companies are subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions related to matters such as corporate governance, operational practices, and strategic direction. We have previously been subject to shareholder activity and demands and may be subject to further shareholder activity and demands in the future. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Adtalem s leased facilities are occupied under leases whose remaining terms range from 1 to 12 years. Some of our leases contain provisions giving Adtalem the right to terminate early or renew its lease for additional periods at various rental rates, although generally at rates higher than are currently being paid. Adtalem s owned facilities total approximately 883,000 square feet worldwide. No facility that is owned by Adtalem is subject to a mortgage or other indebtedness. Adtalem is leasing space to DeVry University at one facility owned by Adtalem. Adtalem is subleasing space, in full or in part, at an additional seven facilities, of which five are subleased to DeVry University and/or Carrington College (a business formerly owned by Adtalem). Adtalem remains the primary lessee on the seven underlying leases. These lease and sublease agreements were entered into at comparable market rates and the terms range from one to three years. Chamberlain Chamberlain s home office is located in Chicago, Illinois. Chamberlain currently operates 23 campuses in various U.S. locations, of which 3 are in Adtalem owned locations and 20 in leased facilities. Chamberlain s total portfolio of academic and administrative operations comprise approximately 1.0 million square feet.

Segments We present three reportable segments as follows: Chamberlain Offers degree and non-degree programs in the nursing and health professions postsecondary education industry. This segment includes the operations of Chamberlain University Chamberlain ). Walden Offers more than 100 online certificate, bachelor s, master s, and doctoral degrees, including those in nursing, education, counseling, business, psychology, public health, social work and human services, public administration and public policy, and criminal justice. This segment includes the operations of Walden University Walden ), which was acquired by Adtalem on August 12, 2021. See Note 3 Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on the acquisition. Medical and Veterinary Offers degree and non-degree programs in the medical and veterinary postsecondary education industry. This segment includes the operations of the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine AUC ), Ross University School of Medicine RUSM ), and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine RUSVM ), which are collectively referred to as the medical and veterinary schools. Home Office and Other includes activities not allocated to a reportable segment. Financial and descriptive information about Adtalem s reportable segments is presented in Note 22 Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, Adtalem eliminated its Financial Services segment when the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists ACAMS ), Becker Professional Education Becker ), OnCourse Learning OCL ), and EduPristine were classified as discontinued operations and assets held for sale. In accordance with GAAP, we have classified the ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine entities as Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in all periods presented as applicable. As a result, all financial results, disclosures, and discussions of continuing operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K exclude ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine operations, unless otherwise noted. On March 10, 2022, we completed the sale of ACAMS, Becker, and OCL and on June 17, 2022, we completed the sale of EduPristine. In addition, we continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, which was completed during fiscal year 2019, and those costs are classified as expense within discontinued operations. See Note 4 Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discontinued operations information. Certain expenses previously allocated to ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine within our former Financial Services segment during fiscal year 2021 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 have been reclassified to Home Office and Other based on discontinued operations reporting guidance regarding allocation of corporate overhead. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, these costs are being allocated to the Chamberlain, Walden, and Medical and Veterinary segments. Revision to Previously Issued Financial Statements During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, Adtalem identified an error in its revenue recognition related to certain scholarship programs within its Medical and Veterinary segment. Certain scholarships and discounts offered within that segment provide students a discount on future tuition that constitute a material right under Accounting Standards

Table of Contents 
 Codification ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers that should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation within a contract. Adtalem assessed the materiality of this error individually and in the aggregate with other previously identified errors to prior periods Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 99 Materiality and SAB 108 Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements codified in ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. Adtalem concluded that the errors were not material to prior periods and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required. However, Adtalem determined it was appropriate to revise its previously issued financial statements. Treating the discount on future tuition as a material right results in the deferral of revenue for a portion of tuition to future periods. In accordance with ASC 250, Adtalem corrected prior periods presented herein by revising the financial statement line item amounts previously disclosed in SEC filings in order to achieve comparability in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this revision, Adtalem also corrected other immaterial errors in the prior periods, including certain errors that had previously been adjusted for as out of period corrections in the period identified. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. Walden University Acquisition On August 12, 2021, Adtalem completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding equity interest in Walden e-Learning, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company e-Learning ), and its subsidiary, Walden University, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, from Laureate Education, Inc. Laureate or Seller in exchange for a purchase price of 1.5 billion in cash (the Acquisition ). See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD A for a discussion on the financing used to fund the Acquisition. Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights Financial and operational highlights for fiscal year 2023 include: Adtalem revenue increased 69.0 million, or 5.0 , to 1,450.9 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. Excluding the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, Adtalem revenue grew 4.8 million, or 0.3 , in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year driven by increased revenue at Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary partially offset by a revenue decline at Walden. 
 Net income of 93.4 million 2.05 diluted earnings per share) decreased 217.6 million 4.38 diluted earnings per share) in fiscal year 2023 compared to net income of 311.0 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to the gain on disposal of the Financial Services segment in the prior year, partially offset by decreased interest expense and business acquisition and integration expense in the current year compared to the prior year, and a gain on sale of assets in the current year. Adjusted net income of 192.2 million 4.21 diluted adjusted earnings per share) increased 40.2 million 1.10 diluted adjusted earnings per share), or 26.4 , in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. This increase was due to the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, increased adjusted operating income at Chamberlain, and decreased interest expense in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. 
 For fiscal year 2023, average total student enrollment at Chamberlain decreased 0.6 compared to the prior year . For the May 2023 session, total student enrollment at Chamberlain increased 1.2 compared to the same session last year. For fiscal year 2023, average total student enrollment at Walden decreased 7.5 compared to the prior year .

 On March 14, 2022, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ASR agreement to repurchase 150.0 million of common stock. We received an initial delivery of 4,709,576 shares of common stock. The ASR agreement ended on October 14, 2022. Based on the volume-weighted average price of Adtalem s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, Adtalem owed the counter party 332,212 shares of common stock. We elected to settle the contract in cash instead of delivering shares by making a cash payment of 13.2 million on November 2, 2022. Adtalem repurchased a total of 3,207,036 shares of Adtalem s common stock under its share repurchase program at an average cost of 39.68 per share during fiscal year 2023. The timing and amount of any future repurchases will be determined based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. 
 Overview of the Impact of COVID-19 On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has had tragic consequences across the globe and altered business and consumer activity across many industries. Management initiated several changes to the operations of our institutions and administrative functions in order to protect the health of our students and employees and to mitigate the financial effects of COVID-19 and its resultant economic slowdown. Management believes that enrollments were negatively impacted at Chamberlain and Walden, and to a lesser extent at Medical and Veterinary, by disruptions in the nursing and healthcare markets caused by COVID-19. The amount of revenue, operating income, and earnings per share losses in fiscal year 2023 and 2022 driven by this disruption are not quantifiable. While the COVID-19 public health emergency has ended, management believes that the stress caused by COVID-19 on healthcare professionals still affects decisions on pursuing healthcare professions and furthering education and may negatively affect enrollment in our healthcare programs. In fiscal year 2022, we experienced higher variable expenses associated with bringing students back to campus and providing a safe environment in the context of COVID-19 as in-person instruction returned at Chamberlain and the medical and veterinary schools. Although COVID-19 has had a negative effect on the operating results of all five reporting units that contain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2023, none of the effects are considered significant enough to create an impairment triggering event during fiscal year 2023. In addition, our annual impairment assessment performed as of May 31, 2023 did not identify any impairments.

Enrollment has begun to recover in several graduate and doctoral programs and the undergraduate Bachelor of Science-Nursing BSN programs. These improvements have been partially offset by a decrease in total student enrollment in the Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing RN-to-BSN online degree program. Management believes this decrease and the slow recovery in enrollment may partially be driven by prolonged stress on healthcare professionals. While the COVID-19 public health emergency has ended, management believes that the stress caused by COVID-19 on healthcare professionals still affects decisions on pursuing healthcare professions and furthering education and may have negatively affected enrollment in our healthcare programs in fiscal year 2023. Chamberlain s revenue and our ability to provide educational services are not materially exposed to the economic impact from the volatile supply chain disruptions impacting the current global macroeconomic environment. Chamberlain currently operates 23 campuses in 15 states, including Chamberlain s newest campus in Irwindale, California, which began instruction in May 2021. Tuition Rates: Tuition for the BSN onsite and online degree program ranges from 675 to 753 per credit hour. Tuition for the RN-to-BSN online degree program is 590 per credit hour. Tuition for the online Master of Science in Nursing MSN degree program is 675 per credit hour. Tuition for the online Family Nurse Practitioner FNP degree program is 690 per credit hour. Tuition for the online Doctor of Nursing Practice DNP degree program is 800 per credit hour. Tuition for the online Master of Public Health MPH degree program is 550 per credit hour. Tuition for the online Master of Social Work MSW degree program is 695 per credit hour. Tuition for the onsite Master of Physician Assistant Studies MPAS is 8,000 per session. Some of these tuition rates increased by 3 to 4 from the prior year. These tuition rates do not include the cost of course fees, books, supplies, transportation, clinical fees, living expenses, or other fees as listed in the Chamberlain academic catalog.

 Walden total student enrollment represents those students attending instructional sessions as of the dates identified above. Walden revenue increased 10.0 , or 48.3 million, to 533.7 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. Excluding the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, Walden revenue decreased 3.3 , or 15.8 million. In fiscal year 2022, 8.6 million was excluded from revenue due to an adjustment required for purchase accounting to record Walden s deferred revenue at fair value. Fiscal year 2023 did not require a similar adjustment. Excluding the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year and the 8.6 million deferred revenue adjustment, revenue decreased 4.9 , or 24.4 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. Management believes that the decrease in total enrollment compared to the prior year, which is resulting in the lower revenue, may be driven by prolonged stress on healthcare professionals. While the COVID-19 public health emergency has ended, management believes that the stress caused by COVID-19 on healthcare professionals still affects decisions on pursuing healthcare professions and furthering education and may have negatively affected enrollment in our healthcare programs in fiscal year 2023. Walden s revenue and our ability to provide educational services are not materially exposed to the economic impact from the volatile supply chain disruptions impacting the current global macroeconomic environment. Tuition Rates: On a per credit hour basis, tuition for Walden programs range from 130 per credit hour to 1,060 per credit hour, with the wide range due to the nature of the programs. General education courses are charged at 333 per credit hour. Other programs such as those with a subscription-based learning modality or those billed on a subscription period or term basis range from 1,500 to 7,180 per term. Students are charged a technology fee that ranges from 50 to 230 per term as well as a clinical fee of 150 per course for specific programs. Some programs require students to attend residencies, skills labs, and pre-practicum labs, which are charged at a range of 1,000 to 2,550 per event. In most cases, these tuition rates, event charges, and fees represent increases of approximately 3.0 to 6.6 from the prior year. These tuition rates, event charges, and fees do not include the cost of books or personal technology, supplies, transportation, or living expenses.

Medical and Veterinary s revenue and our ability to provide educational services are not materially exposed to the economic impact from the volatile supply chain disruptions impacting the current global macroeconomic environment. Management is executing its plan to differentiate the medical and veterinary schools from the competition, with a core goal of increasing international students, increasing affiliations with historically black colleges and universities HBCU and Hispanic-serving institutions HSI ), expanding AUC s medical education program based in the U.K. in partnership with the University of Central Lancashire UCLAN ), and improving the effectiveness of marketing and enrollment investments.

All of these tuition rates represent a 5.0 increase from the prior academic year. 
 The respective tuition rates for AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM do not include the cost of transportation, living expenses, or health insurance. Cost of Educational Services The largest component of cost of educational services is the cost of faculty and staff who support educational operations. This expense category also includes the costs of facilities, adjunct faculty, supplies, housing, bookstore, other educational materials, student education-related support activities, and the provision for bad debts. We have not experienced significant inflationary pressures on wages or other costs of delivering our educational services; however, should inflation persist in the overall economy, cost increases could affect our results of operations in the future.

Excluding the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, cost of educational services decreased 5.2 , or 34.3 million, in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. This cost decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction efforts across all institutions and the effect of workforce reductions which occurred in the prior year.

 As a percentage of revenue, cost of educational services was 44.7 in fiscal year 2023 compared to 47.7 in the prior year. The decrease in the percentage was primarily the result of cost reduction efforts and the influence of Walden s higher gross margins, which impacted the full fiscal year 2023 compared to only a portion of fiscal year 2022. Walden s fully online operating model results in lower comparable cost of educational services. Student Services and Administrative Expense The student services and administrative expense category includes expenses related to student admissions, marketing and advertising, general and administrative, and amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets related to business acquisitions. We have not experienced significant inflationary pressures on wages or other costs of providing services to our students and educational institutions; however, should inflation persist in the overall economy, cost increases could affect our results of operations in the future.

Excluding the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, intangible amortization expense, litigation reserve, and CEO transition costs, student services and administrative expense increased 4.3 , or 24.6 million, in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. This cost increase was primarily driven by an increase in marketing expense, partially offset by cost reduction at home office. As a percentage of revenue, student services and administrative expense was 40.4 in fiscal year 2023 compared to 41.0 in the prior year. The decrease in the percentage was primarily the result of a decrease in intangible amortization expense in fiscal year 2023 and a decrease in CEO transition costs incurred in fiscal year 2022, partially offset by the litigation reserve in fiscal year 2023. Restructuring Expense Restructuring expense in fiscal year 2023 was 18.8 million compared to 25.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in restructuring expense in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by a reduction in severance charges related to workforce reductions. See Note 6 Restructuring Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on restructuring charges. We continue to incur restructuring charges or reversals related to exited leased space from previous restructuring activities.

 Business Acquisition and Integration Expense Business acquisition and integration expense in fiscal year 2023 was 42.7 million compared to 53.2 million in the prior year. These are transaction costs associated with acquiring Walden and costs associated with integrating Walden into Adtalem. In addition, during fiscal year 2023, we initiated transformation initiatives to accelerate growth and organizational agility. Certain costs relating to this transformation are included in business acquisition and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect to incur additional integration costs in fiscal year 2024. Gain on Sale of Assets On July 31, 2019, Adtalem sold its Chicago, Illinois, campus facility to DePaul College Prep Foundation DePaul College Prep for 52.0 million. Adtalem received 5.2 million of cash at the time of closing and held a mortgage, secured by the property, from DePaul College Prep for 46.8 million. The mortgage was due on July 31, 2024 as a balloon payment and bore interest at a rate of 4 per annum, payable monthly. DePaul College Prep had an option to make prepayments. Due to Adtalem s involvement with financing the sale, the transaction did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes at the time of closing. Adtalem continued to maintain the assets associated with the sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded a note receivable of 40.3 million and a financing payable of 45.5 million at the time of the sale, which were classified as other assets, net and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February 23, 2023, DePaul College Prep paid the mortgage in full. Upon receiving full repayment of the mortgage, Adtalem no longer is involved in the financing of the sale and therefore derecognized the note receivable, the financing payable, and the assets associated with the campus facility, which resulted in recognizing a gain on sale of assets of 13.3 million in fiscal year 2023. This gain was recorded at Adtalem s home office, which is classified as Home Office and Other in Note 22 Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The primary drivers of the operating income increase in fiscal year 2023 were revenue increases at Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary, cost reduction efforts across all institutions, the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, decreased CEO transition costs, decreased business acquisition and integration expense, decreased intangible amortization expense, and the gain on sale of assets, partially offset by increased marketing expense. The decrease in amortization expense is driven by the decrease in amortization relating to the student relationships intangible asset. This intangible asset is amortized based on the estimated retention of the students and considers the revenue and cash flow associated with these existing students, which are concentrated at the beginning of the asset s useful life. Consolidated adjusted operating income increased 7.5 , or 20.0 million, to 287.6 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. The primary drivers of the adjusted operating income increase were revenue increases at

 Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary, cost reduction efforts across all institutions, and the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year, partially offset by increased marketing expense. Chamberlain Chamberlain operating income increased 8.3 , or 10.3 million, to 134.7 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. Segment adjusted operating income increased 6.5 , or 8.3 million, to 135.5 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. The primary driver of the increase in adjusted operating income in fiscal year 2023 was the result of increased revenue and labor cost reductions. Walden Walden operating income was 35.9 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to operating loss of 5.3 million in the prior year that was impacted by intangible amortization expense and the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Segment adjusted operating income increased 5.5 , or 5.8 million, to 110.4 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. The primary driver of the increase in adjusted operating income in fiscal year 2023 was the timing of the Walden acquisition in the prior year. Medical and Veterinary Medical and Veterinary operating income increased 0.5 , or 0.3 million, to 59.6 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. Segment adjusted operating income decreased 2.6 , or 1.8 million, to 67.3 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year. The primary driver of the decrease in adjusted operating income in fiscal year 2023 was the result of increased marketing expense. Interest Expense Interest expense in fiscal year 2023 was 63.1 million compared to 129.3 million in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of decreased borrowings in fiscal year 2023 compared to the prior year due to prepayments of debt and a result of the prior year incurring charges due to the write-off of issuance costs on the Prior Credit Facility and unused bridge fee (as defined and discussed in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). This decrease in interest expense was partially offset by rising interest rates on outstanding Term Loan B debt. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan B debt was 9.19 and 5.60 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other Income, Net Other income, net in fiscal year 2023 was 7.0 million compared to 1.1 million in the prior year. The increase in other income, net was primarily the result of an increase in interest income, partially offset by a 5.0 million investment impairment of an equity investment. (Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate ETR from continuing operations can differ from the 21 U.S. federal statutory rate due to several factors, including tax on global intangible low-taxed income GILTI ), limitation of tax benefits on certain executive compensation, the rate of tax applied by state and local jurisdictions, the rate of tax applied to earnings outside the U.S., tax incentives, tax credits related to research and development expenditures, changes in valuation allowance, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits on stock-based compensation awards. Our income tax provision from continuing operations was 10.3 million in fiscal year 2023 and our income tax benefit from continuing operations was 15.5 million in fiscal year 2022. In addition, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded a net tax benefit of 6.4 million for the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on our reassessment of the amount of state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized. The net benefit is comprised of the release of a valuation allowance of 9.3 million offset by a reduction in state net operating loss carryforwards of 2.3 million and a revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a tax rate change of 0.6 million.

 2023 resulted in an income tax provision compared to an income tax benefit in the prior year primarily due to the impacts recognized in the prior year related to the Walden acquisition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act requires taxpayers to capitalize and subsequently amortize research and experimental R E expenditures that fall within the scope of Internal Revenue Code Section 174 for tax years starting after December 31, 2021. This rule became effective for Adtalem during fiscal year 2023 and resulted in the deferred tax asset for capitalization of R E costs of 8.1 million, based on interpretation of the law as currently enacted. Adtalem will capitalize and amortize these costs for tax purposes over 5 years for R E performed in the U.S. and over 15 years for R E performed outside of the U.S. Discontinued Operations Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine operations were classified as discontinued operations. In addition, we continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, which was completed during fiscal year 2019, and are classified as expense within discontinued operations. Net loss from discontinued operations in the year ended June 30, 2023 was 8.4 million. This loss consisted of the following: (i) loss of 8.5 million driven by ongoing litigation costs and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, partially offset by income from the DeVry University earn-out; (ii) a loss on the sale of ACAMS, Becker, and OCL of 3.6 million for working capital adjustments to the initial sales price and a tax return to provision adjustment; and (iii) a benefit from income taxes of 3.6 million associated with the items listed above. Net income from discontinued operations in the year ended June 30, 2022 was 346.9 million. This income consisted of the following: (i) loss of 1.0 million driven by ongoing litigation costs and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, partially offset by the operating results related to ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine, and income from the DeVry University earn-out; (ii) a gain on the sale of ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine of 473.5 million; and (iii) a provision for income taxes of 125.6 million associated with the items listed above.

Management believes that a decrease in total student enrollment in several programs, with the most pronounced being in the RN-to-BSN online degree program, may have been partially by driven by prolonged COVID-19 disruptions in the healthcare industry. Tuition Rates (2022): Tuition for the BSN onsite and online degree program ranged from 675 to 699 per credit hour. Tuition for the RN-to-BSN online degree program was 590 per credit hour. Tuition for the online MSN degree program was 650 per credit hour. Tuition for the online FNP degree program was 665 per credit hour. Tuition for the online DNP degree program was 775 per credit hour. Tuition for the online MPH degree program was 550 per credit hour. Tuition for the online MSW degree program was 695 per credit hour. All of these tuition rates were unchanged from fiscal year 2021, except for the BSN rates which were 675 to 730 per credit hour in fiscal year 2021. These tuition rates do not include the cost of course fees, books, supplies, transportation, clinical fees, living expenses, or other fees as listed in the Chamberlain academic catalog. Walden Walden Student Enrollment: 

Fiscal Year 2022 September 30, December 31, March 31, June 30, Period 2021 2021 2022 2022 Total students 44,886 41,158 42,788 39,470 Walden total student enrollment represents those students attending instructional sessions as of the dates identified above. Walden revenue was 485.4 million in fiscal year 2022, which includes the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment of 8.6 million. There was no comparable revenue in fiscal year 2021 as Adtalem acquired Walden on August 12, 2021. Management believes that the decrease in total enrollment during fiscal year 2022 may have been partially driven by prolonged COVID-19 disruptions in the healthcare industry and the negative publicity surrounding the now concluded U.S. Department of Justice inquiry into potential false representations and false advertising to students. This inquiry ultimately concluded favorably, with no findings of misconduct by Walden. In addition, the uncertainty from potential students around the change in control and the Walden acquisition may have negatively affected enrollment. Tuition Rates (2022): On a per credit hour basis, tuition for Walden programs ranged from 123 per credit hour to 1,020 per credit hour, with the wide range due to the nature of the programs. General education courses were charged at 333 per credit hour. Other programs such as those with a subscription-based learning modality or those billed on a subscription period or term basis ranged from 1,500 to 6,970 per term. Students were charged a technology fee that ranged from 50 to 220 per

 term as well as a clinical fee of 150 per course for specific programs. Some programs require students to attend residencies, skills labs, and pre-practicum labs, which were charged at a range of 938 to 2,475 per event. These tuition rates, event charges, and fees do not include the cost of books or personal technology, supplies, transportation, or living expenses.

In the September 2021 semester, total student enrollment increased at AUC but declined at RUSM and RUSVM. In the January 2022 and May 2022 semesters, total student enrollment increased at AUC and RUSM but declined at RUSVM. Previous declines in total student enrollment at RUSM were partially driven by the inability to offer clinical experiences to all students caused by an increase in students waiting to pass their USMLE Step 1 exam. If a student has not yet started in a clinical program, is not eligible to be enrolled in a clinical program, or not participating in other educational experiences, they are not included in the enrollment count for that semester. In the January 2022 and May 2022 semesters, this clinical backlog continued to decrease. Management believes increased competition for students and hesitancy on participating in on campus instruction were drivers of lower total student enrollment in the basic science programs at RUSM and RUSVM. Tuition Rates (2022): Effective for semesters beginning in September 2021, tuition rates for the beginning basic sciences and final clinical rotation portions of AUC s medical program were 23,800 and 26,625, respectively, per semester. These tuition rates represented a 2.4 increase from the prior academic year. Effective for semesters beginning in September 2021, tuition rates for the beginning basic sciences and final clinical rotation portions of RUSM s medical program were 24,750 and 27,310, respectively, per semester. These tuition rates represented a 2.4 increase from the prior academic year. For students who entered the RUSVM program in September 2018 or later, the tuition rate for the pre-clinical (Semesters 1-7) and clinical curriculum (Semesters 8-10) was 21,603 per semester effective September 2021. For students who entered RUSVM before September 2018, tuition rates for the pre-clinical and clinical curriculum were 20,066 and 25,190, respectively, per semester effective September 2021. All of these tuition rates represented a 3.5 increase from the prior academic year. 
 The respective tuition rates for AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM do not include the cost of transportation, living expenses, or health insurance. Cost of Educational Services The largest component of cost of educational services is the cost of faculty and staff who support educational operations. This expense category also includes the costs of facilities, adjunct faculty, supplies, housing, bookstore, other educational materials, student education-related support activities, and the provision for bad debts. We have not yet experienced significant inflationary pressures on wages or other costs of delivering our educational services; however, should inflation

Excluding the effect of the Walden acquisition, cost of educational services decreased 0.2 , or 0.8 million, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Decreased costs excluding Walden in fiscal year 2022 were primarily driven by cost reduction efforts across all institutions, partially offset by return to campus cost increases at Chamberlain. As a percentage of revenue, cost of educational services was 47.7 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 50.9 in fiscal year 2021 . The decrease in the percentage was primarily the result of the influence of Walden s higher gross margins. Walden s fully online operating model results in lower comparable cost of educational services. Student Services and Administrative Expense The student services and administrative expense category includes expenses related to student admissions, marketing and advertising, general and administrative, and amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets related to business acquisitions. We have not yet experienced significant inflationary pressures on wages or other costs of providing services to our students and educational institutions; however, should inflation persist in the overall economy, cost increases could affect our results of operations in the future.

 costs excluding Walden in fiscal year 2022 were primarily driven by cost reduction efforts across all institutions and home office. As a percentage of revenue, student services and administrative expense was 41.0 in fiscal year 2022 compared to 32.5 in fiscal year 2021. The increase in the percentage was primarily the result of an increase in Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary marketing expense, intangible amortization expense, and CEO transition costs. Restructuring Expense Restructuring expense in fiscal year 2022 was 25.6 million compared to 6.9 million in fiscal year 2021. The increased restructure expense in fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by workforce reductions and contract terminations related to synergy actions with regard to the Walden acquisition and Medical and Veterinary and Adtalem s home office real estate consolidations. See Note 6 Restructuring Charges to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on restructuring charges. Business Acquisition and Integration Expense Business acquisition and integration expense in fiscal year 2022 was 53.2 million compared to 31.6 million in fiscal year 2021. These were transaction costs associated with acquiring Walden and costs associated with integrating Walden into Adtalem.

Excluding the effect of the Walden acquisition, total consolidated operating income decreased 28.3 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The primary drivers of the operating income decrease in fiscal year 2022 were decreased revenue at Chamberlain, increased costs at Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary for return to campus, increased marketing expense at Chamberlain and Medical and Veterinary, CEO transition costs, increased restructuring costs, and increased business acquisition and integration costs. Consolidated operating income excluding special items increased 79.8 , or 118.7 million, in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The primary driver of the operating income excluding special items increase was the addition of operating income excluding special items from Walden. Chamberlain Chamberlain operating income decreased 3.4 , or 4.4 million, to 124.4 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Segment operating income excluding special items decreased 1.2 , or 1.6 million, to 127.3 million in fiscal

 year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Cost reduction efforts and a decrease in employee benefit costs were offset with a decrease in revenue, increased costs for return to campus, and increased marketing expense. Walden Walden operating loss was 5.3 million in fiscal year 2022, which was impacted by intangible amortization expense and the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Segment operating income excluding special items was 104.6 million in fiscal year 2022. There was no comparable operating income in fiscal year 2021 as Adtalem acquired Walden on August 12, 2021. Medical and Veterinary Medical and Veterinary operating income decreased 1.4 , or 0.8 million, to 59.4 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Segment operating income excluding special items increased 14.9 , or 8.9 million, to 69.1 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. The primary drivers of the increase in operating income excluding special items were cost reduction efforts and decreased employee benefit costs. Interest Expense Interest expense in fiscal year 2022 was 129.3 million compared to 41.4 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of increased borrowings (as discussed in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to finance the Walden acquisition and fiscal year 2022 incurring charges due to the write-offs of issuance costs on the Prior Credit Facility and unused bridge fee (as defined and discussed in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). Other Income, Net Other income, net in fiscal year 2022 was 1.1 million compared to 6.7 million in fiscal year 2021. The decrease in other income, net was primarily the result of an investment loss incurred on the rabbi trust investments in fiscal year 2022 compared to an investment gain in fiscal year 2021. See Note 7 Other Income, Net to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on these investment gains and losses. Benefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes Our income tax benefit from continuing operations was 15.5 million in fiscal year 2022 and our income tax expense from continuing operations was 12.3 million in fiscal year 2021. The fiscal year 2022 income tax benefit was the result of the loss incurred in fiscal year 2022. The effective tax rate included a tax benefit of 1.7 million from a loss for certain uncollectible subsidiary receivables as well as a benefit of 1.2 million to adjust deferred state tax balances for the acquisition of Walden and the sale of ACAMS, Becker, and OCL, offset by 3.0 million for limitations on deductions for executive compensation. Discontinued Operations Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine operations were classified as discontinued operations. In addition, we continue to incur costs associated with ongoing litigation and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture, which was completed during fiscal year 2019, and are classified as expense within discontinued operations. Net income from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 was 347.0 million. This income consisted of the following: (i) loss of 1.0 million driven by the operating results and divestiture costs related to ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine, and ongoing litigation costs and settlements to the DeVry University divestiture; (ii) a gain on the sale of ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine of 473.5 million; and (iii) a provision for income taxes of 125.6 million associated with the items listed above.

 Net income from discontinued operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 was 6.1 million. This income consisted of the following: (i) income of 9.3 million driven by the operating results of ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine and ongoing litigation costs and settlements related to the DeVry University divestiture and (ii) a provision for income taxes of 3.2 million associated with the items listed above. Regulatory Environment Like other higher education companies, Adtalem is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of federal financial aid funds. All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act HEA guides the federal government s support of postsecondary education. If there are changes to financial aid programs that restrict student eligibility or reduce funding levels, Adtalem s financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of student financial aid related risks. In addition, government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding. If the U.S. Department of Education ED determines that we have failed to demonstrate either financial responsibility or administrative capability in any pending program review, or otherwise determines that an institution has violated the terms of its Program Participation Agreement PPA ), we could be subject to sanctions including: fines, penalties, reimbursement for discharged loan obligations, a requirement to post a letter of credit, and/or suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. Chamberlain was most recently recertified and issued an unrestricted PPA in September 2020, with an expiration date of March 31, 2024. Walden was issued a Temporary Provisional PPA TPPPA on September 17, 2021 in connection with their acquisition by Adtalem. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, ED provisionally recertified AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM s Title IV PPAs with expiration dates of December 31, 2022, March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The lengthy PPA recertification process is such that ED allows unhampered continued access to Title IV funding after PPA expiration, so long as materially complete applications are submitted at least 90 days in advance of expiration. Complete applications for PPA recertification have been timely submitted to ED. The provisional nature of the existing agreements for AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM stemmed from increased and/or repeated Title IV compliance audit findings. Walden s TPPPA included financial requirements, which were in place prior to acquisition, such as a letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring, and additional reporting. No similar requirements were imposed on AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM. While corrective actions have been taken to resolve past compliance matters and eliminate the incidence of repetition, if AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM fail to maintain administrative capability as defined by ED while under provisional status or otherwise fail to comply with ED requirements, the institution(s) could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which could have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. ED may alternatively issue new PPAs for continued Title IV participation. Walden must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution s PPA. In addition, ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution, or make any other significant change. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its PPA, it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Walden is currently on a TPPPA which is required for participation in Title IV programs on a month-to-month basis. Walden s

 provisional certification prior to acquisition was due to Walden s prior parent company (Laureate Education Inc.) failing composite score under ED s financial responsibility standards and ED s approval of Laureate s initial public offering in February 2017, which it viewed as a change in control. As a result of Adtalem s acquisition of Walden, the provisional nature of Walden s PPA remains in effect on a month-to-month basis while ED reviews the change in ownership application relating to the acquisition of Walden by Adtalem. Walden also is subject to a letter of credit and is subject to additional cash management requirements with respect to its disbursements of Title IV funds, as well as a restriction on changes to its educational programs, including a prohibition on the addition of new programs or locations that had not been approved by ED prior to the change in ownership during the period in which Walden participates under provisional certification (either as a result of the change in ownership or because of the continuation of the financial responsibility letter of credit). Adtalem had a surety-backed letter of credit outstanding of 84.0 million as of June 30, 2023 in favor of the ED on behalf of Walden, which allows Walden to participate in Title IV programs. On January 18, 2023, we received a letter from ED, requesting Adtalem to provide a letter of credit in the amount of 76.2 million related to ED s review of the Same Day Balance Sheet, which is the consolidated Adtalem balance sheet as of August 12, 2021, the date of the Walden acquisition. On February 21, 2023, Adtalem provided the 76.2 million letter of credit to ED. An ED regulation known as the 90/10 Rule affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90 of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the Rescue Act enacted on March 11, 2021 amended the 90/10 rule to require that a proprietary institution derive no more than 90 of its revenue from federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. This change was subject to negotiated rulemaking, which ended in March 2022. The amended rule applies to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs as calculated under the current regulations (excluding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. Final data for fiscal year 2023 is not yet available. As institution s 90/10 compliance must be calculated using the financial results of an entire fiscal year, we are including Walden s amounts for the full fiscal year 2022 in the table below, including the portion of the year not under Adtalem s ownership. 

Fiscal Year 2022 2021 Chamberlain University 65 66 Walden University 73 n/a American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine 81 80 Ross University School of Medicine 85 85 Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine 81 82 Consolidated 72 73 An ED defined financial responsibility test is required for continued participation by an institution in Title IV aid programs. For Adtalem s institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. Applying various financial elements from the fiscal year audited financial statements, the test is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible but require additional oversight. These institutions are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, an institution with a score of less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10 of the Title IV aid it received in the institution s most recent fiscal year). For the past several years, Adtalem s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. As a result of the acquisition of Walden, Adtalem expects ED will conclude its consolidated composite score will fall below 1.5. As a result, ED may impose certain additional conditions for continued access to federal funding including heightened cash monitoring

 and/or an additional letter of credit. Management does not believe such conditions, if any, will have a material adverse effect on Adtalem s operations. ED also has proposed rules to amend the financial responsibility regulations. We anticipate any rules will be effective on July 1, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources Adtalem s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition, fees, books, and other educational materials. These payments include funds originating as financial aid from various federal and state loan and grant programs, student and family educational loans, employer educational reimbursements, scholarships, and student and family financial resources. Adtalem continues to provide financing options for its students, including Adtalem s credit extension programs. The pattern of cash receipts during the year is seasonal. Adtalem s cash collections on accounts receivable peak at the start of each institution s term. Accounts receivable reach their lowest level at the end of each institution s term. Adtalem s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of 273.7 million and 347.0 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included cash and cash equivalents held at Adtalem s international operations of 7.2 million and 34.2 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is available to Adtalem for general corpora te purposes. Under the terms of Adtalem institutions participation in financial aid programs, certain cash received from state governments and ED is maintained in restricted bank accounts. Adtalem receives these funds either after the financial aid authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student is completed, or just prior to that authorization. Once the authorization and disbursement process for a particular student is completed, the funds may be transferred to unrestricted accounts and become available for Adtalem to use in operations. This process generally occurs during the academic term for which such funds have been authorized. Cash in the amount of 1.4 million and 1.0 million was held in these restricted bank accounts as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash Flow Summary Operating Activities The following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating activities (in thousands): 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Income (loss) from continuing operations 101,752 (35,955) Non-cash items 196,924 283,158 Changes in assets and liabilities (92,992) (83,201) Net cash provided by operating activities-continuing operations 205,684 164,002 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in fiscal year 2023 was 205.7 million compared to 164.0 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by a decrease in interest payments and improvements in our operating results. The decrease of 86.2 million in non-cash items between fiscal year 2023 and 2022 was principally driven by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, a decrease in amortization and write-off of debt discount and issuance costs, and an increase in gain on sale of assets. The decrease of 9.8 million in cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to timing differences in accounts receivable, prepaid assets, prepaid income taxes, accounts payable, accrued payroll and benefits, accrued liabilities, accrued interest, and deferred revenue. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 were 37.0 million compared to 31.1 million in the prior year. The capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 primarily consisted of spending for Chamberlain s new campus development and improvements and Adtalem s home office, including information technology investments. Capital spending for fiscal year 2024 will support continued investment for new campus development at Chamberlain, maintenance at the medical and 
 67 

Table of Contents 
 veterinary schools, and information technology. Management anticipates fiscal year 2024 capital spending to be in the 50 to 60 million range. The source of funds for this capital spending will be from operations or the Credit Facility (as defined and discussed in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). During fiscal year 2023 and 2022, we received proceeds from the sale of marketable securities held in a Rabbi Trust of 7.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively, and made additional investments in marketable securities held by this trust of 1.5 million and 3.6 million, respectively. The reinvestments in proceeds declined in fiscal year 2023 as funds were used to payout participant balances under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. On July 31, 2019, Adtalem sold its Chicago, Illinois, campus facility to DePaul College Prep for 52.0 million. Adtalem received 5.2 million of cash at the time of closing and held a mortgage loan, secured by the property, from DePaul College Prep for 46.8 million. The mortgage loan was due on July 31, 2024 as a balloon payment and bore interest at a rate of 4 per annum, payable monthly. The buyer had an option to make prepayments. On February 23, 2023, DePaul College Prep paid the mortgage loan in full. The 46.8 million received during fiscal year 2023 is classified as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. On August 12, 2021, Adtalem completed the acquisition of 100 of the equity interest of Walden for 1,488.1 million, net of cash and restricted cash of 83.4 million. During fiscal year 2022, we received the loan repayment of 10.0 million on the DeVry University promissory note, dated as of December 11, 2018. On March 10, 2022, Adtalem completed the sale of ACAMS, Becker, and OCL to Wendel Group and Colibri Group Purchaser ), pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement Purchase Agreement dated January 24, 2022. Adtalem received 962.7 million, net of cash of 21.5 million, in sale proceeds. On June 17, 2022, Adtalem completed the sale of EduPristine for de minimis consideration, which resulted in a transfer of 1.9 million in cash to EduPristine. During fiscal year 2023, we paid 3.2 million for a working capital adjustment to the initial sales price for ACAMS, Becker, and OCL. Financing Activities The following table provides a summary of cash flows from financing activities (in thousands): 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Repurchases of common stock for treasury (123,133) (120,000) Payment on equity forward contract (13,162) (30,000) Net repayments of long-term debt (150,861) (229,713) Payment of debt discount and issuance costs (49,553) Payment for purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest of subsidiary (1,790) Other (1,359) 6,580 Net cash used in financing activities (288,515) (424,476) On November 8, 2018, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s eleventh share repurchase program, which allowed Adtalem to repurchase up to 300.0 million of its common stock through December 31, 2021. The eleventh share repurchase program commenced in January 2019 and was completed in January 2021. On February 4, 2020, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s twelfth share repurchase program, which allowed Adtalem to repurchase up to 300.0 million of its common stock through December 31, 2021. The twelfth share repurchase program commenced in January 2021 and expired on December 31, 2021. On March 1, 2022, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s thirteenth share repurchase program, which allows Adtalem to repurchase up to 300.0 million of its common stock through February 25, 2025, and we repurchased shares under that program during fiscal year 2023. As of June 30, 2023, 172.7 million of authorized share repurchases were remaining under the current share repurchase program. The timing and amount of any

Table of Contents 
 future repurchases will be determined based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. See Note 16 Share Repurchases to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our share repurchase programs. On March 14, 2022, we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase 150.0 million of common stock. We received an initial delivery of 4,709,576 shares of common stock representing approximately 80 of the total shares expected to be delivered at the time of executing the ASR based on the per share price on the day prior to the execution date. The final number of shares to be repurchased was based on the volume-weighted average price of Adtalem s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement. The ASR agreement ended on October 14, 2022. Based on the volume-weighted average price of Adtalem s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, Adtalem owed the counter party 332,212 shares of common stock. We elected to settle the contract in cash instead of delivering shares by making a cash payment of 13.2 million on November 2, 2022. On March 24, 2020, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreement (the Swap with a multinational financial institution to mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our Prior Term Loan B (as defined in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data debt. We paid interest at a fixed rate of 0.946 and received variable interest of one-month LIBOR (subject to a minimum of 0.00 ), on a notional amount equal to the amount outstanding under the Prior Term Loan B. The effective date of the Swap was March 31, 2020 and settlements with the counterparty occurred on a monthly basis. The Swap was set to terminate on February 28, 2025. On July 29, 2021, prior to refinancing our Prior Credit Agreement (as discussed below), we settled and terminated the Swap for 4.5 million, which resulted in a charge to interest expense for this amount in fiscal year 2022. During the operating term of the Swap, the annual interest rate on the amount of the Prior Term Loan B was fixed at 3.946 (including the impact of the 3 interest rate margin on LIBOR loans) for the applicable interest rate period. The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and as such, changes in its fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income within interest expense in the periods in which the hedged transactions affected earnings. As discussed in the previous section of this MD A titled Walden University Acquisition, on August 12, 2021, Adtalem acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interest in Walden, in exchange for a purchase price of 1.5 billion in cash. On March 1, 2021, we issued 800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Notes ), which mature on March 1, 2028. On August 12, 2021, Adtalem replaced the Prior Credit Facility and Prior Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data by entering into its new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for (1) a 850.0 million senior secured term loan Term Loan B with a maturity date of August 12, 2028 and (2) a 400.0 million senior secured revolving loan facility Revolver with a maturity date of August 12, 2026. We refer to the Term Loan B and Revolver collectively as the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Notes and the Term Loan B were used, among other things, to finance the Acquisition, refinance Adtalem s Prior Credit Agreement, and pay fees and expenses related to the Acquisition. The Revolver will be used to finance ongoing working capital and for general corporate purposes. During fiscal year 2022, we made a prepayment of 396.7 million on the Term Loan B. With that prepayment, we are no longer required to make quarterly installment payments. On April 11, 2022, we repaid 373.3 million of Notes at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes. During June 2022, we repurchased on the open market an additional 20.8 million of Notes at a price equal to approximately 90 of the principal amount of the Notes, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of 2.1 million recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2022. In July 2022, we repurchased an additional 0.9 million of Notes, on September 22, 2022, we made a prepayment of 100.0 million on the Term Loan B, and on November 22, 2022, we made a prepayment of 50.0 million on the Term Loan B. As of June 30, 2023, the amount of debt outstanding under the Notes and Credit Facility was 708.3 million. See Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on the Notes and our Credit Agreement. In the event of unexpected market conditions or negative economic changes, including those caused by COVID-19, that could negatively affect Adtalem s earnings and/or operating cash flow, Adtalem maintains a 400.0 million revolving credit facility with availability of 323.8 million as of June 30, 2023. While COVID-19 may continue to have an effect on operations and, as a result, liquidity, we believe the current balances of cash, cash generated from operations, and our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund both Adtalem s current domestic and international operations and growth plans for the foreseeable future.

 Material Cash Requirements Long-Term Debt We have outstanding 405.0 million of Notes and 303.3 million of Term Loan B, which requires interest payments. With the prepayment noted above, we are no longer required to make quarterly principal installment payments on the Term Loan B. In addition, we maintain a 400.0 million revolving credit facility with availability of 323.8 million as of June 30, 2023. Adtalem has a letter of credit outstanding under this revolving credit facility of 76.2 million as of June 30, 2023, in favor of ED on behalf of Walden, which allows Walden to participate in Title IV programs. See Note 14 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our Notes and Credit Agreement. Adtalem had a surety-backed letter of credit outstanding of 84.0 million as of June 30, 2023, in favor of ED on behalf of Walden, which allows Walden to participate in Title IV programs. Many states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted 31.9 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Walden, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. Operating Lease Obligations We have operating lease obligations for the minimum payments required under various lease agreements which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we sublease certain space to third parties, which partially offsets the lease obligations at these facilities. See Note 12 Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our lease agreements. Contingencies For information regarding legal proceedings, including developments in legal proceedings, see Note 21 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Critical Accounting Estimates We describe our significant accounting policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates discussed below are those that we believe involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Management has discussed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board. Although management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of (i) the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) rising interest rates, and (iii) labor and material cost increases and shortages, and how we anticipate them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from what was anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in our accounts receivable balances as of each balance sheet date. In evaluating the collectability of all our accounts receivable balances, we utilize historical events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The estimate of our credit losses involves a significant level of uncertainty as it requires significant judgment to estimate the amount we will collect in the future on our account receivable balances. See Note 10 Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our credit losses.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset or asset group. Events that may trigger an impairment analysis could include a decision by management to exit a market or a line of business or to consolidate operating locations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is May 31. We have the option to assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that the reporting unit fair value is more likely than not less than its carrying value, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit s fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. We also have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If it is determined that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value. For intangible assets with finite lives, we evaluate for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset or asset group. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected economic lives, ranging from 3 to 5 years. All intangible assets and certain goodwill are being amortized for tax reporting purposes over statutory lives. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Significant assumptions used in the determination of reporting unit fair value measurements generally include forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. The discounted cash flow models used to determine the fair value of our Walden reporting unit during 2023 reflected our most recent cash flow projections, a discount rate of 12.5 and terminal growth rates of 3 . Each of these inputs can significantly affect the fair values of our reporting units. Based on this quantitative assessment, it was determined that the fair value of the Walden reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15 and therefore no goodwill impairment was identified. Significant judgments and assumptions were used in determining the fair value of intangible assets. The with and without method of the income approach and the relief from royalty model used in the determination of the fair values of our Walden Title IV eligibility and trade name intangible assets, respectively, during 2023 reflected our most recent revenue projections, a discount rate of 12.5 , a royalty rate of 2.25 and terminal growth rates of 3 . Each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Based on these quantitative assessments, it was determined that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Walden reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by approximately 10 and no impairment was identified. Management bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If economic conditions deteriorate, interest rates continue to rise, or operating performance of our reporting units do not meet expectations such that we revise our long-term forecasts, we may recognize impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.

 13 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis. Income Taxes Adtalem accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Adtalem also recognizes future tax benefits associated with tax loss and credit carryforwards as deferred tax assets. Adtalem s deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, when in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Adtalem measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which Adtalem expects to recover or settle the temporary differences. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted. Adtalem reduces its net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions Adtalem has taken. Contingencies Adtalem is subject to contingencies, such as various claims and legal actions that arise in the normal conduct of its business. We record an accrual for those matters where management believes a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. For those matters for which we have not recorded an accrual, their possible impact on Adtalem s business, financial condition, or results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. See Note 21 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on our loss contingencies. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations We believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Adtalem s ongoing operations as seen through the eyes of management and are useful for period-over-period comparisons. We use these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally in our assessment of performance and budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following are non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Adjusted net income (most comparable GAAP measure: net income attributable to Adtalem) Measure of Adtalem s net income attributable to Adtalem adjusted for deferred revenue adjustment, CEO transition costs, restructuring expense, business acquisition and integration expense, intangible amortization expense, gain on sale of assets, pre-acquisition interest expense, write-off of debt discount and issuance costs, gain on extinguishment of debt, litigation reserve, investment impairment, net tax benefit related to a valuation allowance release, and net loss (income) from discontinued operations attributable to Adtalem. Adjusted earnings per share (most comparable GAAP measure: earnings per share) Measure of Adtalem s diluted earnings per share adjusted for deferred revenue adjustment, CEO transition costs, restructuring expense, business acquisition and integration expense, intangible amortization expense, gain on sale of assets, pre-acquisition interest expense, write-off of debt discount and issuance costs, gain on extinguishment of debt, litigation reserve, investment impairment, net tax benefit related to a valuation allowance release, and net loss (income) from discontinued operations attributable to Adtalem.

 Adjusted operating income (most comparable GAAP measure: operating income) Measure of Adtalem s operating income adjusted for deferred revenue adjustment, CEO transition costs, restructuring expense, business acquisition and integration expense, intangible amortization expense, litigation reserve, and gain on sale of assets. This measure is applied on a consolidated and segment basis, depending on the context of the discussion. Adjusted EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: net income attributable to Adtalem) Measure of Adtalem s net income attributable to Adtalem adjusted for net loss (income) from discontinued operations attributable to Adtalem, interest expense, other income, net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred revenue adjustment, CEO transition costs, restructuring expense, business acquisition and integration expense, litigation reserve, and gain on sale of assets. This measure is applied on a consolidated and segment basis, depending on the context of the discussion. Income taxes, interest expense, and other income, net is not recorded at the reportable segments, and therefore, the segment adjusted EBITDA reconciliations begin with operating income (loss). A description of special items in our non-GAAP financial measures described above are as follows: Deferred revenue adjustment related to a revenue purchase accounting adjustment to record Walden s deferred revenue at fair value. CEO transition costs related to acceleration of stock-based compensation expense. Restructuring expense primarily related to plans to achieve synergies with the Walden acquisition and real estate consolidations at Walden, Medical and Veterinary, and Adtalem s home office. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our restructuring expense. Business acquisition and integration expense include expenses related to the Walden acquisition and certain costs related to growth transformation initiatives. We do not include normal, recurring, cash operating expenses in our business acquisition and integration expense. Intangible amortization expense on acquired intangible assets. Gain on sale of Adtalem s Chicago, Illinois, campus facility. Pre-acquisition interest expense related to financing arrangements in connection with the Walden acquisition, write-off of debt discount and issuance costs and gain on extinguishment of debt related to prepayments of debt, reserves related to significant litigation, and impairment of an equity investment. Net tax benefit related to a valuation allowance release. Net loss (income) from discontinued operations attributable to Adtalem includes the operations of ACAMS, Becker, OCL, and EduPristine, including the after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses, in addition to costs related to DeVry University. 
 The following tables provide a reconciliation from the most directly comparable GAAP measure to these non-GAAP financial measures. The operating income reconciliation is included in the results of operations section within this MD A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Adtalem is not dependent upon the price levels, nor affected by fluctuations in pricing, of any particular commodity or group of commodities. However, more than 50 of Adtalem s costs are in the form of wages and benefits. Changes in employment market conditions or escalations in employee benefit costs could cause Adtalem to experience cost increases at levels beyond what it has historically experienced. We have not yet experienced significant inflationary pressures on wages or other costs of delivering our educational services; however, should inflation persist in the overall economy, cost increases could affect our results of operations in the future.

 The financial position and results of operations of AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM Caribbean operations are measured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Substantially all of their financial transactions are denominated in the U.S. dollar. As of June 30, 2023, the interest rate on Adtalem s Term Loan B was based upon LIBOR for eurocurrency rate loans or an alternative base rate for periods typically ranging from one to three months. On June 27, 2023, Adtalem entered into Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, identifying the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as the replacement benchmark rate for eurocurrency rate loans within the Credit Agreement. Beginning with the next interest rate reset in July 2023, the base rate will change to SOFR. As of June 30, 2023, Adtalem had 303.3 million in outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B with an interest rate of 9.19 . Based upon borrowings of 303.3 million, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would result in 3.0 million of additional annual interest expense. Adtalem s cash is held in accounts at various large, financially secure depository institutions. Although the amount on deposit at a given institution typically will exceed amounts subject to guarantee, Adtalem has not experienced any deposit losses to date, nor does management expect to incur such losses in the future.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Adtalem Global Education Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adtalem Global Education Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
 78 

Table of Contents 
 and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Impairment Assessments Walden Reporting Unit Goodwill, Trade Name and Title IV Eligibility and Accreditations As described in Notes 2 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, as of June 30, 2023, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 961 million and the Company s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was 753 million. The goodwill, trade name and Title IV eligibility and accreditations associated with the Walden reportable segment were 651 million, 120 million and 496 million, respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Management performs a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit s and indefinite-lived intangible asset s fair value if it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not less than the carrying value, or if management does not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment. Fair value is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow method and the market multiple valuation approach for the Walden reporting unit, a relief-from-royalty method for the Walden trade name and a with and without method in a discounted cash flow model for the Walden Title IV eligibility and accreditations. The significant estimates used by management when estimating the fair value for the Walden reporting unit, trade name and Title IV eligibility and accreditations were risk-adjusted discount rates, terminal growth rate, earnings multiples for comparable companies, royalty rate, and forecasted revenue with and without the accreditations in place and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA with and without the accreditations in place. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of the Walden reporting unit goodwill, trade name, and Title IV eligibility and accreditations is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to (a) risk-adjusted discount rate, forecasted revenue, forecasted EBITDA, and earnings multiples for comparable companies for the goodwill impairment assessment, (b) risk-adjusted discount rate, forecasted revenue, and royalty rate for the trade name impairment assessment and (c) risk-adjusted discount rate, forecasted revenue with and without the accreditations in place, and forecasted EBITDA with the accreditations in place for the Title IV eligibility and accreditations ; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s Walden goodwill, trade name and Title IV eligibility and accreditation impairment assessments. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method and the market multiple valuation approach for the Walden reporting unit, the relief-from-royalty method for the Walden trade name and the with and without method in a discounted cash flow model for the Walden Title IV eligibility and accreditations; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the fair value methods; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to risk-adjusted discount rates, forecasted revenue, forecasted EBITDA, earnings multiples for comparable companies, royalty rate, forecasted revenue with and without the accreditations in place, and

Table of Contents 
 forecasted EBITDA with the accreditations in place. Evaluating management s assumptions related to forecasted revenue, forecasted EBITDA, forecasted revenue with and without the accreditations in place and forecasted EBITDA with the accreditations in place involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Walden business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company s discounted cash flow model, the market multiple valuation approach, the relief-from-royalty method, and the with and without method in a discounted cash flow model, and (ii) the reasonableness of the risk-adjusted discount rates, royalty rate and earnings multiples for comparable companies assumptions. /s/ August 10, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since 1991.

 to . All intangible assets and certain goodwill are being amortized for tax reporting purposes over statutory lives. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Management bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates, which could lead to future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets. See Note 13 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional information on our goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis. , and amortization is included within cost of education services in the Consolidated Statements of Income. discount, to the Adtalem Colleague Stock Purchase Plan in exchange for employee payroll deductions. The discount is considered compensatory and recorded as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When treasury shares are reissued, Adtalem uses an average cost method to reduce the treasury stock balance. Gains on the difference between the average cost and the reissuance price, less the amount recorded as expense, are credited to additional paid-in capital. Losses on the difference are charged to additional paid-in capital to the extent that previous net gains from reissuance are included therein, otherwise such losses are charged to retained earnings.

 of the equity interest of Walden for million, net of cash and restricted cash of million. Adtalem funded the purchase with the million in Notes (as defined in Note 14 Debt ), the million Term Loan B (as defined in Note 14 Debt ), and available cash on hand. Walden offers more than online certificate, bachelor s, master s, and doctoral degrees. The acquisition furthers Adtalem s growth strategy as a national leader in post-secondary education and leading provider of professional talent to the healthcare industry. The operations of Walden are included in Adtalem s Walden reportable segment (see Note 22 Segment Information ). The results of Walden s operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Adtalem since the date of acquisition, which included revenue of million and net loss of million from the operations of Walden in fiscal year 2022. In addition, we incurred acquisition-related costs of million and million in fiscal year 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in business acquisition and integration expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The gross amount due under contracts is million, of which million was expected to be uncollectible. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, was all assigned to the Walden reporting unit and reportable segment. The entire goodwill amount is tax deductible. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill includes Walden s strategic fit into Adtalem s healthcare educator strategy, the reputation of the Walden brand as a leader in online education industry, and potential future growth opportunity.

 million was assigned to trade names, each of which has been determined not to be subject to amortization. Curriculum The Title IV eligibility and accreditations intangible asset was valued using the with and without method of the income approach. The student relationships intangible asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. The trade name intangible asset was valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The curriculum intangible asset was valued using the cost to replace method. Significant judgments and assumptions were used in these valuations. We applied judgment which involved the use of significant assumptions with respect to the discount rate and recovery period for the Title IV eligibility and accreditations intangible asset and royalty rate and discount rate for the trade name intangible asset. We also applied judgment which involved the use of assumptions, including the discount rate and EBITDA margin for the student relationships intangible asset and labor rates and hours and obsolescence rate for the curriculum intangible asset. Net income attributable to Adtalem The unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied from July 1, 2020, with the consequential tax effects. The unaudited pro forma financial information also includes adjustments to reflect the additional interest expense on the debt we issued to fund the acquisition (see Note 14 Debt for additional information). As the ticking fees are representative of the historical interest expense incurred by Adtalem on the Term Loan B from the period of February 12, 2021 to August 12, 2021 and the unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal year 2021 has been adjusted to include interest expense assuming the Term Loan B had been entered into as of July 1, 2020, we have made a further adjustment to remove the ticking fees recognized in the unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal year 2022 (see Note 14 Debt for additional information on ticking fees). Had the Term Loan B been drawn upon on July 1, 2020, none of the ticking fees would have been incurred and, accordingly, the inclusion of such amounts would be duplicative to the interest expense incurred by Adtalem on a pro forma basis. The acquisition transaction costs we incurred in connection with the Walden acquisition are reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information results for fiscal year 2021. This unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only. It does not reflect the integration of the business or any synergies that may result from the acquisition.

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Adtalem sold the issued and outstanding shares of ACAMS, Becker, and OCL to the Purchaser for million, net of cash of million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition, on June 17, 2022, Adtalem completed the sale of EduPristine for de minimis consideration, which resulted in a transfer of million in cash. We recorded a loss of million in fiscal year 2023 for post-closing working capital adjustments to the initial sales price for ACAMS, Becker, and OCL and a tax return to provision adjustment, which is included in (loss) gain on disposal of discontinued operations before income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These divestitures are the culmination of a long-term strategy to sharpen the focus of our portfolio and enhance our ability to address the growing and unmet demand for healthcare professionals in the U.S. As these sales represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on Adtalem s operations and financial results, these businesses previously included in our former Financial Services segment are presented in Adtalem s Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.

Performance Obligations and Revenue Recognition Tuition and fees : The majority of revenue is derived from tuition and fees, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the academic term as instruction is delivered. Other : Other revenue consists of housing and other miscellaneous services. Other revenue is recognized over the period in which the applicable performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements for payment are agreed to prior to registration of the student s first academic term. The majority of U.S. students obtain Title IV or other financial aid resulting in institutions receiving a significant amount of the transaction price at the beginning of the academic term. Students not utilizing Title IV or other financial aid funding may pay after the academic term is complete. Transaction Price Revenue, or transaction price, is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or services. Students may receive discounts, scholarships, or refunds, which gives rise to variable consideration. The amounts of discounts or scholarships are generally applied to individual student accounts when such amounts are awarded. Therefore, the transaction price is immediately reduced directly by these discounts or scholarships from the amount of the standard tuition rate charged. Scholarships and discounts that are only applied to future tuition charged are considered a separate performance obligation if they represent a material right in accordance with ASC 606. In those instances, we defer the value of the related performance obligation associated with the future scholarship or discount based on estimates of future redemption based on our historical experience of student persistence toward completion of study. The contract liability associated with these material rights are presented as deferred revenue within current liabilities and other liabilities within noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the amounts expected to be redeemed in the next 12 months. The contract liability amount associated with these material rights within current liabilities is million and million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the amount within noncurrent liabilities is million and million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 million as of June 30, 2023 and mainly relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets was million as of June 30, 2022 and relates to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 and increased by million in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Insufficient projected taxable income in certain jurisdictions gives rise to the need for a valuation allowance. Based on Adtalem s expectations for future taxable income, management believes that it is more likely than not that operating income in other respective jurisdictions will be sufficient to recognize fully all deferred tax assets. Our income tax provisions or benefits from continuing operations were million tax provision, million tax benefit, and million tax provision in fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Fiscal year 2023 resulted in an income tax provision compared to an income tax benefit in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to the impacts recognized in fiscal year 2022 related to the Walden acquisition. In addition, in fiscal year 2023, we recorded a net tax benefit of million for the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on our reassessment of the amount of state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized. The net benefit is comprised of the release of a valuation allowance of million offset by a reduction in state net operating loss carryforwards of million and a revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a tax rate change of million. The income tax benefits in fiscal year 2022 and the income tax expense in fiscal years 2023 and 2021 reflect the U.S. federal tax rate of adjusted for taxes related to global intangible low-taxed income GILTI ), state and local taxes, benefits of the foreign rate differences, tax credits related to research and development expenditures, a net tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards, and benefits associated with local tax incentives. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, was million and million, respectively, which if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease during the next 12 months due to the settlement of various audits and the lapsing of statutes of limitation. We estimate this decrease to be immaterial. Adtalem classifies interest and penalties on tax uncertainties as a component of the provision for income taxes. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 was million and million, respectively. Interest and penalties expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were a net increase of million, million, and million, respectively.

These credit extension programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, fees, and books, and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM allow students to finance their living expenses. Repayment plans for financing agreements are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges at rates from to per annum accrue each month on the unpaid balance once a student withdraws or graduates from a program. Most students are required to begin repaying their loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay, which reduces the possibility of over borrowing. Payments may increase upon completing or departing school. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan. Credit Quality The primary credit quality indicator for our financing receivables is delinquency. Balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become past due. We write-off financing receivable balances after they have been sent to a third-party collector, the timing of which varies by the institution granting the loan, but in most cases is when the financing agreement is at least 181 days past due. Payments are applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance. 31-60 days past due 61-90 days past due 91-120 days past due 121-150 days past due Greater than 150 days past due Total past due Current Financing receivables, gross

In evaluating the collectability of all our accounts receivable balances, we utilize historical events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. For our trade receivables, we primarily use historical loss rates based on an aging schedule and a student s status to determine the allowance for credit losses. As these trade receivables are short-term in nature, management believes a student s status provides the best credit loss estimate, while also factoring in delinquency. Students still attending classes, recently graduated, or current on payments are more likely to pay than those who are inactive due to being on a leave of absence, withdrawing from school, or not current on payments. For our financing receivables, we primarily use historical loss rates based on an aging schedule. As these financing receivables are based on long-term financing agreements offered by Adtalem, management believes that delinquency provides the best credit loss estimate. As the financing receivable balances become further past due, it is less likely we will receive payment, causing our estimate of credit losses to increase.

Adtalem received million of cash at the time of closing and held a mortgage, secured by the property, from DePaul College Prep for million. The mortgage was due on July 31, 2024 as a balloon payment and bore interest at a rate of per annum, payable monthly. The buyer had an option to make prepayments. Due to Adtalem s involvement with financing the sale, the transaction did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes. Adtalem continued to maintain the assets associated with the sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded a note receivable of million and a financing payable of million at the time of the sale, which were classified as other assets, net and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10 Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses for a discussion on the discounting of the note receivable. On February 23, 2023, DePaul College Prep paid the mortgage in full. The million received during fiscal year 2023 is classified as an investing activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Upon receiving full repayment of the mortgage, Adtalem no longer is involved in the financing of the sale and therefore derecognized the note receivable, the financing payable, and the assets associated with the campus facility, which resulted in recognizing a gain on sale of assets of million in fiscal year 2023.

The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease, as well as any periods for which we are reasonably certain to exercise extension options. We elected to account for lease and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs) as a single lease component for all operating leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have not entered into any financing leases. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease assets are adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentives, initial direct costs, and impairments. Our

All sublease expirations with DeVry University and Carrington College coincide with Adtalem s original head lease expiration dates. At that time, Adtalem will be relieved of its obligations. In addition, Adtalem has entered into subleases with non-affiliated entities for vacated or partially vacated space from restructuring activities.

Student relationships is amortized based on the estimated retention of the students and giving consideration to the revenue and cash flow associated with these existing students. Indefinite-lived intangible assets related to trade names and Title IV eligibility and accreditations are not amortized, as there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangible assets to the reporting entity. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. There were no triggering events in fiscal year 2023 and our annual testing date is May 31. Adtalem has reporting units that contain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2023. These reporting units constitute components for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have the option to assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is determined that the reporting unit fair value is more likely than not less than its carrying value, or if we do not elect the option to perform an initial qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit s fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. We also have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived

 reporting units, significant changes in cash flows of the reporting unit level or individual indefinite-lived intangible asset level, if applicable, as well as how much previously calculated fair values exceeded carrying values to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Based on the qualitative assessment of the reporting units, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units or individual indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying values. As of May 31, 2023, we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment for the Walden trade name and Walden Title IV eligibility and accreditation indefinite-lived intangible assets, and therefore performed a quantitative assessment of the respective fair values. In determining fair value of the Walden trade name indefinite-lived intangible asset, we used the relief-from-royalty method. The significant estimates used in this valuation approach are the risk-adjusted discount rate of , forecasted revenue, a terminal revenue growth rate of and a royalty rate of . In determining fair value of the Walden Title IV eligibility and accreditation indefinite-lived intangible asset, we used the with and without method in a discounted cash flow model. The significant estimates used in this valuation approach are the risk-adjusted discount rate of , forecasted revenue with and without the accreditations in place, and forecasted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA with and without the accreditations in place. Based on these quantitative assessments, it was determined that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Walden reporting unit exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was identified. As of May 31, 2023, we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our Walden reporting unit and therefore performed a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit s fair value. In determining fair value of the Walden reporting unit, we used the discounted cash flow method and the market multiple valuation approach. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model are the risk-adjusted discount rate of , forecasted revenue and EBITDA, and terminal growth rates of . The significant estimates used in the market multiple valuation approach include earnings multiples for comparable companies. Based on this quantitative assessment, it was determined that the fair value of the Walden reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill impairment was identified. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Management bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. If economic conditions deteriorate, interest rates continue to rise, or operating performance of our Walden or other reporting units do not meet expectations such that we revise our long-term forecasts, we may recognize impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods.

 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total Senior Secured Notes due 2028 On March 1, 2021, Adtalem Escrow Corporation (the Escrow Issuer ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adtalem, issued million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Notes ), which mature on March 1, 2028, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 1, 2021 (the Indenture ), by and between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and notes collateral agent. The Notes were sold within the U.S. only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and outside the U.S. to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Escrow Issuer deposited the net proceeds of the offering, along with certain additional funds, into a segregated depositary account (the Escrow Account ). On August 12, 2021, Adtalem used the net proceeds of the offering, along with other financing sources, to finance the purchase price paid in connection with the Walden acquisition, repay the then existing million senior secured term loan B, and to pay related acquisition fees and expenses. On August 12, 2021, the Escrow Issuer merged with and into Adtalem, with Adtalem continuing as the surviving corporation (the Escrow Merger ), and Adtalem assumed all of the Escrow Issuer s obligations under the Notes, the Indenture, any supplemental indentures thereto, the applicable collateral documents, and the other applicable documents (the Assumption and subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions, the net proceeds from the offering and the other additional funds were released from the Escrow Account to the Issuer or its designee. The term Issuer refers (a) prior to the Assumption, to the Escrow Issuer and (b) from and after the Assumption, to Adtalem. The Notes were issued at of their par value. The Notes bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2021, to holders of record on the preceding February 15 and August 15, as the case may be. The Notes were initially the senior secured obligations of the Escrow Issuer, secured only by the amounts deposited in the Escrow Account. As of August 12, 2021, the Notes are guaranteed by certain of Adtalem s subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors under its senior secured credit facilities and certain of its other senior indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions (the Guarantors ). As of August 12, 2021, the Notes are secured, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, by first priority liens on the same collateral that secures the obligations under Adtalem s senior secured credit facilities. At any time prior to March 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after March 1, 2024 at redemption prices equal to , and of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed if the redemption occurs during the twelve-month periods beginning on March 1 of the years 2024, 2025, and 2026 and thereafter, respectively, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to March 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds the Issuer receives from one or more qualifying equity offerings. On April 11, 2022, we repaid million of Notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes.

 million of Notes at a price equal to approximately of the principal amount of the Notes, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2023. This debt was subsequently retired. Accrued interest on the Notes of million is recorded within accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of each of June 30, 2023 and 2022. Credit Agreement On February 12, 2021, Adtalem placed an million senior secured term loan Term Loan B into the loan market to provide future funding for the Walden acquisition. For beginning on March 15, 2021, Adtalem began accruing ticking fees at of the applicable margin. Beginning on April 14, 2021 and until the closing date of the Term Loan B, Adtalem accrued ticking fees at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of . All ticking fees were paid at the time of the Term Loan B closing date, on August 12, 2021, and were recorded within interest expense as accrued in the Consolidated Statements of Income. On August 12, 2021, Adtalem replaced the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below) by entering into its new credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for (1) a million senior secured term loan with a maturity date of August 12, 2028 and (2) a million senior secured revolving loan facility Revolver with a maturity date of August 12, 2026. We refer to the Term Loan B and Revolver collectively as the Credit Facility. The Revolver has availability for letters of credit and currencies other than U.S. dollars of up to million. Through June 30, 2023, interest on our Credit Facility was set based on LIBOR, which was based on observable market transactions. The Credit Agreement provides guidance surrounding the implementation of a replacement benchmark rate. On June 27, 2023, Adtalem entered into Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, identifying the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as the replacement benchmark rate for eurocurrency rate loans within the Credit Agreement. Beginning with the next interest rate reset in July 2023, the base rate will change to SOFR. Term Loan B Borrowings under the Term Loan B bear interest at Adtalem s option at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of , plus an applicable margin ranging from to for eurocurrency term loan borrowings or to for alternative base rate ABR borrowings depending on Adtalem s net first lien leverage ratio for such period. As of June 30, 2023, the interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan B facility was , which approximated the effective interest rate. The proceeds of the Term Loan B were used, among other things, to finance the Walden acquisition, refinance Adtalem s Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below), and pay fees and expenses related to the Walden acquisition. The Term Loan B originally required quarterly installment payments of million beginning on March 31, 2022. On March 11, 2022, we made a prepayment of million on the Term Loan B. With that prepayment, we are no longer required to make quarterly installment payments. We made additional Term Loan B prepayments of million and million on September 22, 2022 and November 22, 2022, respectively. Revolver Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of , plus an applicable margin ranging from to for LIBOR borrowings or to for ABR borrowings depending on Adtalem s net first lien leverage ratio for such period. There were borrowings under the Revolver during the year ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. The Credit Agreement requires payment of a commitment fee equal to as of June 30, 2023, of the unused portion of the Revolver. The commitment fee expense is recorded within interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount unused under the Revolver was million as of June 30, 2023.

We refer to the Prior Term Loan B and Prior Revolver collectively as the Prior Credit Facility. Prior Term Loan B For eurocurrency rate loans, Prior Term Loan B interest was equal to LIBOR or a . For base rate loans, Prior Term Loan B interest was equal to the . The Prior Term Loan B required quarterly installment payments of , with the balance due at maturity on April 13, 2025. On March 24, 2020, we executed a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreement (the Swap with a multinational financial institution to mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate on our Prior Term Loan B debt. We paid interest at a fixed rate of and received variable interest of (subject to a minimum of ), on a notional amount equal to the amount outstanding under the Prior Term Loan B. The effective date of the Swap was March 31, 2020 and settlements with the counterparty occurred on a monthly basis. The Swap was set to terminate on February 28, 2025. During the operating term of the Swap, the annual interest rate on the amount of the Prior Term Loan B was fixed at (including the impact of the interest rate margin on LIBOR loans) for the applicable interest rate period. The Swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and as such, changes in its fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income within interest expense in the periods in which the hedged transactions affected earnings. On July 29, 2021, prior to refinancing our Credit Agreement (as discussed above), we settled and terminated the Swap for million, which resulted in a charge to interest expense in the year ended June 30, 2022. Prior Revolver Prior Revolver interest was equal to LIBOR or a LIBOR-equivalent rate for eurocurrency rate loans or a base rate, plus an applicable margin based on Adtalem s consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement. The applicable margin ranged from to for eurocurrency rate loans and from to for base rate loans. Debt Discount and Issuance Costs The Term Loan B was issued at a price of of its principal amount, resulting in an original issue discount of . The debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes and Term Loan B are capitalized and presented as a direct deduction from the face amount of the debt, while the debt issuance costs related to the Revolver are classified as other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt discount and issuance costs are amortized as interest expense over for the Notes and Term Loan B and over for the Revolver. The remaining million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Prior Credit Facility and the million of debt issuances costs associated with an unused bridge facility, which was in place should the permanent financing not have been obtained, were expensed in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, based on the million prepayment on the Term Loan B and million prepayment on the Notes during fiscal year 2022, we expensed million and million, respectively, in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2022, which was the proportionate amount of the remaining unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the Term Loan B and Notes as of the prepayment dates. million prepayments on the Term Loan B during fiscal year 2023, we expensed million in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2023, which was the proportionate amount of the remaining unamortized debt discount and issuance costs related to the Term Loan B as of the prepayment date.

With the million prepayment on March 11, 2022 on the Term Loan B, the million prepayment on the Notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, and the million prepayment on September 22, 2022 on the Term Loan B, we satisfied the mandatory prepayment requirement resulting from the sale proceeds received from the sale of the Financial Services segment. other mandatory prepayments have been required since the execution of the Credit Agreement.

The twelfth share repurchase program commenced in January 2021 and expired on December 31, 2021. On March 1, 2022, we announced that the Board authorized Adtalem s thirteenth share repurchase program, which allows Adtalem to repurchase up to million of its common stock through February 25, 2025. Total cost of share repurchases Average price paid per share As of June 30, 2023, million of authorized share repurchases were remaining under the current share repurchase program. The timing and amount of any future repurchases will be determined based on an evaluation of market conditions and other factors. These repurchases may be made through the open market, including block purchases, in private negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Repurchases will be funded through available cash balances and/or borrowings and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Shares of stock repurchased under the programs are held as treasury shares. Repurchases under our share repurchase programs reduce the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations . ASR Agreement On March 14, 2022, we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase million of common stock. We received an initial delivery of shares of common stock representing approximately of the total shares expected to be delivered at the time of executing the ASR based on the per share price on the day prior to the execution date. This initial delivery of shares reduced the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. The final number of shares to be repurchased was based on the volume-weighted average price of Adtalem s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement. See Note 9 Earnings per Share for information on the ASR impact to earnings per share for fiscal year 2023. The ASR agreement ended on October 14, 2022. Based on the volume-weighted average price of Adtalem s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, Adtalem owed the counter party shares of common stock. We elected to settle the contract in cash instead of delivering shares by making a cash payment of million on November 2, 2022. On March 14, 2022, we recorded the million purchase price of the ASR as a reduction to shareholders equity, consisting of a million increase in treasury stock and a million reduction in additional paid-in capital, which represented an equity forward contract, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Under these plans, directors, key executives, and managerial employees are eligible to receive incentive or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of Adtalem s common stock and also permit the granting of stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance-based RSUs, and other stock and cash-based compensation. Although options remain outstanding under the 2005 incentive plan, no further grants will be issued under this plan. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Adtalem accounts for stock-based compensation granted to retirement eligible employees that fully vests upon an employee s retirement under the non-substantive vesting period approach. Under this approach, the entire stock-based compensation expense is recognized at the grant date for stock-based grants issued to retirement eligible employees. For non-retirement eligible employees, stock-based compensation expense is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period. We account for forfeitures of unvested awards in the period they occur. As of June 30, 2023, shares were authorized for issuance but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under Adtalem s stock-based incentive plans.

The tax benefit from options exercised for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was million, million, and million, respectively. The fair value of Adtalem s options was estimated using a binomial model. This model uses historical cancellation and exercise experience of Adtalem to determine the option value. It also considers the illiquid nature of employee options during the vesting period. The weighted-average estimated grant date fair value of options granted at market price under Adtalem s stock-based incentive plans during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was and , per share, respectively. stock options were granted during fiscal year 2023. The fair value of Adtalem s option grants was estimated assuming the following weighted-average assumptions: Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Dividend yield The expected life of the options granted is based on the weighted-average exercise life with age and salary adjustment factors from historical exercise behavior. Adtalem s expected volatility is computed by combining and weighting the implied market volatility, the most recent volatility over the expected life of the option grant, and Adtalem s long-term historical volatility. During fiscal year 2023, Adtalem granted RSUs to selected employees and directors. Of these, were performance-based RSUs and were non-performance-based RSUs. We issue performance-based RSUs generally with a cliff vest from the grant date. The final number of shares issued under performance-based RSUs is based on metrics approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Prior to fiscal year 2023, we issued non-performance-based RSUs generally with a graduated vesting from the grant date. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, we issue non-performance-based RSUs generally with a graduated vesting from the grant date. We also regularly issue RSUs to our Board members with a cliff vest from the grant date. The recipient of the non-performance-based RSUs has the right to receive dividend equivalents, if any. This right does not pertain to the performance-based RSUs.

Total liabilities under the NDCP plan included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 were million and million, respectively. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the liabilities under the NDCP plan is included in student services and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We have elected to fund our NDCP plan obligations through a rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. Amounts in the rabbi trust are placed in investments whose performance is generally consistent with the investments chosen by participants under their NDCP plan accounts, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value.

The mortgage was due on as a balloon payment and bore interest at a rate of per annum, payable monthly. The carrying value of the DePaul College Prep loan receivable, which approximates its fair value, is included in other assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 was million. Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using an average of current rates for similar arrangements, which was estimated at per annum and was classified as Level 2. On February 23, 2023, DePaul College Prep paid the mortgage in full, which resulted in derecognition of the note receivable from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adtalem has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for highly compensated employees and its Board members. The participant s investments are in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator. Changes in the fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units. Total liabilities under the plan included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 were million and million, respectively. The fair value of the nonqualified deferred compensation obligation is classified as Level 2 because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments.

See Note 14 Debt for additional information on our long-term debt agreements. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs. We recorded an impairment of million on an equity investment with no readily determinable fair value within other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year ended June 30, 2023 as the carrying value is no longer recoverable. Since initial recognition of the investment, there have been no upward or downward adjustments as a result of observable price changes. Following the impairment, the carrying amount of million was reduced to . Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets arising from a business combination. These assets are not amortized and charged to expense over time. Instead, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment. This impairment review was most recently completed as of May 31, 2023.

Adtalem management determined a loss contingency was probable and reasonably estimable. As such, we also recorded a loss contingency accrual of million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020 and charged the contingency loss within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the year ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we had anticipated the potential payments related to this loss contingency to be made from the escrow account during fiscal year 2021.

Exhibit 4(a) DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK The following summarizes certain provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of Adtalem Global Education Inc. Adtalem or the Company (the Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company, dated as of November 10, 2021 (the By-Laws ). Such summaries do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws, including the definitions therein of certain terms. Copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws are filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Adtalem Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023. GENERAL The Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200 million shares of common stock, 0.01 par value Common Stock ). As of August 4, 2023, there were approximately 41.5 million shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and approximately 5.0 million shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated Incentive Plan of 2005 and the Fourth Amended and Restated Incentive Plan of 2013. COMMON STOCK The shares of Common Stock have no preemptive or other subscription rights and are not subject to any future call or assessment. The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol ATGE. Holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors (the Board out of funds legally available therefor. Adtalem is dependent on the earnings of its subsidiaries for funds to pay cash dividends. Cash flow from Adtalem s subsidiaries may be restricted by law. Cash flow also is subject to certain restrictions by covenants in Adtalem s credit facility, including maintaining fixed charge coverage and leverage at or above specified levels. On February 16, 2017, the Board determined to discontinue cash dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Any future payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent on projections of future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements of Adtalem and other factors as the Board deems relevant. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment in full of liabilities. There are no redemption, conversion or sinking fund provisions with respect to the Common Stock. The holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter submitted to stockholders. The availability for issue of shares of Common Stock by the Company without any further action by stockholders (except as may be required by applicable NYSE regulations) could be viewed as enabling the Board to make more difficult a change in control of the Company, including by issuing warrants or rights to acquire shares of Common Stock to discourage or defeat unsolicited stock accumulation programs and acquisition proposals and by issuing shares in a private placement or public offering to dilute or deter stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of the Company. TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR The transfer agent and registrar for the Common Stock is Computershare Investor Services, LLC, in Canton, Massachusetts. ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTS OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company contain certain provisions that may make the acquisition of control of the Company by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, a proxy fight or otherwise more difficult. These provisions are designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with the Company s Board. The Company believes that, as a general rule, the interest of its stockholders would be served best if any change in control results from negotiations with its Board based upon careful consideration of the proposed terms, 
 1 

 such as the price to be paid to stockholders, the form of consideration to be paid and the anticipated tax effects of the transaction. However, the provisions could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price for the shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of the Company s stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide. Set forth below is a description of the relevant provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws. The descriptions are intended as a summary only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws which are filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Adtalem Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023. Board of Directors . The Certificate of Incorporation provides that all directors shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of directors will not be less than three nor more than 13 and that the directors will have the power to set the exact number of directors within that range from time to time by resolution adopted by vote of a majority of the entire Board. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any director, or the entire Board, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, voting together as a class, given at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders. No Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings . The Certificate of Incorporation provides that stockholder action can be taken only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by a majority of the entire Board, the Chairman of the Board or the President. Stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting or to require the Board to call a special meeting of stockholders. Any call for a special meeting must specify the matters to be acted upon at the meeting, unless otherwise provided by law. Other Constituencies . The Certificate of Incorporation provides that, in determining whether to take or refrain from taking any corporate action, the Board may take into account long-term as well as short-term interests of the Company and its stockholders, customers, employees, students, graduates, faculty and other constituencies of the Company, including the effect on communities in which the Company does business. Stockholder Proposals . The By-Laws provide that, if a stockholder desires to submit a proposal at an annual or special stockholders meeting or to nominate persons for election as directors, the stockholder must submit written notice to the Company not later than (i) with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, and (ii) with respect to a special meeting of stockholders duly called for the election of directors, the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first sent or given to stockholders. The notice must describe the proposal or nomination and set forth the name and address of, and stock held of record and beneficially by, the stockholder. Notices of stockholders proposals must set forth reasons for conducting such business and any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Director nomination notices must set forth the name and address of the nominee, arrangements between the stockholder and the nominee and other information as would be required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge a proposal or nomination not made in compliance with the procedures contained in the By-Laws. In addition to candidates submitted through the advance notice By-Law process for stockholder nominations, stockholders may also request that a director nominee be included in Adtalem s proxy materials in accordance with the proxy access provision in the By-Laws. Any stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders holding both investment and voting rights to at least 3 of Adtalem s outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20 of the Adtalem directors to be elected at an annual meeting of stockholders. Such requests must be received not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders.

 Except as may otherwise be required by law or permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Company s shares are listed and traded, any question brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the Company s capital stock represented and entitled to vote on such question at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, voting as a single class. Directors of the Company in a contested election (i.e., where the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected) shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the Company s capital stock represented and entitled to vote in the election of directors at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present. However, in an uncontested election (i.e., where the number of nominees for director is the same as the number of directors to be elected), directors shall be elected by the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the Company s capital stock represented and entitled to vote in the election of directors at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present. In the event that a nominee for re-election as a director fails to receive the requisite majority vote at an annual or special meeting held for the purpose of electing directors where the election is uncontested, such director must, promptly following certification of the stockholder vote, tender his or her resignation to the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, or such other group of independent members of the Board as is determined by the entire Board (excluding the director who tendered the resignation) will evaluate any such resignation in light of the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and will make a recommendation to the entire Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. In reaching its decision, the Board may consider any factors it deems relevant, including the director s qualifications, the director s past and expected future contributions to the Company, the overall composition of the Board and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the Company to fail to meet any applicable law, rule or regulation (including the listing requirements of any securities exchange). The Board shall complete this process within 90 days after the certification of the stockholder vote and shall report its decision to the stockholders in the Company s filing following such Board decision.

 (b) During the Restricted Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, in any manner: (i) hire or engage, or recruit, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or retain any individual who is or was an employee of or consultant to Adtalem or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive s employment, (ii) induce or attempt to induce any individual who is or was an employee of, or consultant to, Adtalem or its Affiliates within the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the termination of Executive s employment, to leave the employ of Adtalem or the relevant Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the relationship between Adtalem or its Affiliates and any of their employees or consultants, or (iii) recommend the hiring of, or provide a reference for any individual who was an employee of or consultant to Adtalem or its Affiliates (provided, however that the Executive may hire former employees and individual consultants to Adtalem and its Affiliates after such former employees or individual consultants have ceased to be employed or otherwise engaged by Adtalem or its Affiliates for a period of at least twelve (12) months). 
 
 (c) During the Restricted Period, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly: (i) call on, solicit or service any Customer with the intent of selling or attempting to sell any service or product similar to, or competitive with, the services or products sold by Adtalem or its Affiliates as of the date of the termination of Executive s employment, or (ii) in any way interfere with the relationship between Adtalem, its Affiliates and any Customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation (or any prospective Customer, supplier, licensee or other business relationship) of Adtalem or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, by making any negative or disparaging statements or communications regarding Adtalem, its Affiliates or any of their operations, officers, directors or investors).

 (d) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Section 13 with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of Adtalem and its Affiliates. In particular, the Executive agrees and acknowledges that Adtalem is currently engaging in Business and actively marketing its services and products throughout the Restricted Area, that Executive s duties and responsibilities for Adtalem and/or its Affiliates are co-extensive with the entire scope of Adtalem s Business, that Adtalem has spent significant time and effort developing and protecting the confidentiality of its methods of doing business, technology, customer lists, long term customer relationships and trade secrets and that such methods, technology, customer lists, customer relationships and trade secrets have significant value. However, if, 

at the time of enforcement of this Section 13, a court holds that the duration, geographical area or scope of activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing or impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of Adtalem and its Affiliates, the Parties agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law, in all cases giving effect to the intent of the parties that the restrictions contained herein be given effect to the broadest extent possible. The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive against Adtalem, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Adtalem of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, which Sections will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of any breach by Adtalem. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be prohibited from pursuing such claims or causes of action against Adtalem. The Executive consents to Adtalem notifying any future employer of the Executive of the Executive s obligations under Sections 10, 11, 12 and this Section 13 of this Agreement. 
 
 (e) In the event of the breach or a threatened breach by the Executive of any of the provisions of Sections 10, 11, 12 or this Section 13, Adtalem, in addition and supplementary to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, will be entitled to seek specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief (in the form of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction) from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof. 
 
 (f) Upon the Executive s written request, the CEO may, in the CEO s sole discretion, permit the Executive to engage in certain work or activity that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, if and only if the Executive first provides the CEO with written evidence satisfactory to the CEO, including assurances from any new employer of the Executive, that the contribution of Executive s knowledge to that work or activity will not cause the Executive to disclose, base judgment upon, or use Adtalem s trade secrets or other Confidential Information. The Executive shall not engage in such work or activity unless and until the Executive receives written consent from the CEO. 
 (g) Neither the CEO s consent under Section 13(f) nor Adtalem s failure to seek enforcement of any restrictive covenant under this Agreement shall be deemed a consent or waiver by Adtalem of any subsequent breach of this Agreement by the Executive and Adtalem shall have the right to seek enforcement of this Agreement against the Executive for any breach not specifically consented to in writing by the CEO or Adtalem.
