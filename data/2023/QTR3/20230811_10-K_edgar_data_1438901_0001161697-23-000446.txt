Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. formerly The 4Less Group,
Inc. is referred to hereinafter as we , our , or us. 

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Company 

Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. formerly The 4LESS Group,
Inc., also previously known as MedCareers Group, Inc. (the Company , MCGI ), was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada on December 5, 2007. The Company formally operated a website for nurses, nursing schools and nurses 
organizations designed for better communication between nurses and the nursing profession. 

On November 29, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction
(the Share Exchange ), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100 of the issued and outstanding equity securities of The
4LESS Corp. 4LESS ), in exchange for the issuance of (i) nineteen thousand (19,000) shares of Series B Preferred Stock,
(ii) six thousand seven hundred fifty (6,750) shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (iii) 870 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The
Series C Preferred Shares have a right to convert, and was converted in December 2021 into common stock of the Company by multiplying
the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock by 2.63 on the conversion date. The Share Exchange closed on November 29,
2018. As a result of the Share Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share
Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer
for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial
statements for the period prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued
as a result of the reverse merger except otherwise noted. 

4Less was formed as Vegas Suspension Offroad,
LLC on October 24, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation with the same name on May 8, 2017.
On April 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to The 4Less Corp. The Corporation had S Corporation status. The Corporation operated as
an e-commerce auto and truck parts sales company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company became a holding company operating through
4Less and offers products including exhaust systems, suspension systems, wheels, tires, stereo systems, truck bed covers, and shocks. 

In early 2020, the company began developing AutoParts4Less.com
as a multi-seller enterprise-level marketplace dedicated to consolidating the 500 billion annual aftermarket automotive parts industry,
including cars, trucks, boats, motorcycles, and RVs, on a single platform. The company officially launched AutoParts4Less.com with around
2 million parts from over 25 parts sellers in November 2022. Later in the month of November 2022
the company made the decision to discontinue LiftKits4Less.com operations.

Table of Contents 

Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. formerly The 4LESS Group,
Inc. 4Less , the Company , we or us ), the Company described
herein, is a Nevada corporation, with offices located at 106 W Mayflower, Las Vegas, NV 89030. It can be reached by phone at (702) 267-6100. 

History 

The Company was formed as RX Scripted, LLC on December
30, 2004 as a North Carolina limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation as RX Scripted, Inc. on December 5, 2007. 

On or around January 7, 2010 the Company s name
was changed to MedCareers Group, Inc. Additionally, as a result of filing the Certificate, the Company s symbol on the Over-The-Counter
Bulletin Board changed to MCGI , effective January 7, 2010. 

On or around November 19, 2010, the Company entered
into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange with Nurses Lounge, Inc., a Texas corporation Nurses Lounge and the nine shareholders of Nurses Lounge (the Nurses Lounge Shareholders ). Pursuant to the Exchange, we agreed
to issue 24,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to the Nurses Lounge Shareholders in exchange for 100 of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of Nurses Lounge. Although 24,000,000 restricted shares were issued in connection with the Exchange, certain
significant shareholders of the Company also agreed to cancel some of the shares they owned so that the net effect of the Exchange was
an increase to the outstanding shares by 7,175,000 shares rather than 24,000,000. Included in the shareholders receiving shares
in connection with the Exchange, was Timothy Armes founder and president of Nurses Lounge, Inc., who received 14,902,795 shares. In December
2019 Nurses Lounge was disposed of as more fully described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the Notes to the Financial Statements. 

Auto Parts 4Less 

Like many small businesses, Christopher Davenport,
the founder of Auto Parts 4Less 4Less previously named The 4less Corp., the wholly owned subsidiary of Auto Parts 4Less
Group, Inc., began selling auto parts on eBay and shipping those items out of his garage in 2013. What started out as a hobby, quickly
grew into a fully functioning ecommerce aftermarket auto parts company that required a significant technical staff and facilities to support
their growth. In June of 2015, they leased their first office. 

Originally the company listed their auto parts in
the different marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Jet. Starting in 2016 the company began investing to become their own
ecommerce platform thereby allowing their auto parts to be direct listed across marketplace and social media sites. Technical achievements
including CRM system, warehouse integration API, warehouse inventory software to name a few. 

In 2019, shortly after the share exchange with MedCareers
Group, Inc., with technology upgrades in place, 4Less began successfully moving majority of sales from third party marketplaces direct
to their proprietary ecommerce web site Liftkits4Less.com. By doing so the company saves 8 -10 in fees charged by the major marketplace s
such as e-Bay and Amazon as well as further building the 4less brand as a leading ecommerce site for auto parts. 

On November 19, 2019 the Company acquired the URL
Autoparts4Less.com and changed the name of their wholly owned subsidiary from the 4Less Corp. to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc. With the acquisition
of the URL AutoParts4Less.com, the Company also began focusing all of their efforts and resources on building out a flagship automotive
marketplace with the potential to offer buyers a wide range of automotive parts for cars, trucks,
boats, motorcycles and RV s on a single platform. 

In August 2021
the Company launched a beta test version of Autoparts4less.com. In a short period of time after the beta launch the company realized that
with the amount of interest received from numerous types of large sellers, which included not only ecommerce sites presently selling
parts online, but also interest from other large parts sellers such as warehouse distributors, new car dealers with large inventories
of parts as well as brick and mortar parts retailers looking to move sales online, the platform originally created would soon be inadequate.
As such, the Company made the decision to upgrade to a larger and more advanced platform solution so they immediately began implementation
of the AWS Fargate serverless platform solution. 

The platform
upgrade was completed and the Autoparts4less.com marketplace was officially launched in early November 2022. Later in the month of November
2022 the company made the decision to discontinue LiftKits4Less.com operations. By doing so the company no longer needs to carry parts
inventory and maintain warehouse space thus greatly reducing the monthly operating costs in the process. 

On April 28.
2022 the Company changed its name from The 4LESS Group, Inc. to Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc.

Competition 

We directly compete for buyers to use our web sites
over current e-commerce sites as well as sellers that utilize major marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. However, we believe our
specialty ecommerce website liftkits4less.com offers substantial value-added content including installation guides, install videos, high
impact photos, order customization and live chat with a technical expert. 

Additionally, we believe that our automotive parts
marketplace AutoParts4less.com, with no known large challengers presently in the space outside of all things to all people 
online marketplaces Amazon and eBay, has the opportunity to quickly be branded when launched as the auto part s industry premier
marketplace just as sites like Etsy, Wayfair, Uber and Chewey s have been able to successfully do in their industries. 

Employees 

As of August 9, 2023, we had 2 employees, 2 of which
were full-time. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K

as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).

 Total Revenue 

4,202,880 

11,018,751 

(6,815,871) 
 (62) 

We had total revenue of 4,202,880 for the year ended
January 31, 2023, compared to 11,018,751 for the year ended January 31, 2022. Revenue decreased by 6,815,871 or 62 . This large decrease
can be attributed to the Company winding down it s online store activities during to be replaced by the online marketplace autoparts4less.com.
In it s previous business model the company operated as a traditional online store, carrying inventories, fulfilling orders as well
as sales and marketing costs. The Company s revenues going forward will be based on transactional charges earned within the marketplace.
As autoparts4less.com grows, we presently have eighty vendors, and expect to be shortly at 100 vendors, and during the next fiscal year
will become the Company s primary focus and revenue generator .The Company at January 31, 2021 had 66,153 (2022- 665,143) of deferred
revenue which represents orders received before January 31, 2023 but delivered after. This will be revenue that the Company recognizes
in the first quarter ended April 30, 2023. Also, the Company had 38,448 (2022- 530,900) in customer deposits which represents
orders received before January 31, 2023 but either cancelled or still unfulfilled after. For the prior year ended January 31, 2022, both
deferred revenues and deposits were a result of inventory shortages and supplier back-order issues as well as normal order fulfillment
delays. 

Gross Profit 

We had gross profit of 740,443 for the year ended
January 31, 2023, compared to gross profit of 1,547,447 for the year ended January 31, 2022. Gross profit decreased by 807,004, a 52 
reduction, yet gross profit increased to 18 in fiscal 2023 from 14 in fiscal 2022. 

- 19 - 

Table of Contents 

Gross profit decreased because of the 62 decrease
in sales. This was partially offset by the increase in gross profit which was because of the remaining pandemic issues in fiscal 2022
relating to cost of revenue where the Company had to purchase goods at higher product costs from distributers rather than the usual manufacturers
for many of the new available products or some of the products that were not available from the usual manufacturers due to supply chain
issues. In fiscal 2023 the Company focused more on available products that were more profitable.

Depreciation increased by
 2,075 as there were only 1,142 in asset additions in fiscal 2023 so there was no significant change in depreciation expense. 

Postage shipping and freight
decreased by 365,622 due to 62 decrease in sales. 

Marketing and advertising
decreased by 1,713,018 due to only minimal advertising done in anticipation of soon transitioning revenues to autoparts4less.com marketplace. 

E Commerce Services, Commissions
and Fees decreased by 320,170 with 444,026 due to decreased sales offset by an increase of approximately 124,000 on the new marketplace
website. 

Personnel Costs decreased
by 864,382 due to staff reductions as a result of lower volumes due to the business transition. The President of the subsidiary, Autoparts4less
Inc. reduced his salary in fiscal 2023 by approximately 611,000 to 2,071. 

General and Administrative
increased by 171,629. This increase is attributed to a non cash increase charge of 596,945 to stock based compensation. The 1,998,000
charge on 250,000 options issued to the CEO (which replaced 50,000 options previously issued and now cancelled) was offset by fees to
consultants paid in warrants and shares that were charged and issued in the prior year. This increase was offset by the following changes:
 312,484 decrease in professional fees (which comprise of accounting, legal, reporting and transfer agent costs), and 182,190 decrease
in investor relations. Reporting and investor relations charges decreased to S-1 and shares issuances done in the prior year.

The results of the year ended January 31, 2023 resulted
in other expense of 12,404,608 vs other expense of 611,764 for the year ended January 31, 2022. For the year ended January 31, 2023
the Company acquired approximately 6 million in short term convertible debt which resulted in higher interest costs and debt amortization.
The convertible debt also included added warrants and shares which increased the discount and resultant amortization as well. Penalty
interest of 3,782,814 was charged in the year ending January 31, 2023 compared with 28,000 charged the prior year. 

We had net loss of 17,784,525 for the year ended
January 31, 2023, compared to net loss of 8,069,756 for the year ended January 31, 2022 due mainly, the higher interest and debt amortization,
the lower gain on settlement of debt, increased share based compensation and the other factors mentioned above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of January 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents
of 4,737 of cash, 50,000 of inventory and total current liabilities of 20,768,832. We had negative working capital of 20,671,087 as
of January 31, 2023. 

Net cash used in operations for the year ended
January 31, 2023 was 3,837,380 compared to 6,340,468 for the year ended January 31, 2022. The use of cash in operations was caused
by the net loss offset by non-cash adjustments. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
year ended January 31, 2023 was 1,142 compared to 18,568 for the year ended January 31, 2022. In both years net cash used in
investing activities was for fixed asset additions. 

Cash provided by financing activities for the year
ended January 31, 2023 was 3,765,761 compared to 6,158,870 for the year ended January 31, 2022. For the year ended January 31, 2023
cash provided from financing activities was from the proceeds from convertible notes payable. For the prior year, cash provided from financing
activities was from the net proceeds from the issuance of common shares and the proceeds from convertible notes payable. 

Subsequent to year end, through the date of
filing of this Form 10-K, the company issued loans totaling 204,500 for cash proceeds of 75,800. In addition the Company amended
an existing loan with a lender increasing the loan by 233,502 and receiving additional proceeds of 192,652. In addition as part of
these amendments, the company issued 100,000 shares of common stock, warrants to acquire 97,221 shares with a 5 year term and a
 1.00 exercise price and additional warrants to acquire 1,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of 0.00001 and
matures upon issuance of these share. The maturity date was amended to July 5, 2023. 

We borrowed funds and/or sold stock for working capital.
 These transactions are detailed in the section Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities . 

Currently, we don t have sufficient cash reserves
to meet its contractual obligations and its ongoing monthly expenses, which we anticipate totaling approximately 6,000,000 over the next
12 months. Historically, revenues have not been sufficient to cover operating costs that would permit us to continue as a going
concern. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have been able to continue operating
to date largely from loans made by its shareholders, other debt financings and sale of common stock. We are currently looking at
both short-term and more permanent financing opportunities, including debt or equity funding, bridge or short-term loans, and/or traditional
bank funding, but we have not decided on any specific path moving forward. Until we have raised sufficient funding to pay our ongoing
expenses associated with being a public company, and we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations, we can provide no assurances
that it will be able to meet its short and long-term liquidity needs, until necessary financing is secured. 

We do not currently have any additional formal commitments
or identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from our officers, director or significant shareholders. We can provide
no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are not able to raise the capital necessary
to continue our business operations, we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business plan. 

In the future, we may be required to seek additional
capital by selling additional debt or equity securities, selling assets, if any, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance
when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution
to our then shareholders. We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers . The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue when control
is transferred over the promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable
that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer.
The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: 

Step 1: Identify the contract with the
customer 

 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations
in the contract 

 Step 3: Determine the transaction price 

 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations in the contract 

 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the company
satisfies a performance obligation 

Because the Company s sales agreements generally
have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose
information about its remaining performance obligations. 

Disaggregation of Revenue: Channel Revenue

and third party website revenue for the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:

 (62) 

The Company s performance obligations are satisfied
at the point in time when products are received by the customer, which is when the customer has title and obtained the significant risks
and rewards of ownership. Therefore, the Company s contracts have a single performance obligation (shipment of product). The Company
primarily receives fixed consideration for sales of product. Shipping and handling amounts paid by customers are primarily for online
orders and are included in revenue. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. 

Revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts
and promotion allowances, which are typically agreed to upfront with the customer and do not represent variable consideration. Discounts
and promotional allowances vary the consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for the sale of products to customers. The Company
recognizes these discounts and promotional allowances in the same period that the revenue is recognized for products sales to customers.
The amount of revenue recognized represents the amount that will not be subject to a significant future reversal of revenue. The customer
pays the Company by credit card prior to delivery. 

The Company offers a 30 day satisfaction guaranteed
return policy however the customer must pay for the return shipment. The return must be previously authorized, cannot be either damaged
or previously installed and must be in saleable condition. In the Company s experience this amount is immaterial and therefore no
provision has been recorded on the Company s books. Any defective merchandise falls under the manufacturer s limited warranty
and is subject to the manufacturer s inspection. The manufacturer has the option to repair or replace the item. 

All sales to customers are generally final. However,
the Company accepts returned product due to quality or issues relating to product description or incorrect product orders and in such
instances the Company would replace the product or refund the customers funds The Company s customers generally pre-pay for the
products.

Table of Contents 

Use of Estimates 

In order to prepare financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and determine whether contingent assets and liabilities, if any, are disclosed in the
financial statements. The ultimate resolution of issues requiring these estimates and assumptions could differ significantly from resolution
currently anticipated by management and on which the financial statements are based. The most significant estimates included in
these consolidated financial statements are those associated with the assumptions used to estimate deferred revenue and customer deposits
and value derivative liabilities. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company s financial instruments consist
of cash, accounts payable, advances and notes payable. The Company considers the carrying value of such amounts in the financial
statements to approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Derivatives are recorded at fair
value at each period end. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. 

The ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level 1 Inputs Quoted prices for
identical instruments in active markets. 

Level 2 Inputs Quoted prices for
similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 

Level 3 Inputs Instruments with
primarily unobservable value drivers. 

As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company s
derivative liabilities were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs. See Note 8. 

The following table sets forth, by level within the
fair value hierarchy, the Company s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of January
31, 2023:

Derivative Liability 

The derivative liabilities are valued as a level 3
input under the fair value hierarchy for valuing financial instruments. The derivatives arise from convertible debt where the debt and
accrued interest is convertible into common stock at variable conversion prices. As the price of the common stock varies, it triggers
a gain or loss based upon the discount to market assuming the debt was converted at the balance sheet date. When evaluating the effect
of the issuance of new equity-linked or equity-settled instruments on previously issued instruments, the Company uses first-in, first-out
method FIFO where authorized and unused shares would first be used to satisfy the earliest issued equity-linked instruments.
As of January 31, 2023, the Company had warrants to purchase 1,609,728 common shares and stock options to purchase 250,000 common shares.

Table of Contents 

The fair value of the derivative liability is determined
using a lattice model, is re-measured on the Company s reporting dates, and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including
our stock price, historical stock price volatility, the expected term, and both high risk and the risk-free interest rate. The most sensitive
inputs to the model are for expected time for the holder to convert or be repaid and the estimated historical volatility of the Company s
common stock. However, because the historical volatility of the Company s common stock is so high, the sensitivity required
to change the liability by 1 as of January 31, 2023 is greater than 25 change in historical volatility as of that date. The other
inputs, such as risk free rate, high yield cash rate and stock price all have a sensitivity for a 1 change in the input variable results
in a significantly less than 1 change in the calculated derivative liability.

Evaluation of Disclosure on Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
January 31, 2023. This evaluation was accomplished under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) who concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal
Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

We have identified the following material weaknesses
and significant deficiencies: 

Material weaknesses 

The failure of the Company to adequately invest the resources necessary to properly account for and report upon its financial position and results of operations under the requirements of US GAAP. 

The Company filed its third quarter October 31, 2022 10-Q and its annual January 31, 2023 10-K late. 

In order to remedy our existing internal control deficiencies,
as our finances allow, we will hire additional accounting staff. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework) at January 31, 2023.
Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that, as of January 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not
effective because of limited staff and a need for a full time chief financial officer and the identification of the material weaknesses
described above. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to the attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit
the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Christopher Davenport : Mr. Davenport
received his MBA from the University of California in September 2005 where he was recognized by his classmates as the Most Innovative
Thinker . Before founding The 4Less Corp, Mr. Davenports previous business provided mobile dental services to the employees
of the largest gaming corporations in the world. These contracts covered the lives of several hundred thousand employees on the
Las Vegas strip. Due to the nature of the mobile facilities, Mr. Davenport implemented several new technologies at the time such
as: filmless radiography, virtual patient charts and VPN networks to make for seamless quality health care. Soon after, Mr. Davenport
expanded his mobile dental company to the military where he won several multiyear, multi-million dollars medical/dental National Guard
Medical Readiness contracts. Mr. Davenport has a proven history of implementing innovative technologies that demonstrates his ability
to lead The 4Less Corp into the future. Mr. Davenport was appointed sole director and Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. on May 19, 2023. 

Timothy Armes : Mr. Armes has served
as President and Chief Executive Officer of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. (formerly The 4Less Group, Inc. and MedCareers Group, Inc.) since
August 2011. From February 2011 to August 2011, Mr. Armes served as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Since August
2011, Mr. Armes has served as the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. In 1992 Mr. Armes
launched one of the first online job bulletin boards which eventually grew into jobs.com. As CEO of Jobs.com he raised over 100 million
dollars and grew it into one of the top employment web sites before leaving the company in May of 2000. Mr. Armes began his career as
an auditor for Ernst and Young and then as a real estate workout specialist with different firms in the mid 1980 s. Mr. Armes obtained
a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Accounting from the University of Texas in 1980 and passed the Certified Public Accountant
exam. 

Corporate Governance 

We promote accountability for adherence to honest
and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives
to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, our Board of Directors
(currently consisting solely of Timothy Armes), is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside
auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of our financial statements and other services provided by
our independent public accountants. The Board of Directors reviews our internal accounting controls, practices and policies. 

Committees of the Board 

We do not currently does not have nominating, compensation,
or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter.
The Board of Directors believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the functions of such committees
can be adequately performed by the sole director.

Table of Contents 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not
have an independent board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation
S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule
14A under the Exchange Act. 

We believe that our sole director is capable of analyzing
and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The sole director
does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the functions of an audit committee
can be adequately performed by the sole director. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as
an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our sole director and our executive officer has not
been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 

2. 
 any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 

3. 
 being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or 

4. 
 being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The Board
of Directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated by a
small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate
ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a
formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder Proposals 

We do have any defined policy or procedural requirements
for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The sole director believes that, given the stage of our development,
a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level.
We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any
specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management
or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board
of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our Chief Executive Officer, at the address appearing on the first
page of this report. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Under U.S. securities laws, directors, certain
officers and persons holding more than 10 of our common stock must report their initial ownership of our common stock and any
changes in their ownership to the SEC. The SEC has designated specific due dates for these reports and we must identify in this
Annual Report those persons who did not file these reports when due. Based solely on our review of copies of the reports filed with
the SEC and the written representations of our directors and executive officers, we believe that no director or an executive officer
or holder of more than 10 of our common stock has met the reporting requirements and filed such reports with the SEC.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence. 

As a result of the acquisition of the 4Less Corp in
November 2018 and disposition of Nurses Lounge in December of 2018, Mr. Armes canceled 100 million shares (1,666 post split) of his approximate
129,628,000 common shares he owned (2,160 post split). Along with the cancellation of his common stock and a verbal agreement to stay
on as our President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Armes received 120 shares of Series D Preferred stock, maintained his 1,000 shares
of Series B Preferred stock, received 100 Class C preferred shares (during the year ended January 31, 2021) and a payable to Mr. Armes
representing 180,000 of deferred income of which a balance of 46,173 remains payable at January 31, 2022. On February 1, 2022, Mr. Armes
converted his 100 Class C preferred shares for 12,484 common shares. 

As part of the acquisition of The 4Less Corp., Christopher
Davenport, the founder and president of The 4Less Corp, received 17,100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock representing approximately
89 of the 20,000 Series B Preferred stock outstanding, 6,075 shares of Series C Preferred stock outstanding which can be converted into
approximately 60 of our outstanding common stock and 675 shares of Series D Preferred stock. On February 1, 2022, Mr. Davenport converted his 6075 Class C preferred shares for 758,420 common shares. 

Review, Approval and Ratification of Related Party
Transactions 

Given our small size and limited financial resources,
we had not adopted formal policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of transactions, such as those described above,
with our executive officers, director(s) and significant stockholders. However, we make it a practice of having our Board of Directors
(currently consisting solely of Mr. Armes) approve and ratify all related party transactions. In connection with such approval and ratification,
our Board of Directors takes into account several factors, including their fiduciary duties to us; the relationships of the related parties
to us; the material facts underlying each transaction; the anticipated benefits to us and related costs associated with such benefits;
whether comparable products or services are available; and the terms we could receive from an unrelated third party. 

- 30 - 

Table of Contents 

We intend to establish formal policies and procedures
in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed additional directors, so that such transactions will be subject to
the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee thereof. On a moving forward basis, the Board
of Directors will continue to approve any related party transaction based on the criteria set forth above. 

Director Independence 

We currently only have one director, Christopher Davenport
, who is not independent.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the 

 Board of Directors of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Auto Parts 4Less Group, Inc. (the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements
of loss from operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two years ended January 31, 2023, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the two years ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully explained in Note 2, which includes management s
plans in regards to this uncertainty, the Company has a negative working capital of approximately 20.7 million and an accumulated deficit
of approximately 46.2 million and stockholders deficit of approximately 21.4 million as of the year ended January 31, 2023,
and therefore there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
Audit Committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Critical Audit Matter Description Embedded
Conversion Feature 

The Company has numerous notes payable from prior
years and several new notes and warrants in the current year with conversions or exercise features that resulted in derivatives. This
and other factors require the embedded conversion feature to be bifurcated and the fair value of the feature to be remeasured at each
reporting period. Calculations and accounting for the notes payable and warrants and exercise features require management s
judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition of the debt and related conversions features, exercise rights use of a valuation
model, and determination of the appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. 

F-1 

Index to Financial Statements 

Critical Audit Matter Determination 

The embedded conversion features, warrants, and resulting
derivative liability is a highly complex area of accounting with significant impact on the liabilities, additional paid in capital and
statement of operations of the Company. It takes a high degree of training to understand and recognize the accounting implications
of the conversion features and exercise rights and to understand the assumptions and impact of the specific assumptions on the valuation
model used in the calculation of the derivative liability. 

Critical Audit Matter Audit Procedures 

Our audit procedures related to evaluating the Company s
accounting for the convertible note payables with embedded derivatives, warrants issued with the debt, accrued interest and the related
derivative liability were as follows: 

- 
 We read the various instruments, identified the embedded conversion feature, confirmed the amount of the outstanding debt, and recalculated the accrued interest. 

- 
 We assessed the credentials and reputation of the outside firm retained by the Company who performed the calculation of the derivative liabilities. 

- 
 We reviewed the assumptions used to calculate the derivative liabilities at the balance sheet date and various conversion and settlement dates and the related accounting entries. 

- 
 We performed independent calculations on a test basis of specific derivatives to evaluate the model used in calculating the derivatives at various measurement dates. 

Critical Audit Matter Relevant Financial Statement
Disclosures 

- 
 We read the Company s disclosures related to the derivative liabilities and changes during the year as a result of mark to market, conversion of debt and settlement of debt activity to ensure the changes were properly accounted for and fully disclosed in the financial statements. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

. The Company, under the name MedCareers Group, Inc. MCGI formally operated a website for nurses,
nursing schools and nurses organizations designed for better communication between nurses and the nursing profession. 

On November 29, 2018, The Share Exchange closed on November 29, 2018. As a result of the Share
Exchange, the former shareholders of 4LESS became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Share Exchange was accounted for as
a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein 4LESS is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial
reporting purposes. The capital, share price, and earnings per share amount in these consolidated financial statements for the period
prior to the reverse merger were restated to reflect the recapitalization in accordance with the shares issued as a result of the reverse
merger except otherwise noted. 

4LESS was formed as Vegas Suspension Offroad,
LLC on October 24, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company and converted to a Nevada corporation with the same name on May 8, 2017.
On April 2, 2018, the Company changed its name to The 4LESS Corp. The Corporation had S Corporation status. The Corporation operates as
an e-commerce auto and truck parts sales company. As a result of the share exchange, the Company is now a holding company operating through
4LESS and offers products including exhaust systems, suspension systems, wheels, tires, stereo systems, truck bed covers, and shocks through
their web site LiftKits4Less.com. On December 30, 2019 4LESS changed its name to Auto Parts 4Less, Inc. On April 28, 2022 The 4Less Group
, Inc changed its name to Auto Parts 4less Group, Inc. 

Additionally, in early 2020, the company began developing their web site,
AutoParts4Less.com, as a multi-seller enterprise-level marketplace dedicated to consolidating the 500 billion annual aftermarket automotive
parts industry, including cars, trucks, boats, motorcycles, and RVs, on a single platform. AutoParts4Less.com officially launched with
approximately 2 million parts from over 25 parts sellers in November 2022. With the launch of their automotive marketplace the company
discontinued the operations of Liftkits4Less.com in order to substantially reduce their fixed monthly operating cost.

The Company s performance obligations are satisfied
at the point in time when products are received by the customer, which is when the customer has title and obtained the significant risks
and rewards of ownership. Therefore, the Company s contracts have a single performance obligation (delivery of product). The Company
primarily receives fixed consideration for sales of product with variability entering into consideration due to returns on shipped products.
Shipping and handling amounts paid by customers are primarily for online orders and are included in revenue. Sales tax and other similar
taxes are excluded from revenue. 

Revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts
and promotion allowances, which are typically agreed to upfront with the customer and do not represent variable consideration. Discounts
and promotional allowances vary the consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for the sale of products to customers. The Company
recognizes these discounts and promotional allowances in the same period that the revenue is recognized for products sales to customers.
The amount of revenue recognized represents the amount that will not be subject to a significant future reversal of revenue. The customer
pays the Company by credit card prior to delivery. 

Prior to the discontinuance of LiftKits4Less the Company
offered a 30 day satisfaction guaranteed return policy however the customer must pay for the return shipment. The return must be previously
authorized, cannot be either damaged or previously installed and must be in saleable condition. In the Company s experience this
amount is immaterial and therefore no provision has been recorded on the Company s books. Any defective merchandise falls under
the manufacturer s limited warranty and is subject to the manufacturer s inspection. The manufacturer has the option to repair
or replace the item. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued amended guidance on
the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity s own equity. The guidance removes the separation model for
convertible debt instruments and preferred stock, amends requirements for conversion options to be classified in equity as well as amends
diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for certain convertible debt instruments. The amended guidance is effective for interim
and annual periods in 2022. The application of the amendments in the new guidance are to be applied either on a modified retrospective
or a retrospective basis. We are currently assessing the effect that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company s consolidated
financial statements upon adoption. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 

In March 2020, the FASB issued optional guidance to
ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting and subsequently
issued clarifying amendments. The guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting for contracts, hedging relationships,
and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued
because of reference rate reform. The optional guidance is effective upon issuance and can be applied on a prospective basis at any time
between January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In October 2021, the FASB issued amended guidance
that requires acquiring entities to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a business combination in accordance with
existing revenue recognition guidance. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods in 2023 and is to be applied prospectively.
Early adoption is permitted on a retrospective basis to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this guidance will
not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements for prior acquisitions; however, the impact in future
periods will be dependent upon the contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in future business combinations. 

In November 2021, the FASB issued new guidance to
increase the transparency of transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model
by analogy. The guidance requires annual disclosures of such transactions to include the nature of the transactions and the significant
terms and conditions, the accounting treatment and the impact to the company s financial statements. The guidance is effective for
annual periods beginning in 2022 and is to be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

There were various other accounting standards and
interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash
flows. 

. As of January 31, 2023, the Company only had cash and cash equivalents of and of short-term debt in default
and of convertible debt in default.. The debt agreements provide legal remedies for satisfaction of defaults, none of the
lenders of which to this point have pursued their legal remedies. While the Company has plans to grow its revenues through the new website,
at this time, our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management s plan is to raise additional funds
in the form of debt or equity in order to continue to fund losses until such time as revenues can sustain the Company. However, there
is no assurance that management will be successful in being able to continue to obtain additional funding. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note: As most of our leases do not provide an implicit

for financing are generally at significantly higher rates and we believe that physical space or vehicle rental agreements are in line

The Company had accrued interest payable of 
and on the notes at January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option for derivative
accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 Derivatives and Hedging and determined that certain features in some instruments
should be classified as liabilities due to there being a variable number of shares to be delivered upon settlement of the above conversion
options. The derivative features are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period or termination of the instrument with
the change in fair value recorded to earnings. The fair value of the embedded conversion option and attached warrants resulted in a discount

The Company has incurred losses since inception, therefore,
the Company has no federal tax liability. Additionally there are limitations imposed by certain transactions which are deemed to
be ownership changes which occurred in the Company on November 29, 2018. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carryforward
has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carryforward was approximately at January 31, 2023. The
net operating loss carryforward that is available for carryforward for federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in 2039.

reserved by a valuation allowance.

against its deferred tax assets at January 31, 2023 and 2022. A valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Since the Company cannot be assured of realizing
the net deferred tax asset, a full valuation allowance has been provided.

at January 31, 2023 and 2022 that would affect its effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the amount
of unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. Because the Company is in a loss carryforward position, the Company is generally
subject to US federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carryforward is available. If
and when applicable, the Company will recognize interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. 

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 and
2022, the Company recognized no amounts related to tax interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company is subject
to taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions. The Company currently has no years under examination by any jurisdiction.

exchange agreement whereby there was a change of control and any net operating losses up to the date of the transaction were forfeited.
