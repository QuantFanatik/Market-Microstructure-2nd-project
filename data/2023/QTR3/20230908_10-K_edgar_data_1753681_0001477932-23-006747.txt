Business Company Overview Elite Performance Holding Corporation EPH was formed on January 30, 2018 (inception) and is a holding company with anticipated holdings in companies centered on innovative and proprietary nutritional and dietary fitness enhancement products, that are in the sports performance, weight loss, nutritional, functional beverage and energy markets. The team is composed of highly experienced business, marketing and sales executives in the beverage and nutritional space, who are passionate about health and nutrition. On February 2, 2018, the Company closed on a Stock Exchange Agreement SEA with Elite Beverage International Corp. Elite Beverage ). Pursuant to the SEA, we purchased all of Joey Firestone and Jon McKenzie s 100,000,000 common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares in Elite Beverage, which gave the Company ownership of all of its assets and liabilities in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares of the Company. Following the SEA, Elite Beverage is a 100 wholly owned subsidiary of Elite Performance Holding Corp. Elite Beverage was formed on November 29, 2017 (inception) and is currently producing a first of its kind functional sports beverage. BYLT (Beyond Your Limit Training) sports drink is the first to combine the benefits of hydration, muscle repair, fat oxidation, and recovery all-in-one great tasting beverage. Whether you are looking to achieve optimal performance on the baseball field, basketball court, soccer field, in the gym or any competitive sport, BYLT provides the competitive edge every athlete actively seeks. This unique product is designed with scientifically dosed key ingredients to bridge the gap between the current sports drinks filled with sugars that have serve no function, hydration beverages and dietary supplements, without the crash from sugars and jitters from caffeine which eventually leads to a decrease in performance for athletes. BYLT is not only designed to enhance performance and support the intense physical demand of athletes but be safe and backed by science. This acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition by entities under common control due to the fact that both Elite Performance Holding Corp. and Elite Beverage were commonly held by Joey Firestone and Jon McKenzie. The ownership structure of the Company did not change as a result nor did any of its officer s change positions. The mission of Elite Performance Holding Corp. is to aggressively seek and acquire companies with niche products that are first to market and can be exploited in the 35 billion dollar nutritional and sport beverage industries. The goal of EPH is to effectuate its unique business model through strategic branding and marketing, to aggressively scale companies to size, and operate them efficiently to maximize growth, revenue production and eventual net income. On February 2, 2018, a contribution and assignment agreement was executed by Joey Firestone and Jon McKenzie (collectively, the Assignors ), and Elite Performance Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation (the Assignee ). Whereas Firestone and McKenzie were the owners of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.0001 par value, for a total of 100,000,000 shares of common stock (collectively, the Shares of Elite Beverage International Corp., a Nevada corporation (the Company ), which shares represented all authorized, issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Our Products and Services Elite Beverage International Corp will offer a first to market functional beverage called B.Y.L.T. (acronym for Beyond Your Limit Training). B.Y.L.T. was created to change the way you supplement your training to help you reach your goals faster and outpower and outlast your competitors during any type of physical activity, especially the most grueling ones. Patented SmartCarb technology, made of 20g of Palatinose and a 5g of BCAAs, it is designed to boost endurance, maintain proper glucose levels during training, and enhance recovery. Along with Spectra s potent antioxidant protection and HydroMax s superior blood-flow enhancing properties, this unique blend of key ingredients means that stomach cramps and bloating from outdated carbohydrate formulas are a thing of the past. B.Y.L.T. was formulated to promote enhanced recovery time, increased training endurance, and to support lean muscle maintenance while providing proper hydration. Palatinose, the only fully digested and slow-release carbohydrate provides a source of low-glycemic energy for a slow and sustained release of glucose for fueling training. This glucose-fructose disaccharide isomaltulose, discovered in Germany in 1957 and marketed under the brand Palatinose, occurs naturally in small amounts in honey and sugar cane juice. Palatinose is made from sugar beets by strengthening the glucose-fructose bond with the help of natural enzymes. This enzymatic conversion rearranges linkage in sucrose into a stronger, more stable bond that is broken down more slowly by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract, which is the key to the unique physiological properties of Palatinose . The result is a fully absorbed carbohydrate providing a sustained release of energy to fuel your training and recovery, all without bloating, stomach cramping or other gastric distress. This not only makes BYLT a truly SmartCarb product but makes it perfect for anyone looking to enhance their training and recovery or simply fuel and hydrate for prolonged activity. Additionally, Palatinose has strong clinical data demonstrating that it s unique properties don t inhibit fat burning, making it an ideal source of carbohydrates for sustained energy and those looking to improve body composition. 4 Table of Contents BCAA 2:1:1 Branched Chain Amino Acids have been proven to effectively increase strength, power, speed and muscular endurance along with enhancing recovery by providing critical support to Muscle Protein Synthesis. Numerous studies support the effectiveness of the 2:1:1 ratio for training for muscle size, strength, endurance and power. As the most studied BCAA combination, it has become the gold standard. L-Leucine Considered the king of the amino acids, it has the primary responsibility of activating mTOR which helps initiate protein synthesis and supports the body s release of insulin from the pancreas; This offers muscle supporting and enhanced recovery benefits. L-Isoleucine Primarily responsible for increasing glucose uptake into cells; works synergistically with leucine and has muscle supporting properties as well. L-Valine Helps stimulate muscle protein synthesis and supports the body s natural ability to eliminate excess nitrogen from the liver. Spectra Unique blend of fruit and vegetable extracts that increases cellular oxygen consumption and supports the body s ability to protect against free radicals. Helps manage temporary inflammatory response from training, translating to improved training and overall health. HydroMax Highly concentrated and bioavailable form of glycerol that helps increase the concentration of fluid in muscle cells, providing enhanced volume and hydration. The combination of these ingredients and without using artificial flavors or colors making it the ideal sports beverage for health-conscious consumers and serious athletes alike. BYLT will introduce two flavors upon launch while planning to strategically introduce additional 5 flavors to support the launch after three to six months of operation. These flavors will include Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, Lemon Lime, Watermelon, Grape, Orange and Fruit Punch. On September 29, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement between its wholly owned subsidiary Elite Beverage International Corp. and Bruce Kneller for the transfer and assignment of the SmartCarb technology (US Patent No. 11,103,522 issued August 31, 2021.) This Agreement gives the Company the intellectual property and patent ownership for 400,000 shares valued at 20,000 that were issued October 1, 2021. Competition and Market Overview The functional beverage industry is extremely competitive and has low barriers to entry. We compete with other sports drinks. Several of which have greater experience, brand name recognition and financial resources than Elite Beverage International Corp. Our management believes that the functional beverage industry competes in the global marketplace and therefore must be adaptable to remain competitive. Consumer spending for discretionary goods such as supplements and functional beverages are sensitive to changes in consumer confidence and ultimately consumer confidence is affected by general business considerations in the U.S. economy. Consumer discretionary spending generally declines during times of falling consumer confidence, which may affect the retail sale of our products. U.S. consumer confidence reflected these slowing conditions throughout the last few years. We believe that a stronger economy, more spending by young professionals with an overall trend toward health and fitness will lead to future growth. Therefore, we intend to make strong efforts to maintain our brand in the industry through our focus on the innovation and design of our products as well as being able to consolidate and increase cost efficiency when possible, through potential acquisitions. 5 Table of Contents Marketing and Distribution It is our intention to position Elite Performance Holding Corp. as a holding company for the purpose of establishing the vertical integration of like companies in the health and fitness industry in order to develop multiple revenue streams while minimizing risks through diversification. Our branded product lines are currently functional beverages and will be the centerpiece of our branding efforts. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new innovative products. Since our initial offering, our 100 wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Performance Beverages International, has completed 4 successful production runs expanding from two to seven flavors. We spent a full year test marketing our product in the states of California, Florida, Texas and New York in retail stores, various sporting events, and fit expos across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company chose to consolidate its operations because the brand had not been built to the level that the product would turn on retail shelves without consistent consumer education and marketing efforts, which were impossible to facilitate during the pandemic. However, the company is now ready to pick up where they left off and have hired a sales team of seasoned beverage professionals, a consumer education advocate, are utilizing several delivery vans branded with BYLT, and is now back to participating in various sporting events and fitness expos. Our initial target markets are currently Florida and California with a goal to spread into national distribution over time. Sales and Marketing With its all-encompassing benefits and better-for-you ingredients, BYLT is positioned to succeed in a highly lucrative market due to being first to market, its superior product offering and an ideal market opportunity. The breakdown of favorable market trends that will help fuel the initial growth and long-term success of the Company include: Healthy living trends and lifestyles are continuing, creating a drive for better-for-you trends, active lifestyles, and a growing demand for industry products from everyday consumers. There are currently no other RTD beverages that combine the benefits of BYLT that athletes seek out. In order to achieve optimal nutrients, an athlete must take 3-4 supplements that are often packed with unhealthy additives such as sugars and caffeine. Sports Drinks accounted for 70 of the entire Fortified/Functional beverage industry and is expected to continue its growth during the next four years to become a 32 Billion global market by 2027. BYLT is also positioned in the Nutrition and Performance Drink Industry which generated a total revenue of 27.2 billion. Mintel estimates sales of the category to continue to grow reaching 36.3 billion by 2028. According to Statista, 36 of individuals in the U.S. purchase a ready to drink sports drink 1 2 times a week, while 15 purchase one over 10 times a week. There is high potential for customer loyalty in the industry and brands that deliver on their promised functional and health benefits usually keep loyal core consumers. The Company has contracted GBS Growth Partners to strategically implement and execute its nationwide sales and distribution of our first to market sports drink. The key executives at GBS Growth Partners are comprised of former seasoned Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Dr. Pepper executives that have over 120 years of combined experience in the beverage industry. Their previous clients include Coca-Cola, Bolthouse Farms, Cinnabon, Nestle Waters, Honest, Celsius, and others. The Company will launch its products in a series of region expansions, as shown in the figure below. 6 Table of Contents Over the last several months, GBS Growth Partners has introduced the company to several high-level executives with stellar resumes specializing in the sales of new beverages within our space. Currently, the executive sales team works on a consultant basis. However, the company plans on making several of them full time employees in 2024. Figure 2: Map of BYLT Roll Out Strategy Customers As of December 31, 2022, accounts receivable, net amounted to 25,202 and 6 customers represented 100 of this balance and 1 customer represented 90 of this balance. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers Most of the inventory and raw materials we purchase occurs through our manufacturers located in Dade City, FL. Our inventory supply is based on the sales and revenues of our products. Inventory supply is ultimately determined at the discretion of Mr. Firestone, and the Company s COO, David Sandler based on his experience in the industry. Our inventories are commodities that can be incorporated into future products or can be sold on the open market. Additionally, we perform physical inventory inspections on a quarterly basis to assess upcoming styling needs and consider the current pricing in metals and stones needed for our products. We acquire all packaging and other raw materials used for manufacturing our products on the open market. We are not constrained in our purchasing by any contracts with any suppliers and acquire raw material based upon, among other things, availability and price on the open wholesale market. Intellectual Property The Company presently owns the intellectual property and SmartCarb technology patent (US Patent No. 11,103,522) which it acquired on September 29, 2021. Research and Development There were 0 in expenses incurred for research and development in 2022. Environmental Regulation and Compliance The United States environmental laws do not materially impact our manufacturing as we are using state of the art facilities with equipment that complies with all relevant environmental laws. We adhere to the highest quality control standards to ensure the best possible product, meeting all of our specifications. We only use manufactures that belong to the following trade associations and organizations. NSF The Public Health and Safety Organization NSF is an independent, accredited organization that tests, audits and certifies products and systems as well as provides education and risk management. We have recently received a passing grade in an NSF health food and safety audit. 7 Table of Contents cGMP Current Good Manufacturing Practice Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing and quality assurance in order to ensure that a dietary supplement is safe for human consumption. GMPs are enforced in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA.) FDA Registered Food/Beverage Facility The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the regulation and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs, cosmetics, and veterinary products.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry WE HAVE HAD LIMITED OPERATIONS, HAVE INCURRED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, HAVE LIMITED CASH TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS, AND WE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND RECEIVED A GOING CONCERN OPINION IN PRIOR PERIODS. The Company has suffered recurring losses. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had limited cash on hand and approximately 750,000 in convertible debt and loans payable owed at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company also had a stockholders deficit of approximately 1,822,000. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn, is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise capital and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. Management plans to achieve profitability by increasing its business through retail distribution and expanding its online ecommerce presence. There can be no assurance that the Company can raise the required capital to support operations or increase sales to achieve profitable operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. A DECLINE IN DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR INDUSTRY, OUR OPERATIONS, AND ULTIMATELY OUR PROFITABILITY. Consumer products, such as sports drinks, are discretionary purchases for consumers. Any reduction in consumer discretionary spending or disposable income may affect the sports beverage or functional beverage industry more significantly than other industries. Many economic factors outside of our control could affect consumer discretionary spending, including the financial markets, consumer credit availability, prevailing interest rates, energy costs, employment levels, salary levels, and tax rates. Any reduction in discretionary consumer spending could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 8 Table of Contents THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 The Company s operations were and may be continued to be affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which in March 2020, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The ultimate disruption which may be caused by the outbreak is uncertain; however, it may result in a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, operations and cash flows. Possible areas that may be affected include, but are not limited to, disruption to the Company s customers and revenue, labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in operations, and the decline in value of assets held by the Company, including property and equipment. OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY WORLDWIDE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND SPECIFIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS WE ADDRESS. In the recent past, general worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity, concerns about inflation, increased energy costs, decreased consumer confidence, and reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and adverse business conditions. Any continuation or worsening of the current global economic and financial conditions could materially adversely affect (i) our ability to raise, or the cost of, needed capital, (ii) demand for our current and future products and (iii) our ability to commercialize products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the display industry. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF OUR KEY EMPLOYEES, PARTICULARLY THE SERVICES RENDERED BY OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, MR. JOEY FIRESTONE, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. We believe our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the efforts and abilities of Joey Firestone, our Chief Executive Officer. If we lost Mr. Firestone, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which would result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of limited working capital. We can give you no assurance that we could find a satisfactory replacement for Mr. Firestone at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON, IN LARGE PART, OUR CONTINUING ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. If we grow and implement our business plan, we will need to add managerial talent to support our business plan. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in adding such managerial talent. These professionals are regularly recruited by other companies and may choose to change companies. Given our relatively small size compared to some of our competitors, the performance of our business may be more adversely affected than our competitors would be if we lose well-performing employees and are unable to attract new ones. BECAUSE WE INTEND TO GROW BY ACQUISITIONS AND SUCH ACTIVITY INVOLVES A NUMBER OF RISKS, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. We may consider acquisitions of assets or other business. Any acquisition or opening of another retail store or other operations involves a number of risks that could fail to meet our expectations and adversely affect our profitability. For example: The acquired assets or business may not achieve expected results; We may incur substantial, unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems when integrating the acquired assets; We may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business; We may not be able to raise the required capital to expand; Our management s attention may be diverted; or Our management may not be able to manage the acquired assets or combined entity effectively or to make acquisitions and grow our business internally at the same time. If these problems arise, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition. 9 Table of Contents BECAUSE WE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CONSUMER TRENDS, IF WE MISJUDGE THESE TRENDS, OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GAIN MARKET SHARE WILL BE AFFECTED. The beverage industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer trends and shifting consumer demands. Accordingly, our success may depend on the priority that our target customers place on fashion and our ability to anticipate, identify, and capitalize upon emerging consumer trends. If we misjudge consumer trends or are unable to adjust our products in a timely manner, our net sales may decline or fail to meet expectations and any excess inventory may be sold at lower prices. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR REVENUES COULD BE HARMED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN OUR BRAND IMAGE. We have limited revenues and have spent significant amounts of time and money in branding our beverage lines. We believe that primary factors in determining customer buying decisions, especially in the beverage industry, are determined by price, confidence in the merchandise and quality associated with a brand. The ability to differentiate products from competitors of the Company has been a factor in attracting consumers. However, if the Company s ability to promote its brand fails to garner brand recognition, its ability to generate revenues may suffer. If the Company fails to differentiate its products, its ability to sell its products wholesale will be adversely affected. These factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DEFAULTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. If customers responsible for a large amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for our products, or to make payments in a timely manner, our liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could materially affect the ability to collect these accounts receivable, which could then result in longer payment cycles, increased collections costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations. A significant deterioration in the ability to collect on accounts receivable could affect our cash flow and working capital position. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE SALES OR OTHERWISE SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. We believe that the key to our success will be to increase our revenues and available working capital. We may not have the resources required to promote our business and its potential benefits. If we are unable to gain market acceptance of our business, we will not be able to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability or to continue our operations. We may not be able to increase our sales or effectively operate our business. To the extent we are unable to achieve sales growth, we may continue to incur losses. We may not be successful or make progress in the growth and operation of our business. Our current and future expense levels are based on operating plans and estimates of future sales and revenues and are subject to increase as strategies are implemented. Even if our sales grow, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Further, if we substantially increase our operating expenses to increase sales and marketing, and such expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues, our operating performance and results would be adversely affected and, if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we implement cost reduction efforts to align our costs with revenue, our sales could be adversely affected. WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AS NEEDED, THE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS COULD BE SEVERELY LIMITED. A limiting factor on our growth is our limited capitalization, which could impact our ability to execute on our business plan. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of the Company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and our shareholders may experience significant dilution. In addition, new securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our Common Stock. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may become subject to certain operational limitations (for example, negative operating covenants). There can be no assurance that acceptable financing necessary to further implement our business plan can be obtained on suitable terms, if at all. Our ability to develop our business, fund expansion, develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, could suffer if we are unable to raise the additional funds on acceptable terms, which would have the effect of limiting our ability to increase our revenues or possibly attain profitable operations in the future. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MANAGE GROWTH, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY. Successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to manage our growth. Growth could place an increasing strain on our management and financial resources. To manage growth effectively, we will need to: Establish definitive business strategies, goals and objectives; Maintain a system of management controls; and Attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as, develop, train and manage management-level and other employees. 10 Table of Contents If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed, and our stock price may decline. Risks Related to Our Common Stock OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT CURRENTLY QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKETS (PINK SHEETS), WHICH MAY MEANS THERE IS CURRENTLY NO STOCK PRICE QUOTE, NO TRADING IN OUR STOCK, AND NO LIQUIDITY. We currently have no listing or trading symbol, and our common stock is not yet quoted on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter electronic quotation system maintained by the OTC Markets. We are seeking a market maker s sponsorship in order to obtain a trading symbol, and then intend for our common stock to be quoted on the OTC Markets. However, even if we obtain a trading symbol, and our common stock becomes quoted on the OTC Markets, the future quotation of our shares on the Pink Sheets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, and this illiquidity could depress the future trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. EVEN IF OUR COMMON STOCK BECOMES QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKETS, THERE IS LIMITED LIQUIDITY ON THE PINK SHEETS, WHICH ENHANCES THE VOLATILE NATURE OF OUR EQUITY. If our common stock becomes quoted on the Pink Sheets, there will likely be few shares of our common stock initially traded, the volatility of our stock price may increase, and price movement may outpace the ability to deliver accurate quote information. Due to lower trading volumes in shares of a typical Pink Sheet s common stock, there may be a lower likelihood that orders for shares of our common stock will be executed, and market prices may differ significantly from the price that was quoted at the time of entry of the order. IF WE OBTAIN A TRADING SYMBOL, AND OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKETS, OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE CONSIDERED A PENNY STOCK, AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SALE AND TRADING REGULATIONS THAT MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL. If we obtain a trading symbol and our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets, our common stock will be considered to be a penny stock since it will not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of penny stock under Section 3a of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is a penny stock because it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than 5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a recognized national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, or even if so, has a price less than 5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than 5 million. The principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. OUR CURRENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR, MR. JOEY FIRESTONE HAS SUFFICIENT VOTING POWER TO CONTROL THE VOTE ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CORPORATE MATTERS. Joey Firestone, our Chief Executive Officer and director has sufficient voting power through his ownership of 5,000,000 series A preferred with Super Voting Rights to control the vote on substantially all corporate matters. Accordingly, Mr. Firestone will be able to determine the composition of our board of directors, will retain the effective voting power to approve all matters requiring shareholder approval, will prevail in matters requiring shareholder approval, including, in particular the election and removal of directors, and will continue to have significant influence over our business. As a result of his ownership and position in the Company, Mr. Firestone is able to influence all matters requiring shareholder action, including significant corporate transactions. 11 Table of Contents EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A TRADING SYMBOL AND OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKETS, TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors . The term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules will discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A LIMITED ACCOUNTING STAFF, AND IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP OR MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TIMELY AND ACCURATELY OR PREVENT FRAUD, WHICH WOULD LIKELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON UNITS. We are subject to the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting and principles generally accepted in the United States, but our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which we refer to as Section 404. For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Based on management s evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, our management concluded that we had several material weaknesses related to our internal controls over financial reporting (See Item 9A). EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A TRADING SYMBOL AND OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKETS, THE MARKET PRICE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES WILL BE PARTICULARLY VOLATILE GIVEN OUR STATUS AS A RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMPANY WITH WHAT WILL BE A SMALL AND THINLY TRADED PUBLIC FLOAT, LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND LACK OF PROFITS WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR SHARE PRICE. YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL YOUR COMMON SHARES AT ALL, OR EVEN IF YOU CAN EVENTUALLY SELL YOUR SHARES, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU CAN SELL SUCH SHARES AT OR ABOVE YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO YOU. There is currently no market for our common shares, as we do not yet have a trading symbol, and our common stock is not quoted anywhere. Even if we obtain a trading symbol and our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Pink Sheets, the market for our common shares is expected to be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. Even after our common stock is quoted, the expected volatility in our future share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our common shares will be, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date, and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to when we will obtain a trading symbol, or when our stock will be quoted, or once quoted, what the prevailing market price for our common shares will be at any time, including as to whether our common shares will sustain their initial market prices, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common shares for sale at any time will have on the future market price. 12 Table of Contents WE WILL INCUR INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY AND OPERATING RESULTS. We voluntarily file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time-consuming and costly. We expect to spend between 25,000 and 50,000 in legal and accounting expenses annually to comply with our SEC reporting obligations and Sarbanes-Oxley. These costs could affect profitability and our results of operations. WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS CURRENTLY ILLIQUID, AS OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT QUOTED, AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. No cash dividends have been paid on the Company s common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. The Company does not expect to pay cash dividends in the near future. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as the Company s board of directors may consider relevant. If the Company does not pay dividends, the Company s common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor s investment will only occur if the Company s stock price appreciates. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. At the current time, the Company s CEO, Joey Firestone, leases office space monthly for the operations, and tangible assets, other than inventory, consists of general office equipment and computers. On May 6, 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement with its CEO, Joey Firestone, for three delivery cargo vans to be used in the delivery and distribution of its products. Mr. Firestone is the guarantor of these vehicles, which he acquired for the sole purpose of the operations of Elite Beverage International. Total deposits for all three vehicles were 19,000. Each vehicle has a purchase option upon the completion of the lease agreement. Our expansion plans are in the preliminary stages with negotiations being conducted to lease a larger warehouse space for the operations. Most likely no expansions will take place until additional capital can be raised to help offset the costs associated with any expansion. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. The company discovered in September of 2021 that BYLT Basics, LLC, a party that it settled a previous trademark litigation case with, is in breach of its settlement agreement and sent a notice of breach to said party. The underlying matter is a trademark dispute for the mark B.Y.L.T. (Reg 6548069) of which the company also filed two oppositions of the party s trademarks at the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Attorneys are in contact and being reviewed by TTAB which will determine if litigation is in order. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 13 Table of Contents PART II Item 5.

Therefore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. There are no restrictions on our present ability to pay dividends to stockholders of our common stock, other than those prescribed by law. d) Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans In February of 2021, The Company entered into an employee agreement with the CEO Joey Firestone and shall pay a performance bonus of 5,000,000 (5 million) restricted shares of Elite Performance Holding Corp. common stock for reaching each milestone of the following goals below.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements This report and other reports filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC (collectively the Filings contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, our management as well as estimates and assumptions made by our management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, future, intend, plan, or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current view with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors on page 8. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except, as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. General Management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiary. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial statement notes, and with the Critical Accounting Policies noted below. Plan of Operation The Company plans to offer a first to market functional beverage that redefines hydration and performance drinks using a patented amino/carbohydrate combination. The SmartCarb technology blend provides a unique benefit of hydration, endurance and sustained energy without caffeine, the crash of sugars, and without artificial flavors or colors making it the ideal sports beverage for health-conscious consumers and serious athletes alike. BYLT will introduce two flavors upon launch while planning to strategically introduce additional 6 flavors to support the launch after three to nine months of operation. These flavors will include Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, Lemon Lime, Watermelon, Grape, Orange and Fruit Punch. 16 Table of Contents The Company has instituted various cost saving measures to conserve cash and has worked with its creditors in an attempt to negotiate various debt terms. The Company has been also investigating various strategies to increase sales and expand its business. The Company is in negotiations with some potential partners, but, at this time, there is nothing concrete, but the Company remains positive about its prospects. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its endeavors or that it will be able to increase its business. Our future operations are contingent upon increasing revenues and raising capital for on-going operations and expansion of our product lines. Because we have a limited operating history, you may have difficulty evaluating our business and future prospects. The Company s operations continue to be affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which in March 2020, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The ultimate disruption which may be caused by the outbreak is uncertain; however, it may result in a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, operations and cash flows. Possible areas that may be affected include, but are not limited to, disruption to the Company s customers and revenue, labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in operations, and the decline in value of assets held by the Company, including property and equipment. Results of Operations - For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 90,588 compared to 6,938 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase of approximately 84,000 is mostly attributed to relaunching the product into market. Gross Profit Gross profit (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was (35,998) compared to (61,100) for the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease in gross loss is primarily due to increase in staff and operations and productivity. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were 2,607,834 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 797,665 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase of approximately 1,800,000 is attributed to an increase in legal and accounting fees of 155,000, an increase in advertising of 253,000, an increase in consulting expense of 1,045,000 and an increase in general and administrative expenses of 352,000. Loss from Operations As a result of the above, the Company had a loss from operations in the amount of 2,643,832 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 858,765 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net Loss As a result of the above, the Company had a net loss of 2,752,487 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 868,927 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021. December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Current Assets 214,149 10,220 Current Liabilities 2,007,751 1,903,463 Working Capital (1,793,602 (1,893,243 Our working capital deficit was (1,793,602) at December 31, 2022 as compared to a working capital deficit of 1,893,243) at December 31, 2021. This decrease is primarily attributed to increased accounts receivable and inventory at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net increase in cash of 7,192. The Company s principal sources and uses of funds were as follows: Cash used in operating activities . For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used (1,835,288) in cash from operating activities as compared to (343,251) in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was mainly attributed to an increase in the net loss, partially offset by an increase in shares issued and to be issued for services. 17 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company used 55,000 in investing activities as compared to cash from investing activities of 0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company purchased a vehicle for 55,000. Cash provided financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company provided 1,897,480 in financing activities as compared to 344,800 in cash for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is primarily the result of an increase from the sale of stock. Our indebtedness is comprised of various convertible debt and advances from a stockholder/officer intended to provide capital for the ongoing manufacturing of our beverage line, in advance of receipt of the payment from our retail distributors. Convertible Debt The Company enters into certain financing agreements for convertible debt. For the most part, the Company settles these obligations with the Company s common stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding convertible debt in the amount of 545,250. See note 9 in the notes to the financial statements for the terms and conversion features. Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is to increase sales and efficiently manage the production of our beverage lines and successfully develop new lines through our Company or through possible acquisitions and/or mergers. Our ability to obtain capital through additional equity and/or debt financing, and joint venture partnerships will also be important to our expansion plans. In the event we experience any significant problems assimilating acquired assets into our operations or cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic plan, we may have to reduce the growth of our operations. This may materially impact our ability to increase revenue and continue our growth. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses, and at December 31, 2022, the Company had a stockholders deficit of 1,805,214. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 8,993 cash on hand and 753,863 in convertible debt and loans payable. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn, is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise capital and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for research and development employees, stock-based compensation, consulting fees, lab supplies, and regulatory compliance costs. For the Year ended December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 we had 0 and 0 respectively in R D expense. Expected Purchase or Sale of Plant and Significant Equipment We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time. Critical Accounting Policies These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, its ability to generate profits from the Company s future operations, identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing. These factors raise doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 18 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues and the related costs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and acceptance has occurred, or service has been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Amounts invoiced or collected in advance of product delivery or providing services are recorded as deferred revenue. The Company accrues for warranty costs, sales returns, bad debts, and other allowances based on its historical experience. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 we had 90,588 and 6,938 respectively in revenue from the sale of our products. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation using the fair value method. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation and are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This update is intended to reduce cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments issued to non-employees (for example, service providers, external legal counsel, suppliers, etc.). The ASU expands the scope of Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which currently only included share-based payments issued to employees, to also include share-based payments issued to non-employees for goods and services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to non-employees and employees will be substantially aligned. This standard will be effective for financial statements issued by public companies for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the standard is permitted. The standard will be applied in a retrospective approach for each period presented. Long Lived Assets Periodically the Company assesses potential impairment of its long-lived assets, which include property, equipment and acquired intangible assets, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company recognizes impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values. An impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on the best information available in the circumstances. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment loss of 10,000 was recognized on a licensing agreement and recorded to other income (expense). For the year ended December 31, 2021, an impairment loss of 20,000 was recognized on a Patent acquisition and recorded to other income (expense). There were no other such losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022. Property, Equipment and Intangible Assets Property and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Intangible assets consist of acquired web site domains and web site content and are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided principally on the straight-line basis method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Recently Issued Accounting Standards We adopted the following ASUs during 2022, none of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures: ASU Effective Date 2021-04 Issuer s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Warrants January 1, 2022 2021-05 Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments January 1, 2022 2021-08 Business Combinations: Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers January 1, 2022 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform: Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 December 21, 2022 19 Table of Contents Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. In March 2022, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that eliminates the troubled debt recognition and measurement guidance. The new standard requires that an entity apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in ASC 310 to all loan modifications and/or receivable modifications. It also enhances disclosure requirements for certain refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and requires disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination in the vintage disclosure. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures. All other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elite Performance Holding Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has recently accumulated significant losses from operations and has negative working capital, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 8. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB . We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Going Concern As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has recently accumulated significant losses from operations and has negative working capital, which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern Auditing management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses, which are difficult to substantiate. To evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information along with management s plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern. s/ M K CPAS, PLLC We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018 June 5, 2023, except for Note 14 as to which the date is September 7, 2023 F-2 Table of Contents Elite Performance Holding Corp.

A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the more likely than not standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure There are no reportable events under this item for the year ended December 31, 2022. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Management designed the disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). A system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, the Company s management has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in a report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and the interpretive guidance issued by the Commission in Release No. 34-55929. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management has evaluated and concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022, and identified the following material weaknesses: there is a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of GAAP and the financial reporting requirements of the SEC. there are insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to the current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. there is a lack of segregation of duties, in that we only had one person performing all accounting-related duties. There is no formal written policy established for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions. Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The Company will continue its assessment on a quarterly basis. We plan to hire personnel and resources to address these material weaknesses. We believe these issues can be solved with hiring accounting support and plan to do so as soon as we have funds available for this. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Company s registered public accounting firm was not required to issue an attestation on its internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis. 21 Table of Contents c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Term of Office Our directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board, except to the extent governed by an employment agreement. 23 Table of Contents Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings To the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to our present or former director, executive officer, or employee: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. Meetings of Our Board of Directors Our Board did not hold any meetings during the most recently completed fiscal year end. Various matters were approved by written consent, which in each case was executed by the Board. Committees of the Board We do not currently have a compensation committee, nominating committee, or stock plan committee. Audit Committee We do not have a separately designated standing audit committee. The entire Board performs the functions of an audit committee, but no written charter governs the actions of the Board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit committee. The Board approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board reviews the scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor. Nominating Committee Our Board does not maintain a nominating committee. As a result, no written charter governs the director nomination process. Our size and the size of our Board, at this time, do not require a separate nominating committee. When evaluating director nominees, our directors consider the following factors: the appropriate size of our Board of Directors; our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our Directors; the knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in finance, administration or public service, in light of prevailing business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members of the Board; experience in political affairs; experience with accounting rules and practices; and the desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new Board members. Our goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Board may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders. In addition, the Board identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service or if the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Board then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Board may also engage in research to identify qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third-party search firm, if necessary. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10 or more of a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a). 24 Table of Contents Based solely on our review of certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the reports required to be filed with respect to transactions in our common stock during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, were timely. Code of Ethics We do not currently have a code of ethics that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or Controller, or persons performing similar functions. Because we have only limited business operations and officers and directors, we believe a code of ethics would have limited utility. We intend to adopt such a code of ethics as our business operations expand and we have more directors, officers and employees. Item 11. Executive Compensation. Overview The following is a discussion of our program for compensating our named executive officers and directors. Currently, we do not have a compensation committee, and as such, our board of directors is responsible for determining the compensation of our named executive officers. Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy The primary goals of our policy of executive compensation are to attract and retain the most talented and dedicated executives possible, to assure that our executives are compensated effectively in a manner consistent with our strategy and competitive practice and to align executive compensation with the achievement of our short- and long-term business objectives. The Board considers a variety of factors in determining compensation of executives, including their particular background and circumstances, such as their training and prior relevant work experience, their success in attracting and retaining savvy and technically proficient managers and employees, increasing our revenues, broadening our product line offerings, managing our costs and otherwise helping to lead our Company through a period of rapid growth. In the near future, we expect that our Board will form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs of our Company and with the full authority to determine and approve the compensation of our chief executive officer and make recommendations with respect to the compensation of our other executive officers. We expect that our compensation committee will continue to follow the general approach to executive compensation that we have followed to date, rewarding superior individual and company performance with commensurate compensation. Employees Currently, we only have two additional employees besides management. Employee agreements are only in place for Joey Firestone. Officers are devoting their time to the company in developing our products. Management is presently reviewing the near-term possibility of engaging qualified, full-time personnel to assist in developing and marketing our products. We may use non-employee consultants to assist us in formulating a research and development strategy, for designing, equipping and staffing future manufacturing facilities and for business development. We may find it necessary to periodically hire part-time clerical help on an as-needed basis. Consultants and advisors usually have the right to terminate their relationships on short notice. Loss of some of these key consultants or advisors could interrupt or delay development of one or more of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business plans. We expect to continue to need qualified personnel with experience in performance beverages. We may have difficulty in obtaining qualified technical personnel as there is strong competition for such personnel from other companies, as well as universities and research institutions. Our business could be materially harmed if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified administrative and executive personnel to support our expanding activities, or if one or more members of our management staff were unable or unwilling to continue their association with us. Retirement Benefits Currently, we do not provide any Company sponsored retirement benefits to any employee, including the named executive officers. 25 Table of Contents Perquisites We have historically provided only modest perquisites to our named executive officers. We do not view perquisites as a significant element of our compensation structure, but do believe that perquisites can be useful in attracting, motivating and retaining the executive talent for which we compete. It is expected that our historical practices regarding perquisites will continue and will be subject to periodic review by our board of directors. Summary Compensation Table The following table presents information regarding compensation of our principal executive officer, for services rendered during years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively.
