ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS 

Overview 

Singular Chef, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April
9, 2009 and has a fiscal year end of April 30. We were a development-stage Company that intended to provide specialized step-by-step cooking
tutorials through our website for monthly subscribers and on pay-per-view basis. 

On October 10, 2012 the Company changed the name of the Company from
 Singular Chef, Inc. to One Clean Planet, Inc. . The Board of Directors approved an amendment to increase the
number of shares of authorized common stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share to 550,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value 0.001 per share. 

On October 10, 2012 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to
effect a forward split of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock, at a ratio of 526.3:1 (the Forward Stock Split ). 

On November 26, 2014 by and amongst One Clean Planet, Inc. (CLPT and Kashin/Txtpay USA, Inc., a company incorporated and registered in the State of California, company number C3704841, whose registered
office is at 1740 W Katella Ave Suite Q, Orange County, California 92867, USA Kashin together with TXTPAY LIMITED, a company
incorporated and registered in New Zealand, company number 2273279, whose registered office is at C/-4 Blake Street, Surfdale, Waiheke
Island, New Zealand Txtpay together with Kashin, Kashin/Txtpay CLPT and Kashin/Txtpay, collectively referred
to as the Parties (the Agreement whereby Kashin/Txtpay shall sell, convey, transfer, assign, and deliver
to CLPT, and CLPT shall purchase from Kashin/Txtpay, 100 of the business of Kashin/Txtpay and any of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates. 

In exchange, CLPT was to issue to the Kashin/Txtpay Shareholders, their
designees or assigns, 10,000,000 shares of our common stock or 50 of the shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding
after the Closing as per the terms set forth in the Agreement. 

The Board of Directors conducted a review of the Material Definitive
Agreement MDA between the Issuer and Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand as to the validity and the compliance of the terms of such
MDA by Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand and its principles. Management believes there were misrepresentations made by the principles of Txtpay/Kashin
New Zealand, therefore the value of the New Zealand division is not confirmed. As a result, Management will not be issuing 10,000,000
post consolidation shares to Txtpay/Kashin New Zealand shareholders. 

On June 26 th 2015, the directors resolved to change the
Company name to Kashin, Inc., to reduce the authorized capital to 75,000,000 shares and effect a reverse stock split of 1:35. The name
change/reverse split took effect at the open of business 7/27/2015. 

We are unable to complete our business plan or marketing efforts because
we didn t have enough money, we ceased our development and/or marketing activities until we raise money. We had no activity from
2015 to current. We are currently bringing our company filings current to allow a reverse merger of a viable corporation to ensure our
investors do not lose their entire investment. 

Plan of Operation 

Over the next twelve months, the Company will be focusing on the implementation
of obtaining new avenues of revenue with Kashin, Inc. / Kashin USA, Inc. At this time, we are currently seeking new revenue sources
even with the addition of Business with Friends.

BUSINESS OF KASHIN 

Overview 

Kashin, Inc. fka One Clean Planet , Singular Chef, Inc. the
Company , our or we was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on April 09, 2009.
We have not had any significant development of our business nor have we received any revenue. Due to the lack of results in our attempt
to implement our original business plan, management determined it was in the best interests of the shareholders to look for other potential
business opportunities that might be available to the Company. 

In 2014, the company rebranded its name to Kashin (trademarked) and
established operations in USA and Africa (Uganda Kenya). During 2014, Kashin has connected its billing platform to VOIP systems
and now provides low cost international calls from any mobile to any country (branded Kashin Kredits). Kashin Kredits is now connected
to major Telco s providing mobile money services in Africa (MTN Uganda, Airtel Uganda, MTN Kenya and MPESA Kenya). Kashin is currently
in the process of connecting to PayNearMe services, which will provide 20,000 stores for customers to use cash to top-up their Kashin
mobile wallets for instant purchases of goods services globally. Kashin has since engaged with several other service providers on
an international level to allow Kashin Remote Top ups of minutes. 

In Dec 2014, Kashin merged with One Clean Planet, Inc. a public company
in which Kashin Inc. will become the surviving entity. 

April 30, 2021, Kashin has been a dormant company since 2014 and was
considered a Shell Company. 

On January 20, 2023 Kashin Inc. acquired Business with Friends, Inc.
a Texas Corporation.

Management believes that if additional subsequent private placements
are successful, we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not
be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. 

If Business with Friends, Inc. is unsuccessful in raising the additional
proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be very difficult
for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private
placement offering described herein and failure thereof would result in One Clean Planet having to seek capital from other resources such
as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because One Clean Planet
is a development stage company with no operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans
and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt
financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If One Clean Planet cannot
raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing, it would be required to cease business
operations. As a result, investors in One Clean Planet s common stock would lose all of their investment. 

Management does not plan to hire additional employees at this time.

We do not expect to be purchasing or selling plant or significant equipment
during the next twelve months.

Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

As of April 30, 2023, the Company has issued a total of 53,560,745
shares. The Company has not paid cash dividends and has no outstanding options as of April 30, 2023. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 

This annual report contains forward looking statements relating
to our Company's future economic performance, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projections of revenue mix and
other financial items that are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to, our management.
The words expects , intends , believes , anticipates , may , could ,
 should and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The cautionary
statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward
looking statement. 

Our auditor s report on our April 30, 2023 financial statements
expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our officer and director
may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next
12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See April 30, 2022 Audited Financial
Statements - Auditors Report. 

As of April 30, 2023, Kashin had 0 cash on hand. Management believes
this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised.
We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and
marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees - by additional equity financing. This will likely be in the form of private
placements of common stock. 

Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful,
we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be
available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements. 

One Clean Planet believes if we do not raise additional proceeds through
an extra private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult
for a new development stage company to secure. However, if such financing were available, because One Clean Planet has not developed any
operations to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest
rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business
could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If One Clean Planet cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement
of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in One Clean Planet s
common stock would lose all of their investment. 

The development and marketing of our services will start over the next
12 months. 

As of April 30, 2023 the Company has not generated any revenue. We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of 29,129 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 as compared to 21,884 at April 30, 2022
due to the company becoming dormant for the past two years. 

As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to
the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to establish the Company and begin operations was estimated to be
approximately 25,000 over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status was estimated to be 25,000 over this
same period.

Other than the above described situation the Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

 To the shareholders and the board of directors
of Kashin, Inc 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Kashin, Inc. as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and
cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). 

In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
 the Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s principal executive and financial officer,
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are defined as those controls and other procedures of an
issuer that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports it files or submits under
the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that Evaluation he concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures
are ineffective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information needed to satisfy the registrant s disclosure obligations under
the Exchange Act. Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our Company s principal
executive and principal financial officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are not effective because of the
material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures which are identified below. It should be noted that the design of any
system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the company (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal
control over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes maintain records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts
and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or
detected. 

As of April 30, 2015, management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting
established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on this evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of April 30, 2013. In making this assessment, our management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, as of April 30, 2015, such internal controls and procedures were not effective
to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the
design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered
to be material weaknesses. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company s
management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of
a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting
processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review
of our financial statements as of April 30, 2015 and communicated to our management. 

Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items
(2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Company's financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning
audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in
the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial
statements for the future years. 

6 

We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of
this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources
and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside
directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit
committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing
and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with
respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. 

Management believes that the appointment of more outside directors,
who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority
of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies
and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial
reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over
period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the
technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department.
Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department
occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company
may encounter in the future. 

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal
controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action
and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the year ended April 30, 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject
to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide management report in the Annual Report.
