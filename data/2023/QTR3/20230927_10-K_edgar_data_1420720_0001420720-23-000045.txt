 AI-Technology Platform Overview iBio s technology stack is a multi-layered, AI-powered system designed to significantly enhance the probability of success to discover and develop antibodies against hard-to-drug pathophysiologically relevant proteins. This platform comprises four key components, each playing a crucial role in the discovery and optimization of precision antibodies. The first layer, epitope engineering, leverages the patented AI-engine to target specific regions of proteins, allowing us to engineer antibodies with high specificity and efficacy. The second layer involves the proprietary antibody library, which is built on clinically validated frameworks and offers a rich diversity of human antibodies. The third layer of the technology stack is the antibody optimizing StableHu AI technology, coupled with mammalian display technology. This combination speeds up the Lead Optimization process and potentially minimizes downstream risks, with the goal of making the overall development process more efficient and cost-effective. Finally, our EngageTx platform forms the fourth layer. It provides an optimized next-generation CD3 T-cell engager antibody panel characterized by a wide range of potencies, Non-Human Primate (NHP) cross-reactivity, increased humanness of the antibodies, and retained tumor cell killing capacity with reduced cytokine release. Each layer of the tech stack is designed to work synergistically, enabling us to rapidly advance antibodies from concept to in vivo proof-of-concept (POC). Figure 1: iBio s Technology Stack

 AI Epitope Steering Technology Epitopes, the small regions on large drug target proteins, play a crucial role in eliciting a desired biological function when targeted with antibodies. However, traditional approaches to epitope-specific antibody discovery often face significant challenges. For instance, dominant-epitope antibodies, which typically exhibit low or no efficacy, can overwhelm traditional discovery methods. This inundation can make it difficult to identify and isolate the more effective antibodies targeting less dominant epitopes. Additionally, these traditional methods often yield low or even zero discovery results when it comes to high-value, therapeutically challenging epitopes. These are the epitopes that, despite their potential therapeutic value, are particularly difficult to target due to their complex structure or location on the protein. Another challenge lies in the limited availability of epitope-stabilizing immunogen scaffolds suitable for epitope grafting. These scaffolds are crucial for maintaining the structure of the epitope during the antibody discovery process, and their scarcity can further complicate the discovery of effective antibodies. iBio s Epitope steering technology is designed to address these issues by guiding antibodies exclusively against the desired regions of the target protein. By focusing on these specific regions, we believe we can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our antibody discovery process. iBio s AI engine creates engineered epitopes, which are small embodiments of epitopes on the target protein. The engine is trained to match the epitope structure as closely as possible and refine the designs for greater stability and water solubility, which are critically important factors. The optimized engineered epitope is then used to identify antibodies from na ve or immunized libraries. The application of engineered epitopes extends to a wide array of complex and hard-to-drug protein structures (as depicted in Figure 2). This broad applicability not only has the potential to unlock high-value targets in the field of immuno-oncology (I/O), but it could also be transformative in various other disease areas such as immunology and pain

 management. Furthermore, the potential use of this approach in vaccine development could open up new avenues for disease prevention. Figure 2: iBio s patented epitope steering technology Na ve Human Antibody Library The fully human antibody library is built upon clinically validated, entirely human antibody frameworks. By leveraging public databases, iBio has extracted a diverse array of Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequences. Subsequently, iBio has meticulously eliminated a range of sequence liabilities. Such careful curation process could potentially significantly reduce the development risk for antibodies identified from our library. StableHu TM AI Antibody-Optimizing Technology Antibody optimization is a pivotal step in the development of therapeutic antibodies. It refines an antibody s properties to enhance its efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. This process includes humanization, which alters non-human antibodies to mimic human antibodies, thereby reducing the risk of immune reactions when used in therapy. The proprietary StableHu technology is instrumental in this optimization process. StableHu is an AI-powered tool designed to predict a library of antibodies with fully human CDR variants based on an input antibody. This input can range from an early, unoptimized molecule to an approved drug. The model has been trained utilizing a set of over 1 billion human antibodies, progressively masking known amino acids within CDRs until the algorithm could predict the correct human sequence. While phage display libraries are often used in antibody optimization due to their vast diversity, they can increase developability risks such as low expression, instability, or aggregation of antibodies. Mammalian display libraries, on the other hand, offer significantly improved developability but reduced diversity due to the smaller library size they can handle. StableHu overcomes this limitation by utilizing a machine learning algorithm generating focused library diversity within the capacity of mammalian display. Mammalian display is a technology that presents antibodies on the surface of mammalian cells, allowing for the direct screening and selection of antibodies in a mammalian cell environment. This approach is advantageous as antibodies that express well on the mammalian cells used in the display are more likely to express well in the production cell line. Moreover, single-cell sorting of antibody-displaying cells allows rapid selection of desired antibodies based on multiple dimensions, such as potency, selectivity, and cross-species selectivity.

 When paired with mammalian display technology, StableHu enables antibody optimization with fewer iterative optimization steps, lower immunogenicity risk, and improved developability. Figure 3: StableHu TM Antibody Optimization Technology EngageTx CD3-Based T-Cell Engager Panel CD3-based T-cell engagers potentially offer significant clinical benefits in cancer treatment. They have the potential to effectively target and eliminate a wide range of tumor types, including those resistant to other therapies. By recruiting and activating the body s own T-cells to specifically target cancer cells, they can overcome some mechanisms of immune evasion, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes. However, first-generation T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies often face challenges related to safety and efficacy. They can cause severe side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome due to overactivation of the immune system. Additionally, they may lack specificity, which can lead to off-target effects and damage to healthy tissues. The lack of non-human primate (NHP) cross-reactivity also prevents safety assessment in higher species. To address these issues, iBio used antibodies from an epitope steering campaign as well as a first-generation T-cell engager as input and utilized our StableHu technology to identify a next-generation CD3 antibody panel. The sequence diversity generated by StableHu led to an antibody panel with a wide range of potencies, which allows us to pair the panel with a wide variety of tumor-targeting antibodies. Importantly, iBio was able to retain T-cell activation and tumor cell killing capacity with significantly reduced cytokine release. This reduction is believed to lower the risk of cytokine release syndrome. Additionally, the increased humanness of the predicted antibodies, thanks to our StableHu technology, reduces the risk of immunogenicity.

 Furthermore, our StableHu technology enabled the Company to engineer NHP cross-reactivity into EngageTx. This allows for advanced safety assessment in NHP ahead of clinical trials, providing another layer of safety assurance. Figure 4: CD3-Based T-Cell Engager Panel EngageTx TM Modalities Epitope steering, a technology iBio is pioneering, has the potential to positively impact various areas of medicine. In the field of immuno-oncology, it can be used to develop antibodies targeting specific cancer antigens, potentially enhancing the efficacy of treatments like checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapies. The technology also holds promise in the realm of systemic secreted and cell-surface therapeutics. Here, epitope steering can be applied to the development of antibodies, circulating immune modulation factors, secreted enzymes, and transmembrane proteins. This could be particularly beneficial in treating diseases such as heart failure, infectious diseases, and rare genetic conditions. In the context of localized regenerative therapeutics, epitope steering could potentially be used to develop treatments that target specific damaged or diseased tissues. This approach could be particularly beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Intratumoral immuno-oncology is another area where epitope steering could make a significant impact. It could potentially be used to develop treatments that alter the tumor microenvironment to favor an immune response against tumors, potentially enhancing the efficacy of treatments that use immune-stimulatory proteins. The potential of epitope steering extends to cancer vaccine development as well. The ability to target specific epitopes could be beneficial in the development of vaccines, particularly those that aim to increase the number and antitumor activity of a patient s T cells. Finally, epitope steering could be used to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases, including those in the immune-oncology space, immunology, pain, and potentially in vaccine development. This is particularly relevant for complex and hard-to-drug protein structures. Pre-Clinical Pipeline iBio is currently in the process of building and advancing its preclinical pipeline. The focus of this pipeline is primarily on immuno-oncology, with one program also dedicated to the immunology space. By leveraging iBio s technology stack, the pipeline is geared towards hard-to-drug targets and molecules offering differentiation. To mitigate target risk and capitalize

 on the learnings of competitors, iBio s programs are primarily adopting a fast follower strategy. This approach allows iBio to focus on targets that have to some extent been validated and learn from the advancements of those ahead in the field. Figure 5: iBio s Preclinical Therapeutics Pipeline Therapeutics Immuno-Oncology There have been notable advances in the field of oncology in recent years, and arguably none more important than the advent of immunotherapies. The Company has established its own AI drug discovery and drug development capabilities in San Diego, California, has built a pipeline of nine immuno-oncology programs. IBIO-101 In August 2021, the Company signed a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with RubrYc to develop and commercialize RTX-003 (now referred to as IBIO-101), an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody [mAb]. In September 2022, the Company acquired exclusive ownership rights to IBIO-101. IBIO-101 is a second-generation anti-CD25 mAb that has demonstrated in preclinical models of disease the ability to bind and deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T [Treg] cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors. Targeting depletion of Treg cells to control tumors emerged as an area of interest in oncology over the past several years. Since Treg cells express interleukin-2 R IL-2R or CD25 ), it was envisioned mAbs could be developed that bind CD25 and thereby trigger depletion by Natural Killer cells, resulting in stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. Unfortunately, while first-generation mAbs successfully bound CD25 + cells, they also interfered with interleukin-2 [IL-2] signaling to T effector [Teff] cells to activate their cancer cell killing effects. The result was a failure of first-gen anti-CD25 mAbs as cancer immunotherapies, since their favorable anti-Treg effects were negated by their unfavorable impact on Teff cells.

 Figure 6: Mechanism of action of first and 2 nd generation Treg depleting antibodies In vitro characterization of IBIO-101 demonstrated potent binding to recombinant CD25 while preserving IL-2 signaling. Further assessment of IBIO-101 showed selective Treg depletion and sparing of Teffs. Figure 7: In vitro characterization of IBIO-101 In a humanized mouse disease model, IBIO-101, when used as a monotherapy, effectively demonstrated its mechanism of action by significantly enhancing the Treg/Teff ratio, resulting in the suppression of tumor growth. When paired with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in the same model, the combined treatment of IBIO-101 and anti-PD-1 exhibited superior tumor inhibition compared to either anti-PD-1 or IBIO-101 used independently.

 TROP-2 x CD3 Bispecific iBio has identified highly potent, fully human TROP-2 (Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen 2) monoclonal antibodies, which have been formatted into bispecific TROP-2 x CD3 molecules using the Company s T-cell engager antibody panel, EngageTx. TROP-2 is highly expressed in multiple solid tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers and is closely linked to metastasis and tumor growth. TROP-2 antibody drug conjugates have been developed to deliver toxic payloads to these cancer cells but could risk harming healthy cells and cause adverse effects. The Company s bispecific approach has the potential to increase the therapeutic window, while promoting a robust and long-lasting anti-tumor response. Combining the bispecific TROP-2 approach with immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors can potentially lead to improved clinical outcomes. Figure 11: Proposed mechanism of action of iBio s TROP-2 x CD3 bispecific antibodies

Table of Contents 
 Using EngageTx, iBio s lead TROP-2 x CD3 bispecific antibody was engineered to potently kill tumor cells while limiting the release of cytokines, like Interferon Gamma (IFNg), Interleukin 2 (IL-2) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFa), all of which have the potential to cause cytokine release syndrome. When compared to a bispecific molecule engineered with iBio s TROP-2 binding arm and a first generation CD3 engager, SP34, the Company s lead TROP-2 x CD3 bispecific antibody showed a markedly reduced cytokine release profile, potentially indicating a decreased risk for cytokine release syndrome. Figure 12: iBio s TROP-2 x CD3 lead antibody shows reduced cytokine release while retaining tumor cell killing potential When tested in a humanized mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma, iBio s lead TROP-2 x CD3 bi-specific antibody demonstrated a significant 36 percent reduction in tumor size within just 14 days after tumor implantation, and after only a single dose.

 Figure 13: iBio s lead TROP-2 x CD3 molecule showed a 36 reduction in tumor size in an animal model engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear immune cells (PBMC) and human tumor cells MUC16 MUC16 is a well-known cancer target often overexpressed in several types of solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, and pancreas cancers. Specifically, MUC16 is a large extracellular protein expressed on more than 80 of ovarian tumors. Tumor cells can evade immune attack by shedding or glycosylating MUC16, making it difficult for traditional antibody therapies to effectively target and destroy the cancer cells.

 Figure 14: MUC16 structure and mechanisms to evade anti-cancer therapy Using the Company s patented epitope steering AI platform, iBio s innovative approach to this challenge allows its new mAbs to bind to a specific region of MUC16 that is not shed or glycosylated, circumventing both tumor evasion mechanisms and potentially providing a powerful tool in the fight against cancer. Figure 15: iBio s epitope steering approach and immunization strategy to target the non-shed MUC16 region During its immunization and screening campaign, iBio identified several hits that specifically bound to the non-shed region of MUC16 while no binding to the shed fragment of MUC16 was observed.

 Figure 16: iBio s hit molecules bind to the non-shed but not the shed region of MUC16 Establishing antibodies with the ability to bind to a recombinant version of their target protein represents a vital initial step in the validation process. However, it s crucial to ensure such antibodies maintain their binding affinity in a whole cell context, specifically when the target protein is expressed on a cell s surface. To best predict therapeutic efficacy, it s recommended to utilize tumor cells as a means to demonstrate and confirm this cell binding capability. During pre-clinical studies, iBio s MUC16 molecule has demonstrated binding to MUC16 on OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells as shown below.

 Another critical step in antibody optimization is the humanization of molecules originally raised in mice or other species. Humanization efforts of antibodies carry the risk of, among other things, losing binding strength. After engineering the leading MUC16 molecule with a fully human framework, the MUC16 molecule retained potent binding to the engineered epitope and maintained binding to human OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. Figure 18: iBio s humanized MUC16 molecule retains binding to the engineered epitope and human tumor cell lines EGFRvIII EGFRvIII is a specific variant of the EGFR protein, unique to tumor cells. Unlike the more common EGFR, EGFRvIII is not found in healthy cells, making it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. This variant is most prominently associated with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer and head and neck cancer, but can also be present in certain cases of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, among others. In our pursuit of innovative treatments, iBio is exploring antibody therapeutics that specifically target EGFRvIII, aiming to address these cancer types without affecting healthy cells. Leveraging our patented AI-enabled epitope steering engine, we ve specifically directed antibodies to target a unique epitope found exclusively on EGFRvIII, and not on the wildtype receptor, EGFR. Through this precision approach, iBio has designed tumor-specific molecules aimed at selectively targeting cancer cells while preserving healthy ones, potentially offering patients a more focused and safer therapeutic solution.

 iBio s lead anti-EGFRvIII antibody was specially engineered to enhance its ability to attack cancer cells and has proven effective in a mouse model for head and neck cancer. In preclinical studies, iBio s anti-EGFRvIII antibody demonstrated a 43 percent reduction in tumor growth compared to untreated animals. Figure 21: iBio s lead molecule demonstrates efficacy in a mouse model for head and neck cancer CCR8 GPCRs are one of the most successful therapeutic target classes, with approximately one-third of all approved drugs targeting these proteins. Compared to small molecule-based GPCR drugs, antibody-based GPCR therapeutics potentially offer several potential advantages, including superior selectivity, extended mechanisms of action, and longer half-life. However, GPCRs are intricate, multi-membrane spanning receptors, making clinically relevant regions difficult to identify and target. The chemokine receptor CCR8 is a GPCR which is predominantly expressed on Tregs, which play a role in suppressing immune responses. In the context of cancer, Tregs can inhibit the body s natural immune response against tumor cells, promoting cancer progression. Anti-CCR8 antibodies are being explored as a therapeutic strategy to deplete these Tregs in the tumor environment. By targeting and reducing Tregs using anti-CCR8 antibodies, the hope is to enhance the body s immune response against cancer cells, offering a promising avenue for cancer treatment. Aiming directly at CCR8 is believed to be a safer approach because it focuses on specific suppressive Treg cells in the tumor environment without affecting other immune cells and functions. It s important to make sure antibodies are fine-tuned to CCR8 and don t mistakenly target a similar receptor, CCR4. This is because CCR4 is found in many immune cells, and accidentally targeting it could potentially lead to unwanted side effects.

 Figure 22: Proposed mechanism of action for selective anti-CCR8 antibodies Using its unique AI-driven technology, iBio successfully identified molecules targeting CCR8, addressing some of the hurdles often faced when creating therapies that target GPCR with antibodies. iBio s specialized anti-CCR8 antibody has shown strong attachment to cells expressing CCR8 and effectively disrupted the CCR8 signaling process, resulting in the efficient elimination of Tregs derived from primary human immune cells. Notably, iBio s CCR8-focused molecule did not attach to cells overproducing CCR4, highlighting its precision in targeting only CCR8.

 iBio s CCR8 antibody has proven effective in a mouse model for colon cancer. Preclinical studies show iBio s anti-CCR8 molecule inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 22 percent reduction in tumor size compared to its pre-treatment dimensions. iBio specifically engineered the anti-CCR8 molecule as a high Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibody to enhance its ability to attack cancer cells. Figure 24: iBio s lead CCR8 antibody inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 22 percent tumor regression in a humanized mouse model for colon cancer Autoimmune PD-1 Agonist Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a pivotal player in the immune system, acting as a type of off switch that helps keep the cells from attacking other cells in the body. By agonizing or enhancing the signaling of PD-1, it s possible to temper the immune response, making it particularly valuable in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In conditions where the immune system mistakenly wages war on the body s own cells, such as in autoimmune diabetes or lupus, therapies that target PD-1 can potentially reduce the severity of these autoimmune reactions. This approach offers a promising avenue for providing relief to patients suffering from these debilitating conditions. The figures below depict the mechanism of action of antagonistic and agonistic PD-1 antibodies. iBio purchased the global rights to a partnership-ready PD-1 agonistic mAb intended to treat serious autoimmune disorders. While the goal in immuno-oncology is to remove immune tolerance towards cancer cells, in autoimmune diseases the opposite is the case, because autoimmune diseases can result from deficits in peripheral and/or central tolerance mechanisms which presents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Specifically, agonism or stimulation of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 or CTLA4, which mediate peripheral tolerance is a promising approach to treat autoimmune diseases. Unlike PD-1 antagonists used in immuno-oncology, PD-1 agonists are difficult to find. RubrYc used its AI Discovery Platform to discover PD-1. PD-1 is currently in the late-discovery stage, having undergone extensive screening and in vitro characterization, and we anticipate it will be advanced into in vivo models as IBIO-102, in the near future.

 Figure 25: A PD-1 antagonist antibody worsens autoimmunity and increases systemic inflammation Figure 26: A PD-1 agonist antibody improves autoimmunity, reduces inflammation in diseased tissue and maintains a low inflammatory status in healthy tissue iBio has harnessed the power of three core components of its technology stack to discover PD-1 agonists: the epitope steering engine, the proprietary naive human antibody library, and the StableHu antibody optimizer. Engineering the resulting agonist antibodies into both bivalent and tetravalent formats has led to potent PD-1 agonists.

Our top-performing molecules showed a significant decrease in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-2 and reduced expression of the T-cell activation marker CD96. Both of these outcomes are indicative of the desired dampening of T-cell activation.

 Fibrosis Fibrosis is a pathological disorder in which connective tissue replaces normal parenchymal tissue to the extent that it goes unchecked, leading to considerable tissue remodeling and the formation of permanent scar tissue. Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, including the lungs (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [ IPF ] and skin (e.g., systemic scleroderma [ SSc ]. IBIO-100 Our preclinical anti-fibrotic program, IBIO-100, is design and based upon work by Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick, Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and Vice-Chair of the Scleroderma Foundation. Her initial work was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, and we had a license to the patents relevant for the continued development of the molecule from the university. After careful consideration, in February 2023, we terminated all efforts on IBIO-100 anti-fibrotic program and provided a six (6) month notice of termination of the license agreement to the University of Pittsburgh, as required by the license agreement. Pursuant to the license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh, our financial obligations for the management of the patents under the license ceased on August 14, 2023, and at such time, transitioned back to the University of Pittsburgh and the Medical University of South Carolina. As part of this decision, we completed the pre-clinical cancer studies we were conducting in collaboration with University of Texas Southwestern using E4 endostatin peptide, which is derived from IBIO-100. After the conclusion of the pre-clinical studies, we determined not to further pursue this oncology program. Digital Infrastructure iBio is a firm believer in the transformative power of digital technologies, including robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and cloud computing. These technologies are integral to operationalizing our strategy, accelerating our learning curve, and executing at scale. As such, the Company has made substantial investments in these areas. iBio s aspiration is to digitize our operations to the greatest extent possible, harnessing the potential of digital technology to maximize our impact on human health. As the Company continues to grow, we remain committed to further investing in our digital infrastructure to support our ambitious goals. Strategic Alliances, Collaborations, and Joint Ventures iBio has formed collaborations and strategic alliances to gain access to funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual property to further its development efforts, commercialize its technology and to generate revenues, including through the use of our patented epitope-steering AI-engine and our EngageTX platform. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases On June 12, 2023, iBio entered into a research collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID ), a component of the National Institutes of Health NIH ), to investigate the potential of the patented AI-driven epitope steering platform for the development of a vaccine for Lassa fever, which currently there is no vaccine available. Based on the viral epitopes identified by researchers at NIAID s Vaccine Research Center VRC ), the Company will work with the VRC to determine if using the platform to steer immunity toward these epitopes offers advantages over other vaccine development approaches. Should the collaboration be successful, researchers at the VRC may assess promising candidates in both in vitro and in vivo studies, and potentially advance a lead candidate to a Phase 1 clinical trial.

 for mandatory prepayment upon certain circumstances. The Term Loan is secured by a lien on all of the assets of iBio CDMO and we guaranteed payments of the obligations owed under the Term Loan. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions, thresholds, notice requirements and grace periods), including, but not limited to, nonpayment of principal or interest, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, certain bankruptcy-related events or proceedings, final monetary judgments or orders and certain change of control events. The Credit Agreement also contains negative covenants which included a prohibition on the incurrence of Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) except Permitted Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and Liens (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and termination of the Ground Lease Agreement and affirmative covenants that have been amended and originally included delivery of audited financial statements within 120 days of the year end without a going concern or like qualification. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided that the Company must maintain unrestricted cash of no less than 10,000,000 (the Liquidity Covenant ), which amount has been amended to 1,000,000. On October 11, 2022, iBio CDMO and Woodforest amended the Credit Agreement (the First Amendment to: (i) include a payment of 5,500,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement on the date of the First Amendment, (ii) include a payment of 5,100,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement within two (2) business days upon our receipt of such amount owed to us by Fraunhofer USA, Inc. Fraunhofer as part of our legal settlement with them (the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds (see Note 19 Fraunhofer Settlement for more information), (iii) include principal payments of 250,000 per month in debt amortization for a six-month period commencing the date of the amendment through March 2023, (iv) include an amendment fee of 22,375 and all costs and expenses, (v) require delivery of a report detailing cash flow expenditures every two (2) weeks for the period prior to the delivery of the last report and a monthly 12-month forecast, (vi) reduce the liquidity covenant in the Guaranty (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from 10 million to 7.5 million with the ability to lower the liquidity covenant to 5.0 million upon the occurrence of a specific milestone in the Credit Agreement, and (vii) change the annual filing requirement solely for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, such that the filing is acceptable with or without a going concern designation. In addition, Woodforest cancelled the irrevocable letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank upon closing of the First Amendment. In January 2023, the Company s unrestricted cash decreased below the required 7,500,000, did not comply with the Liquidity Covenant at the time. As a result, on February 9, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ), which as amended, among other things, added a milestone that had to be met by a specified date, the failure of which would be an event of default. In addition, on February 9, 2023, the Company, as guarantor, entered into a second amendment to the Guaranty, which as amended, among other things, allowed the Company to account for the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds in determining whether the Company is in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant until a specified period dependent upon the occurrence of a specific milestone in the Credit Agreement. On February 20, 2023, iBio CDMO entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment ), which removed the added milestone specified in the Second Amendment, the failure of which would be an event of default. In addition, the Guaranty was amended to allow the Company until February 28, 2023, to account for the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds in determining whether the Company was in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant without being dependent upon a specified milestone. In addition, the Company agreed that each time it consummates an at-the-market issuance of Equity Interests (as defined within the Credit Agreement), no later than five (5) days following such issuance of Equity Interests, it will (i) pay to Woodforest in immediately available cash funds, without setoff or counterclaim of any kind, forty percent (40 of the Net Proceeds (as defined within the Credit Agreement) received by the Company for such issuance of Equity Interests; provided, any such payment would cease upon payment obligations in full and (ii) provide Woodforest with a detailed accounting of each such issuance of Equity Interests. On March 24, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment ), which within the Fourth Amendment Woodforest agreed to (i) reduce the percentage of any payment to Woodforest the Company is required to make from the proceeds of sales of its common stock under its at-the-market facility from 40 to 20 , (ii) reduce the percentage of any payment to Woodforest the Company is required to make from

 the proceeds of sales of its equipment from 40 to 20 , and (iii) allowed the Company to retain 2,000,000 million of the 5,100,000 million that the Company received from the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds, with the remaining 3,000,000 million being held in a Company account at Woodforest. In addition, the Company was obligated to (y) deliver to Woodforest an executed copy of a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement for the sale of the Facility, no later than April 14, 2023, and (z) pay to Woodforest a fee in the amount of 75,000 on the earlier of the date of the closing of the Purchase Agreement, or the Maturity Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement). In addition, on March 24, 2023, the Company, as guarantor, entered into a fourth amendment to the Guaranty, which reduced the Liquidity Covenant from 7,500,000 to 1,000,000. On May 10, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment ), pursuant to which Woodforest agreed to: (i) waive our obligation to deliver to Woodforest an executed copy of a Purchase Agreement for the sale of the Facility no later than April 14, 2023 and, (ii) release 500,000 of the 3.0 million being held in a Company account at Woodforest when the outstanding principal amount is reduced to 10.0 million and for each additional 2.5 million reduction of the outstanding principal amount, an additional 750,00 will be released from the Company account at Woodforest. In addition, starting on the effective date of the Fifth Amendment, the interest on the Term Loan increased to 5.25 , and the Term Loan shall further accrue interest, payable in kind and added to the balance of the outstanding principal amount at a fixed rate per annum equal to (a) 1.00 , if the Facility is sold on or before June 30, 2023, (b) 2.00 if the Facility is sold after June 2023, but on or before September 30, 2023, or (c) 3:00 , if the Facility is sold after September 30, 2023, or not sold prior to the Maturity Date. The Company also agreed to pay Woodforest a fee in the amount of (x) 75,000 if the Facility is sold on or before June 30, 2023, (y) 100,000 if the Facility is sold after June 2023, but on or before September 30, 2023, or (x) 125,000, if the Facility is sold after September 30, 2023, or not sold prior to the Maturity Date.

 acceptable with or without a going concern designation; provided that (y) iBio CDMO shall deliver an executed copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Facility within one business day after entry into the Sixth Amendment, and (z) if the Facility is not sold on or before December 1, 2023, iBio CDMO will pay a fee in the amount of 20,000 upon the earlier of the date of the closing or the maturity date. The Facility is a life science building located on land owned by the Board of Regents of the Texas A M University System Texas A M and is designed and equipped for the manufacture of plant-made biopharmaceuticals. As part of the transaction, iBio CDMO became the tenant under the Ground Lease Agreement for the land until 2060 upon exercise of available extensions. The base rent payable under the Ground Lease Agreement, which was 151,450 for the prior year, is 6.5 of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Ground Lease Agreement) of the land. The Ground Lease Agreement includes various covenants, indemnities, defaults, termination rights, and other provisions customary for lease transactions of this nature. The Facility has been listed for sale since November 2022 and remarketed starting July 2023. Intellectual Property We currently own 95 patents. Of the 95 patents, 24 are U.S. and 71 are international. Since July 1, 2022, we have primarily focused our intellectual property estate on our preclinical assets filing 10 provisional patents in the U.S. and foreign countries, including for chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) antibodies, epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) antibodies, anti-MUC16 antibodies, TROP2 antibodies, CD3 antibodies, and recently filed a provisional patent for our high-efficiency, conditionally-activated antibodies. We now have 18 U.S., 2 Patent Cooperation Treaty, and 32 international applications pending. International patents and applications include numerous foreign countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, and several countries in Europe. In the U.S. our patents expire between 2023 and 2036. Outside the U.S. these patents expire between 2023 and 2036. The 8 patents expiring in 2023 in the U.S. and overseas are related to virus-induced gene silencing in plants. Included in the 95 patents are 30 U.S. and foreign applications that we acquired from RubrYc for novel antibodies, scaffold technology, and a machine learning apparatus for engineering meso-scale peptides, including 1 allowed application. As part of the plant portfolio, we exclusively own the right to use certain intellectual property acquired by or developed at Fraunhofer for human health and certain veterinary and diagnostic applications. We also own intellectual property developed or acquired independently of Fraunhofer as part of the plant portfolio. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, we re-evaluated our business strategy and reviewed our product portfolio. After such review, we identified intellectual property, patent and licenses with a net book value of approximately 565 that will no longer be utilized and therefore they were fully impaired. In addition to patents and patent applications that we own, our plant focused patent estate relies on trade secrets and know-how, which we are currently seeking a partner to out-license such proprietary technology and processes. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and preclinical assets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. We continue to prepare patent applications relating to our expanding technology in the U.S. and abroad. The technology and products covered by our issued and pending patent applications are summarized below: Technology and Product Patents (U.S.) Virus-induced gene silencing in plants Transient expression of foreign genes in plants Production of foreign nucleic acids and polypeptides in sprout systems Production of pharmaceutically active proteins in sprouted seedlings Systems and method for clonal expression in plants

We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies. While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for biologic product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials,

 regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies for the purposes of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug candidate under development by a customer. There are currently approved vaccines and therapies for many of the diseases and conditions addressed by the product candidates our partners and collaborators may be developing or manufacturing or in our own pipeline. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. As a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on cancer therapeutics, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, our therapeutics can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Merck KGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, Lumos Pharma, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., as well as tech enabled drug discovery companies such as Recursion, Abcellera Biologics, Inc., Cellarity, BenevolentAI, and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches. Research and Development Our research and development functions are focused on the creation of new products and services, as well as enhancements to our existing offerings, both of which are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our research and development activities take place primarily at our facilities in San Diego. iBio has leased lab and office space in San Diego for the purpose of conducting research. For the Fiscal year 2023, iBio spent 10.3 million in R D related activities.

 Suppliers We outsource certain functions and supplies to third parties such as Charles River Laboratories, Sartorius AG, Fisher Scientific, Lonza Sales AG, and Twist Bioscience Corporation. While we rely on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions, we are continuing to build internal capabilities. Our suppliers are generally available to meet our demands and supply requirements, but our items are long lead time items that have been exacerbated by the current macro environment due to increased demand. We continue to mitigate the risks through inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when possible. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a description of risks associated with our reliance on suppliers and outsourcing partners. Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. U.S. Drug Approval Process All of the vaccine and therapeutic products developed from our technologies will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations, also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, FDA approved vaccines and drugs are subject to ongoing oversight and discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices GLP and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices GCPs and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application or NDA or Biologics License Application BLA for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the NDA or BLA based on results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidates are produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product s identity, strength, quality and purity; potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical trial and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensure of the BLA. 
 Preclinical Tests Before any product candidates with potential immunization or therapeutic value may be tested in human subjects, we must satisfy stringent government requirements for preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In vitro refers to tests conducted with cells in culture and in vivo refers to tests conducted in animals. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in several animal species, as well as data from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical trials. In the case of vaccine candidates, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be beneficial when administered to humans. IND An IND becomes effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concern or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such an event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials may proceed. For additional information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at http://www.fda.gov. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to potential safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. Clinical Trails Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA s regulations composing the good clinical practice requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (the IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials involving biological products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: Phase 1 . The biological product is initially introduced into a small number of closely monitored healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease. Phase 2 . The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Phase 3 . Clinical trials generally enroll a large number of volunteers and are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted. Many other countries in which we might choose to develop drugs or run clinical trials have similar rules and regulation. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union or other foreign countries, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Table of Contents 
 NDA/BLA: o Once clinical trials of a product candidate are completed, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Post-Approval Requirements: o Any products for which we receive FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirement : o In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH ), and similar state laws, each as amended. Once commercialized, we could be liable to ensure full compliance with the law. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement o Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. This is dictated by third-party payors coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
 Foreign Regulation: o In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Orphan Drug Act Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Accelerated Approval There are a variety of pathways under which applicants may seek expedited approval from FDA, including fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review and accelerated approval. The FDA accelerated approval program provides for early approval of drugs based on a drug on a clinical trial(s) showing that the drug meets a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint rather than a clinical benefit endpoint. Accelerated approval is possible for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need. A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. Because it sometimes can take many years for a drug trial to show a clinical benefit, the use of a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint can significantly shorten the time required to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval. If a drug receives an accelerated approval, the company that sponsored the application must conduct a post-approval trial to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit. These trials are known as Phase 4 or post-approval confirmatory trials. If the confirmatory trial shows that the drug actually provides a clinical benefit, then the FDA grants traditional approval for the drug. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. If the confirmatory trial does not show that the drug provides clinical benefit, FDA has regulatory procedures in place that could lead to removing the drug from the market.

 Healthcare Regulations and Healthcare Reform Healthcare regulation and pricing (included drug pricing) is complex, extensive, and dynamic around the world. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. U.S. Patent-Term Extension Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates or any future product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension (and only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended), and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of a patent term for our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there can be no assurance that the USPTO will grant us any requested patent term extension, either for the length we request or at all. Human Capital/Employees As of June 30, 2023, we had 23 employees in iBio and 3 employees in iBio CDMO that are maintaining the Facility until it is sold, all of which are full time employees. Our employees are not represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs, and iBio directly benefits from this experience and industry knowledge. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate

 its business successfully currently and will need to attract new talent to the organization in order to achieve its plans for growth. Competitive Pay and Benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically: we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location; we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry; we align our executives long-term equity compensation with our shareholders interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance; annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and commencing January 1, 2018, we established the iBio, Inc. 401(k) Plan. Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan, whereby they may elect to make elective deferral contributions pursuant to a salary deduction agreement and receive matching contributions upon meeting age and length-of-service requirements. We will make a 100 matching contribution that is not in excess of 5 of an eligible employee s compensation. In addition, we may make qualified non-elective contributions at our discretion. 
 Corporate Information We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 17, 2008, under the name iBioPharma, Inc. We engaged in a merger with InB:Biotechnologies, Inc., a New Jersey corporation on July 25, 2008, and changed our name to iBio, Inc. on August 10, 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 8800 Health Science Center Parkway, Bryan, Texas and our telephone number is (979) 446-0027. Our website address is www.ibioinc.com.

We have included our website address in this Annual Report solely as an inactive textual reference. Reverse Stock Split On October 7, 2022, we effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty five (1:25) shares of our common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every twenty five (25) shares of the Company s common stock either issued and outstanding or held by us in our treasury immediately prior to the effective time was, automatically and without any action on the part of the respective holders thereof, combined and converted into one (1) share of our common stock. The reverse split also applied to common stock issuable upon the exercise of our outstanding stock options. The reverse stock split did not affect the par value of our common stock or the shares of our common stock that we are authorized to issue under our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the reverse stock split instead were eligible to receive a cash payment, which was not material in the aggregate, instead of shares. All share and per share amounts of common stock presented in this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-twenty five reverse stock split.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Summary Risk Factors Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties of which investors should be aware before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The following is a summary of the more significant risks relating to the Company. A more detailed description of our risk factors is set forth below under the caption Detailed Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital We have a limited operating history developing vaccines and therapeutics. We are evaluating potential options to extend our cash runway that could impact our future operations and financial position. Substantial doubt exists related to our ability to operate as a going concern. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant losses. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future. We need additional funding to fully execute our business plan. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many risk factors. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and/or restrict our operations or rights. There can be no assurance that the sale of the Property will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Failure to complete the sale of the Property is expected to negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results. If the sale of the Property is not complete, we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the sale. The unaudited pro forma financial information included as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 21, 2023 is for illustrative purposes and although we do not expect actual results to differ materially from the preliminary estimates, our actual financial position or result of operations after the anticipated sale may differ from the estimates. A default under the terms of the Credit Agreement could result in action against our pledged assets. The Credit Agreement requires that we pay a significant amount of cash to the lender. Covenant restrictions in the Credit Agreement may limit our ability to operate our business. Potential use of government funding for R D programs may impose conditions limiting our ability to take certain actions. Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Technologies and Product Candidates We have a limited operating history developing precision antibodies and have no significant source of revenue. We are reliant on a limited number of product candidates that involve significant clinical testing before seeking regulatory approval. We may fail to capitalize on particular technology or product candidates that we expend our limited resources on. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates. We may not be successful in our efforts to use iBio technologies to build a pipeline of product candidates. Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. We or our clients, collaborators or licensees are dependent upon successful preclinical and clinical studies. If we, or our clients and collaborators, are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we, or our clients and collaborators, will not be able to commercialize our, or third-party, product candidates. Alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them noncompetitive. Our clinical product candidates may exhibit undesirable side effects. Our failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for product candidates could negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Product liability lawsuits could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit product commercialization. Any manufacturing problems experienced by our only third-party contract manufacturer could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our clinical product candidate. Risks Related to Dependence on Third Parties 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 If we are unable to establish new collaborations and maintain both new and existing collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. If third parties on whom we or our licensees will rely for the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies do not perform as required, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates. Our inability to obtain materials or supplies may adversely impact our business and results of operations. Any claims beyond our insurance coverage limits may result in substantial costs. We may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. Risks Related to Intellectual Property If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property. Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position for an adequate amount of time. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed . We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patent filings and other intellectual property. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. If we should fail to comply with various patents laws, our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated. Changes in patent law could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Risks Related to iBio s Operations We recently identified and remediated material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will not occur in the future. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could adversely affect our business. A failure to have an appropriately skilled and adequate workforce could adversely impact the ability of our R D facility to operate. A natural disaster, unfavorable weather conditions or other disruptions at laboratory would adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers proprietary information, we may be subject to claims. We may face integration risks and additional costs if we acquire companies, products or technologies. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stockholders will experience dilution from the issuance of the development milestone payments if paid in equity. We are subject to compliance under the NYSE American continued listing standards of the NYSE American Company Guide, the failure of which can result in our delisting from the NYSE American. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover. Our bylaws provide that the Delaware Court of Chancery is the exclusive forum for certain disputes. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock. Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results. We rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruptions. Holders of our warrants have no rights as common stockholders until they exercise their warrants. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Reports published by securities or industry analysts, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume. We are subject to reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies .

 Detailed Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. Past experience may not be indicative of future performance, and as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, we have included forward-looking statements about our business, plans and prospects that are subject to change. Forward-looking statements are particularly located in, but not limited to, the sections Business and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this Annual Report, the risks described below may affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If any of these risks occur, either alone or in combination with other factors, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Moreover, readers should note this is not an exhaustive list of the risks we face; some risks are unknown or not quantifiable, and other risks that we currently perceive as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected. Statements about plans, predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital We have a limited operating history developing vaccines and therapeutics, which may limit the ability of investors to make an informed investment decision. We commenced independent operations in 2008, and our operations to date have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our proprietary technologies, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking, through third parties, preclinical trials and clinical trials of product candidates derived from our technologies. During the past year, we shifted our focus away from generating revenue as a CDMO service provider to the development of vaccines and therapeutics for commercialization. Our current focus is on immune-oncology therapeutics. The current vaccines and therapeutics being developed are all in preclinical development. Certain vaccine candidates using iBio s technologies have previously been evaluated by other organizations in Phase 1 clinical trials; however, all of our vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Neither we nor our collaborators have completed any other clinical trials for any vaccine or therapeutic protein product candidate produced using iBio technology. As a result, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any Phase 2 or pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any conclusion you reach about our future success or viability may not be as predictive as it might be if we had a longer operating history. Even if we receive regulatory approval for the sale of any of our product candidates, we do not know when we will begin to generate significant revenue from such product candidates, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: set an acceptable price for our products and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; establish sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution systems; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical, manufacturing and planned future clinical development and commercialization efforts and operations as a public company; manufacture commercial quantities of product candidates at acceptable cost levels; achieve broad market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors and consumers; attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team; launch commercial sales of our products, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.

 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with development and manufacturing product candidates, we are unable to predict if we will generate significant revenue. If we cannot successfully execute on any of the factors listed above, our business may not succeed, and we may never generate significant revenue. We are reviewing potential options to extend our cash runway. This review could impact our future operations and financial position. We are currently evaluating a number of potential options to expand our cash runway, the implementation of which will impact our liquidity. In an effort to improve liquidity and our runway, we have placed our CDMO business and Facility on the market for sale and recently entered into an agreement for the sale of the CDMO Facility, reduced our work force and ceased operations of our CDMO, thereby reducing annual spend on expenses by approximately 67 and generating cash savings of approximately 64 from first quarter Fiscal year 2023 compared to the fourth quarter Fiscal year 2023. Potential options being considered to further increase liquidity, focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates, raising money from the capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a combination thereof. However, we anticipate that our expenses will increase as we continue our research and development activities and conduct clinical trials. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 7.6 million as of June 30, 2023, is not anticipated to be sufficient to support our operations for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report unless we reduce our burn rate further, sell the CDMO Facility for amounts above its term note payable, or raise additional capital. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-licensing certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our near and long-term business plans. In fact, our current cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of June 30, 2023, is not anticipated to be sufficient to support operations through the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be met and that we will be able to close on the sale of the CDMO Facility or that if we are able to do so that we do so on favorable terms or that we will be able to do so before the maturity date of the Term Loan or that the exploration of potential options will result in any agreements or transactions, or that, if completed, any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms. If we determine to change our business strategy, our future business, prospects, financial position and operating results could be significantly different than those in historical periods or projected by our management. Because of the significant uncertainty regarding our future plans, we are not able to accurately predict the impact of a potential change in our business strategy and future funding requirements. Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to our ability to operate as a going concern. We have incurred net losses and used significant cash in operating activities since inception, and we expect to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2023, we have an accumulated deficit of 288.9 million. We held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 7.6 million as of June 30, 2023. Based on current trends and activities, there is significant doubt that we can continue as a going concern beyond the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. We are currently evaluating a number of potential options to expand our cash runway, the implementation of which will impact our liquidity. Potential options being considered to increase liquidity include focusing product development on a select number of product candidates, the sale of the CDMO Facility, the sale or out-licensing of certain product candidates or parts of the business, raising money from capital markets, grant revenue or collaborations, or a combination thereof. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-licensing certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our longer-term business plan. We believe based on input from expert advisors, that it is likely we will be able to implement one or more options that will extend our cash runway for 12 months or more from the date of the filing of this Annual Report. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing any of the options that we are evaluating. Our consolidated audited financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next 12 months. Our management concluded that our recurring losses from operations and the fact that we have not generated significant revenue or positive cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months after issuance of our financial

 statements. Our auditors also included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023 with respect to this uncertainty. If we continue to experience operating losses, and we are not able to generate additional liquidity through a capital raise or other cash infusion, we might need to secure additional sources of funds, which may or may not be available to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to further scale back or discontinue the development of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives or initiate steps to cease operations or liquidate our assets. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses during our next fiscal year, we do not anticipate generating significant revenue for several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Since our 2008 spinoff from Integrated BioPharma, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our comprehensive net loss was approximately 64.8) million and 50.5) million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 288.9) million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. We devoting substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including the development and validation of our technologies, and the development of a proprietary therapeutic products against oncology. We have not completed development of or commercialized any vaccine or therapeutic product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may incur operating losses for at least the next year. We anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase substantially if we: initiate clinical trials of our product candidates; continue the research and development of our product candidates; seek to discover or license in additional product candidates; and add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and manufacturing efforts. 
 Our future profitability and cash flow in large part depends on our research and development programs, including our AI platform, and our ability to successfully develop, partner or commercialize our product candidates and to a lesser extent, which is not anticipated for several years. Our cash position is expected to limit the number of product candidates that we seek to develop. This will require us, alone or with our licensees and collaborators, to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which regulatory approval is obtained or establishing collaborations with parties willing and able to provide necessary capital or other value. We may never succeed in these activities. We may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. All of our existing product candidates are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize our products, we may be unable to generate revenue for many years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales for at least several years, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue from product sales, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would diminish the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future. Although we have recently reduced expenses, we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in light of the acquisition of the assets of RubrYc as our product candidates advance in clinical development, and as we 
 45

 add more employees. As part of the regulatory process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The number and design of the clinical trials that will be required varies depending upon product candidate, the condition being evaluated, and the trial results themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the clinical trials. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties involved in our business, the timing or amount of increased development expenses cannot be accurately predicted, and our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities, to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those we currently anticipate. We anticipate that further product development is also expected to increase expenses, including but not limited to the expected initiation of IND-enabling studies IBIO-101 and the additional studies that will be required to support development of our immuno-oncology programs. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. In addition, as we expand our business, we will need to retain additional employees with the necessary skills including employees for our continued expansion of drug discovery capabilities in San Diego, California. Even if any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with the commercial launch of and the related commercial-scale manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of future expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial position and working capital. We need additional funding to fully execute our business plan, which funding may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate the commercialization of our development and manufacturing services and efforts for our product development programs. Even if we are able to consummate the sale of the Facility, we will need additional capital to fully implement our near term and long-term business, operating and development plans as we do not anticipate that any of our product candidates will generate revenue in the next few years, if at all. To the extent that we initiate or continue clinical development without securing collaborator or licensee funding, our research and development expenses could increase substantially. When we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives. Additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We currently have no committed sources of funding. Our purchase agreement that we entered into on August 4, 2023 (the Purchase Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), allows us to sell shares of common stock to Lincoln Park only if certain conditions are met and there can be no guarantee that we will meet such conditions. The Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement that we entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor Fitzgerald in November 25, 2020 also has certain requirements that we must meet in order to sell securities pursuant to the Sales Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements to be able to sell securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or the Sales Agreement, of if we meet the requirements that we will be able to raise sufficient funds on favorable terms. In addition, we will not be eligible to sell securities pursuant our registration statement on Form S-3, including pursuant to the Sales Agreement, from the date of the filing of this Annual Report until March 1, 2024 due to our late filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed, especially in light of the fact that our ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 after we regain eligibility to use a registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is 75 million or more. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or

 commercialization efforts and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed. If we are unable to raise funds when required or on favorable terms, this assumption may no longer be operative, and we may have to: a) significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the product application and/or commercialization of our proprietary technologies; b) seek collaborators for our technology and product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; c) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize; or d) possibly liquidate assets or cease operations. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many risk factors, some of which are beyond our control. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control therefore we are unable to determine this amount with certainty. These factors include the following: the progress of our research activities; the number and scope of our research programs; the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities; the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements and amount of funding received from partners and collaborators; our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements; our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements; the costs associated with manufacturing related services to produce materials for use in our clinical trials; the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; the costs incurred to screen and enroll patients; and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals. 
 We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources. Additionally, we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates. Until such time as we can generate substantial development, manufacturing, license or product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances, service contracts, manufacturing contracts, facility build-out and technology transfer contracts, licensing and other arrangements. Sources of funds may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future

 revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue our operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through a public or private offering and sale of equity securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Sales of our common stock offered through current or future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. There can be no assurance that the sale of the Property will be completed in a timely manner or at all . If the sale is not completed by December 31, 2023, it is unlikely iBio CDMO would have sufficient funding to pay the Term Loan with Woodforest for which we are a guarantor. Although we have entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Property, there can be no assurance that the sale of the Property will be completed in a timely manner or at all. The closing of the sale is subject to many conditions including: (i) Majestic Realty s delivery to iBio CDMO and the Escrow Agent of written notice of its approval of the condition of the Property (the Property Approval Notice on or before 5:00 p.m. Central time on October 16, 2023 ; (ii) Majestic Realty obtaining the approval of The Board of Regents of the Texas A M University System of Majestic Realty s purchase from it of the fee interest in the Land on or before 5:00 p.m. Central time on November 13, 2023; and (iii) the delivery at closing by the title company of a title policy to Majestic Realty in the amount of the purchase price. None of the mentioned closing conditions are within our control. We cannot guarantee that these conditions will be satisfied. The conditions to the closing of the sale of the Property may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the sale may not be completed. If the closing is not consummated prior to the December 31, 2023 maturity date of the Term Loan it is unlikely that we will have sufficient funds the repay the Term Loan on its maturity date, the outstanding balance of which is 12,688,817 as of September 15, 2023. Our failure to make such payments when due could result in our loss of the Facility. Any action to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations, especially if the Facility or our other assets were foreclosed upon or our guarantee were enforced. Failure to complete the sale of the Property could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results. Majestic Realty s obligation to complete the sale of the Property is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to complete the sale will be satisfied or waived or that the sale will be completed. If the sale is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the sale, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock, which could affect its ability to secure sufficient financing in the future on attractive terms (or at all); we will be required to pay our transaction-related expenses incurred in connection with the Purchase and Sale Agreement whether or not the sale is completed; and matters related to the sale of the Property may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us. In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the sale. If the sale of the Property is not completed, we cannot assure our stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and common stock prices.

 If the sale of the Property is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the sale. We have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement. If the sale of the Property is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the sale . The unaudited pro forma financial information included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K is for illustrative purposes. Our actual financial position or results of operations after the anticipated sale may differ materially. The unaudited pro forma financial information included as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 21, 2023 and incorporated by reference herein is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been had the sale been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects adjustments, which are based upon estimates. The information upon which these adjustments and assumptions have been made is preliminary, and these kinds of adjustments and assumptions are difficult to make with complete accuracy. Moreover, the pro forma financial information does not reflect all costs that are expected to be incurred by us. Accordingly, the final accounting adjustments may differ materially from such pro forma information. The failure to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended, could result in a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended, and, if uncured, it could potentially result in action against our pledged assets. There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue or raise sufficient capital to be able to make the required principal payment under the Term Loan that iBio CDMO entered into with Woodforest. The Term Loan with Woodforest is secured by (a) a leasehold deed of trust on our Facility, and (b) a first lien on all assets of iBio CDMO including the Facility. We have also guaranteed the payment of all iBio CDMO s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan matures the earlier of December 31, 2023, or the acceleration of maturity of the Term Loan pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If we or iBio CDMO fail to comply with the terms of the Term Loan and/or the related agreements, including the affirmative and negative covenants contained therein, Woodforest National Bank could declare a default and if the default were to remain uncured, Woodforest National Bank would have the right to proceed against any or all of the collateral securing their Term Loan. Our failure to make such payments when due could result in our loss of the Facility. Any action to proceed against our assets would likely have a serious disruptive effect on our business operations, especially if the Facility or our other assets were foreclosed upon. The Credit Agreement, as amended, requires that we pay a significant amount of cash to the lender. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to make all required payments under the Credit Agreement, as amended, depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance the Term Loan, to fund planned capital expenditures and to maintain sufficient working capital depends on our ability to raise capital and generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. To date, we have generated minimal revenue and have financed a significant portion our capital needs from sales of our equity and most recently the Term Loan. There can be no assurance that financing options will be available to us when needed to make payments under the Term Loan or if available, that they will be on favorable terms. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make payments due under the Term Loan, we may need to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of the Term Loan on or before the maturity thereof, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we plan to explore potential longer-term financing options for our Facility, including, but not limited to, the sale of the Facility, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter consummate the sale prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan or refinance the Term Loan on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to restructure or refinance the Term Loan will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of the Term Loan could

 be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing when needed. Covenant restrictions in the Credit Agreement, as amended, may limit our ability to operate our business. The Credit Agreement contains, and our future indebtedness agreements may contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The Credit Agreement, as amended, currently requires maintaining 1,000,000 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricts our ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement); repurchase capital stock; make other restricted payments including, without limitation, paying dividends and making investments; sell or otherwise dispose of assets. As of the date of this filing, iBio is in compliance with this covenant in the Credit Agreement, as amended. In order to develop certain of our product candidates we will rely upon government funding. Any government funding for our R D programs may impose requirements that limit our ability to take certain actions, and subject us to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have applied for government grants to support some of our research and development activities for our product candidates. If we do not obtain the grants we applied for or other grants, we currently do not anticipate developing certain of our product candidates. Even if we obtain grant funding, the terms of the grant funding may be restrictive. Often government grants include provisions that reflect the government s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to potentially require repayment of all or a portion of the grant award proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event we violate certain covenants pertaining to various matters. Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Technologies and Product Candidates We currently have a limited operating history developing precision antibodies, no products approved for commercial sale, have no significant source of revenue and may never generate significant revenue. We are a pre-clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that recently began to focus on leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the development of precision antibodies. Prior to August 23, 2021, when we entered into a series of agreements with RubrYc, we were focused on our CDMO business . We have never generated any product revenue from the development of precision antibodies, do not expect to generate revenue in the near future and do not have any products approved for sale. Our operations to date have been primarily focused on developing our product candidates. We have not yet successfully conducted any clinical trials of any antibodies we have developed. Consequently, predictions about our 
 50 

Table of Contents 
 future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing product candidates. All of our existing product candidates are in very early stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. We currently have a limited number of product candidates in early stages of pre-clinical development and are dependent on the success of these product candidates, which requires significant clinical testing before seeking regulatory approval. If our product candidates do not receive regulatory approval or are not successfully commercialized, our business may be harmed. We are currently in preclinical development of multiple product candidates as potential treatments across multiple therapeutic areas; however, we announced we are evaluating potential options to extend our cash runway and may change the focus of our resources. It is possible that we may never be able to develop a marketable product candidate. We expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to our product candidates in the immune-oncology field. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of these product candidates, which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if regulatory approval is received. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of product candidates are and will remain subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries that each have differing regulations. We are not permitted to market any product in the United States unless and until we receive approval from the FDA, or in any foreign countries unless and until we receive the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in such countries. We have never submitted an NDA or BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities and do not expect to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future. Obtaining approval of an NDA or BLA is an extensive, lengthy, expensive, and inherently uncertain process, and the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of its product for many reasons. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, our focus is limited to the development of multiple product candidates. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other technologies or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending and the spending of our clients and collaborators may not yield any commercially viable products. We have based our research and development efforts largely on our technologies and product candidates derived from such technologies. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in these technologies, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed products using these technologies. As a result, we may fail to address or develop product candidates based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. We also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates using our technologies. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular technology or product candidate and fail to capitalize on technologies or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates derived from or enhanced by our technologies or that have been identified and partially developed by our clients or collaborators. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other technologies or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable

 commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending and the spending of our clients and collaborators may not yield any commercially viable products. We have based our research and development efforts largely on our technologies and product candidates derived from such technologies. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in these technologies, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed products using these technologies. As a result, we may fail to address or develop product candidates based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. We also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates using our technologies. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements on terms less favorable to us than possible. We, our clients and collaborators, are very early in our development efforts. If we or our clients and collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. All of our vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Our ability to generate product sales revenues for our own products, which we do not expect will occur for many years, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following: completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials with positive results; receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, which may exceed patent exclusivity, for our product candidates; making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for commercial manufacturing capabilities; launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; successfully maintaining existing collaborations and entering into new ones throughout the development process as appropriate, from preclinical studies through to commercialization; acceptance of the products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; effectively competing with other products; 
 obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for any products we successfully develop; protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval.

Table of Contents 
 If we or our collaborators do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. We may not be successful in our efforts to use iBio technologies to build a pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products. While we believe that data we and our collaborators have obtained from preclinical studies of iBio technology-derived and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates has validated these technologies, our technologies have not yet, and may never lead to, approvable or marketable products. Even if we are successful in further validating our technologies and continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for many possible reasons, including harmful side effects, limited efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that such product candidates are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we and our collaborators do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technologies, we will not obtain product or collaboration revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price. Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We estimate that clinical trials for our product candidates would take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. Commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including: obtaining an IND application with the FDA or foreign equivalent to commence clinical trials; identification of, and acceptable arrangements with, one or more clinical sites; obtaining IRB or EC approval to commence clinical trials; obtaining IBC approval for use of a genetically modified organism; unforeseen safety issues; determination of dosing; lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment; inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; lower than expected rates of patient completion of clinical trials; inability to obtain supply of our drug candidate in a timely manner; inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and unwillingness of the FDA or foreign equivalent, IRBs/ECs, or IBCs to permit the clinical trials to be initiated. 
 In addition, we, IRBs/ECs or the FDA or foreign equivalent may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if IRBs/ECs or the FDA or foreign equivalent finds deficiencies in our submissions or conduct of our trials.

 Neither we nor our clients, collaborators or potential licensees will be able to commercialize product candidates based on our technologies and services if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We and our licensees may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates based on our iBio technologies, including the following: Preclinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require additional preclinical testing, additional clinical trials or the abandonment of projects that we expect to be promising. For example, promising animal data may be obtained about the anticipated efficacy of a therapeutic protein product candidate and then human tests may not result in such an effect. In addition, unexpected safety concerns may be encountered that would require further testing even if the therapeutic protein product candidate produced an otherwise favorable response in human subjects. Initial clinical results may not be supported by further or more extensive clinical trials. For example, a licensee may obtain data that suggest a desirable immune response from a product candidate in a small human study, but when tests are conducted on larger numbers of people, the same extent of immune response may not occur. If the immune response generated by a product candidate is too low or occurs in too few treated individuals, then the product candidate will have no commercial value. Enrollment in any clinical trials that we or our licensee s conduct may be slower than projected, resulting in significant delays. The cost of conducting a clinical trial increases as the time required to enroll adequate numbers of human subjects to obtain meaningful results increases. Enrollment in a clinical trial can be a slower-than-anticipated process because of competition from other clinical trials, because the study is not of interest to qualified subjects, or because the stringency of requirements for enrollment limits the number of people who are eligible to participate in the clinical trial. We or our potential licensees might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Animal tests do not always adequately predict potential safety risks to human subjects. The risk of any candidate product is unknown until it is tested in human subjects, and if subjects experience adverse events during the clinical trial, the trial may have to be suspended and modified or terminated entirely. Regulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. Any regulatory approval ultimately obtained may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable. 
 The effects of iBio technology-derived or iBio technology-enhanced product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects. 
 Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we or our licensees do and impair our ability to commercialize our technologies and product candidates based on our technologies. Poor clinical trial results or delays may make it impossible to license a product candidate, or reduce its attractiveness to prospective licensees, so that we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize such a product candidate. Clinical trials are risky, lengthy, and expensive. We will incur substantial expense for, and devote significant time and resources to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet we cannot be certain that these tests and trials will demonstrate that a product candidate is effective and well-tolerated or will ever support its approval and commercial sale. For example, 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 clinical trials require adequate supplies of clinical trial material and sufficient patient enrollment to power the trial. Delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Even if we, or a licensee or collaborator, if applicable, successfully complete clinical trials for our clinical product candidate, we or they might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive marketing approval for the clinical product candidate. We cannot assure you that our clinical product candidate will successfully progress further through the drug development process or will ultimately result in an approved and commercially viable product. If we, or our clients and collaborators, are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we, or our clients and collaborators, will not be able to develop or commercialize our, or third-party, product candidates or will not be able to do so as soon as anticipated, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to engage in any clinical trials for any of our product candidates and there is no assurance that we will conduct successful clinical trials or obtain approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use in such a restrictive manner that it is not possible to obtain commercial viability for such product. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years. If additional clinical trials are required for certain jurisdictions, these trials can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the review and approval of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept a marketing application as deficient or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Although the FDA and other regulatory authorities have approved plant-based therapeutics in the past, consistent with the oversight of all products, the FDA is monitoring whether these plant-based therapeutics pose any health and human safety risks. While they have not issued any regulation to date that is averse to plant-based vaccines or therapeutics, it is possible that the FDA and other regulatory authorities could issue regulations in the future that could adversely affect our product candidates. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising and promotional activities for such product candidate, among other things, will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety, 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 efficacy and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration and drug listing requirements, continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping and current GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval. If our clinical product candidate receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales. Alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them noncompetitive, which would harm our ability to generate future revenue. The manufacture of precision antibodies and use of artificial intelligence to do so is intensely competitive. There are currently extensive research efforts in this field, which result in rapid technological progress that can render existing technologies obsolete or economically noncompetitive. If our competitors succeed in developing more effective technologies or render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, our business will suffer. Many universities, public agencies and established pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies with substantially greater resources than we have are developing and using technologies and are actively engaging in the development of products similar to or competitive with our technologies and products. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in new technologies and improve existing technologies. To make such renewing investment we will need to obtain additional financing and/or collaborations. If we are unable to secure such financing, we will not have sufficient resources to continue such investment. In addition, they also have significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of products, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those products in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Our competitors may devise methods and processes for protein expression that are faster, more efficient or less costly than that which can be achieved using iBio technologies. There has been and continues to be substantial academic and commercial research effort devoted to the development of such methods and processes. If successful competitive methods are developed, it may undermine the commercial basis for iBio products and our technologies and related services. For our cancer product candidates, not only will we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we will also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, Lumos Pharma, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., as well as tech enabled drug discovery companies such as Recursion, Abcellera Biologics, Inc., Cellarity, and BenevolentAI. Our product candidates may exhibit undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved pharmaceutical products, which may delay or preclude its development or regulatory approval or limit its use if ever approved. Throughout the drug development process, we must continually demonstrate the activity, safety, and tolerability of our product candidates in order to obtain regulatory approval to further advance our clinical development, or to eventually market it. Even if any of our product candidates demonstrate adequate biologic activity and clear clinical benefit, any 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 unacceptable side effects or adverse events, when administered alone or in the presence of other pharmaceutical products, may outweigh these potential benefits. We may observe adverse or serious adverse events or drug-drug interactions in preclinical studies or clinical trials of our clinical product candidate, which could result in the delay or termination of its development, prevent regulatory approval, or limit its market acceptance if it is ultimately approved. Adverse events caused by any of our product candidates or generally by plant-based therapeutics could cause reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. If an unacceptable frequency or severity of adverse events are reported in any clinical trials we may conduct for our product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for such clinical product candidate may be negatively impacted. In addition, adverse events caused by any product candidate administered in combination with our product candidates could cause similar interruptions and delays, even though not caused by our product candidates. Furthermore, if any of our products are approved and then cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the clinical product candidate or impose restrictions on its distribution or other risk management measures; regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications; we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials; we could be sued and held liable for injuries sustained by patients; we could elect to discontinue the sale of the clinical product candidate; and our reputation may suffer. 
 Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected clinical product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercialization. Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop. We face the risk of product liability exposure in connection with the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop; injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; withdrawal of clinical trial participants; significant costs to defend the related litigation; substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; loss of revenue; reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and 

 57 

Table of Contents 
 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop. 
 Prior to commencing human clinical trials, we will seek to obtain product liability insurance coverage. Such insurance coverage is expensive and may not be available in coverage amounts we seek or at all. If we obtain such coverage, we may in the future be unable to maintain such coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Risks Related to Dependence on Third Parties For our clinical product candidates, we currently rely on one third-party contract manufacturer. Any manufacturing problems experienced by us could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our clinical product candidate until the problem is cured or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing and supply. We currently do not manufacture any of our clinical product candidates and currently rely upon one third-party manufacturer to manufacture such product candidates. If we were to experience any prolonged disruption for our manufacturing, we could be forced to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and negatively impacting our timelines and any commercialization costs. Although we believe there are other manufacturers that could manufacture our product candidates, they may not do so on favorable term. In addition, if we change manufacturers at any point once we commence clinical trials or after approval of a product candidate, we will be required to demonstrate comparability between the product manufactured by the old manufacturer and the product manufactured by the new manufacturer. If we are unable to do so we may need to conduct additional clinical trials with product manufactured by the new manufacturer. If we or any outsourced manufacturer of our products are not able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our clinical product candidate, our development activities would be impaired. In addition, any manufacturing facility where any of our clinical product candidates are manufactured will be subject to ongoing, periodic inspection by the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP. Any failure to follow and document the manufacturer s adherence to such cGMP regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of clinical bulk drug substance and finished product for clinical trials, which may result in the termination of or a hold on a clinical trial, or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our clinical product candidate. We also may encounter problems with the following: achieving adequate or clinical-grade materials that meet FDA or other comparable regulatory agency standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yield and costs; failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support late-stage clinical trials for, or the commercialization of, our clinical product candidate; being unable to increase the scale of or the capacity for, or reformulate the form of our clinical product candidate, which may cause us to experience a shortage in supply or cause the cost to manufacture our clinical product candidate to increase; we cannot assure you that we will be able to manufacture our clinical product candidate at a suitable commercial scale, or that we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so; our facility closing as a result of regulatory sanctions, pandemic or a natural disaster; shortages of qualified personnel, raw materials or key contractors; failing to obtain FDA approval for commercial scale manufacturing; and 
 58 

Table of Contents 
 ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations and other requirements of the FDA or other comparable regulatory agencies. 
 If we encounter any of these problems or are otherwise delayed, or if the cost of manufacturing is not economically feasible or we cannot find another third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to produce our clinical product candidate in a sufficient quantity to meet future demand. These risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with our current products and manufacturing processes. If demand for our products materializes, we may have to invest additional resources to purchase materials, hire and train employees, and enhance our manufacturing processes or those of third-party manufacturers. It may not be possible for us to manufacture our clinical product candidate at a cost or in quantities sufficient to make its clinical product candidate commercially viable. Any of these factors may affect our ability to manufacture our products and could reduce gross margins and profitability. Reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufacture our clinical product candidate ourselves, including: reliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities. 
 If we rely on a third-party contract manufacturer or its suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of our clinical product candidate required for our clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial sale, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers or suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and would have to delay or terminate our pre-clinical or clinical trials, and we would lose potential revenue. It may also take significant time to establish an alternative source of supply for our clinical product candidate and to have any such new source approved by the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authorities. Furthermore, any of the above factors could cause the delay or suspension of initiation or completion of clinical trials, regulatory submissions or required approvals of our clinical product candidate, cause it to incur higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our clinical product candidate successfully. If we are unable to establish new collaborations and maintain both new and existing collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. Our current business plan contemplates that we will in the future derive revenues or payments from collaborators and licensees that successfully utilize iBio technologies in connection with the production, development and commercialization of vaccines and therapeutic protein product candidates. Our realization of these revenues and payments including dependence on existing collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, is subject to a number of risks, including the following: collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations; collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; collaborators may not pursue development and, if successful, commercialization of product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes

Table of Contents 
 in the collaborators strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, which divert resources or create competing priorities; collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates; collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we would potentially lose the right to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; collaborators may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future; results of collaborators preclinical or clinical studies could produce results that harm or impair other products using our technology; there may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and others; and the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers. 
 If our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. There can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all. We seek to establish and collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of iBio technology-produced and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration depends, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of several factors. If we fail to reach agreements 
 60 

Table of Contents 
 with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development or the development of one or more of our other product candidates, or increase our expenditures and undertake additional development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product portfolio and our business may be materially and adversely affected. If third parties on whom we or our licensees will rely for the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business may suffer. We have limited resources dedicated to designing, conducting, and managing our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have the ability to independently conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We have not yet contracted with any third parties to conduct clinical trials of product candidates we develop independently of collaborators. We will depend on licensees or on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates. We will rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the clinical development process on our behalf, including conducting preclinical studies and will rely on them for the recruitment of sites and subjects for participation in our clinical trials, maintenance of good relations with the clinical sites, and ensuring that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the trial protocol and applicable regulations. We will rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials but will not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators participating in our clinical trials will not be our employees. However, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates. If these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily, or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them, we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures, and therefore the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our clinical product candidate may be delayed or prove unsuccessful. Further, the FDA, the EMA, or similar regulatory authorities in other countries, may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials or our third-party vendors sites to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, or similar regulations. If we or a regulatory authority determine that our third-party vendors are not in compliance with or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations, we may be forced to exclude certain data from the results of the trial, or delay, repeat or terminate such clinical trials. We rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to operate our research and development activities and do not have any long-term commitments from such suppliers. We currently rely on third parties for the raw materials needed to operate our research and development activities. We do not have any long-term commitments from any raw material suppliers and therefore cannot guarantee that there will be adequate supply of our raw materials. Natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our suppliers facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products. Influenza or other pandemics, such as the coronavirus, could disrupt production of our products, reduce demand for certain of our products, or disrupt the marketplace in the food service or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations. To the extent we are unable to, or cannot, financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain. Although we believe we have sufficient supply of our other raw materials at this time, due to supply chain shortages, we may not be able to obtain such materials

 in the future is our current suppliers should be unable to satisfy our needs. Such suppliers may not be able to provide us with engines in a timely manner due to supply chain shortages and even if other suppliers are able to fulfill our needs they may not be able to do so at the same price as we currently pay for such materials, which could result in lower profit margins or us increasing the price of our services in order to maintain profit margins which could adversely impact demand for our services. Any claims beyond our insurance coverage limits, or that are otherwise not covered by our insurance, may result in substantial costs and a reduction in our available capital resources. We maintain property insurance, employer s liability insurance, product liability insurance, general liability insurance, business interruption insurance, and directors and officers liability insurance, among others. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage, potential claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. Generally, we would be at risk for the loss of inventory that is not within customer specifications. These amounts could be significant. In addition, in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage, or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage. We may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We, as well as certain of our directors and officers, may be subject to claims or lawsuits during the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted. Risks Related to Intellectual Property If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates, and by maintenance of our trade secrets through proper procedures. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued 
 62 

Table of Contents 
 which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Even if our pending or future patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. Our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could adversely affect us and our collaborators. While no such litigation has been brought against us and we have not been held by any court to have infringed a third party s intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that our technology, products or use of our products do not infringe third-party patents. It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000, and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing date, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. PTO 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 and similar bodies in other countries. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In spite of our efforts, our licensors might allege that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore attempt to terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties might have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of our lead products or other product candidates that we may identify. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including: the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and the priority of invention of patented technology.

 In addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patent filings and other intellectual property. Many of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. These employees typically executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with their previous employers. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee s former employer. We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, 
 65

 or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, while we require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative: others may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license; our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application; our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our or our licensors technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; pending patent applications may not lead to issued patents; issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and we may choose not to file a patent application for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently obtain a patent covering such intellectual property. 
 Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made 
 66 

Table of Contents 
 using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. If we should fail to comply with various patent laws our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in patent law, including recent patent reform legislation, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor s patents or patent applications. In addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.

 Risks Related to iBio s Operations We recently identified and remediated material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future . Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. During the preparation of the Quarterly Report for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our controls relating to accounting for stock-based compensation expense relating to the vesting of severed employees awards. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. In addition, a material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. As of June 30, 2023, management believes that significant progress has been made in enhancing internal controls and has concluded that the enhanced controls are operating effectively. Therefore, as of June 30, 2023, the material weakness described in Item 4 Controls and Procedures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for quarter ended March 31, 2023 has been fully remediated. Although the material weakness has been remediated, there can be no assurance that the internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us, as and when required, conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, as and when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. As a growing company, implementing and maintaining effective controls may require more resources, and we may encounter internal control integration difficulties. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We have experienced turnover in our senior management team, and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers. We have in the past and may in the future experience changes in our executive management team resulting from the departure of executives, which may be disruptive to our business. To continue to develop our pipeline and execute our strategy, we also must attract and retain highly skilled personnel in our industry. A failure by iBio to hire and retain an appropriately skilled and adequate workforce could adversely impact the ability to operate and function efficiently. iBio s operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain an appropriately skilled and sufficient workforce to operate our R D facility. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The R D facility is located in San Diego, California, a growing biotechnology hub and competition for skilled workers will continue to increase as the industry undergoes further growth in the area. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key personnel, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees especially in light of our cash position. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel as we grow in two locations may have a material adverse effect on our business. Use of our laboratory space in San Diego is critical to our success. A natural disaster or other disruptions at our laboratory would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations . We currently conduct all of our pre-clinical research at our laboratory in San Diego using specialized equipment that we have purchased. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facility due to fire, flood, earthquake, or any other unforeseen circumstance would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we 
 68 

Table of Contents 
 do believe that we could find alternative space in the case of a natural disaster, there can be no assurance that we will find suitable space near the location of our employees or that our equipment will survive a natural disaster. The occurrence of any disruption at our laboratory, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our research and development operations, during and after the period of the disruption. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our laboratory. We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. We intend to grow our business operations as demand increases and increase the number of our employees to accommodate such potential growth, which may cause us to experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This potential future growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including manufacturing operations, quality control, technical support and other administrative functions. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls. As our commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our capacity for manufacturing, customer service, billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. We may also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up and validate, and increase our manufacturing, maintenance, software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. These increases in scale, expansion of personnel, purchase of equipment or process enhancements may not be successfully implemented. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our partners or collaborators proprietary information, we may be subject to claims. The research and development processes developed by us or our partners or collaborators products are subject to trade secret protection, patents or other intellectual property protections owned or licensed by such partners. While we make significant efforts to protect our partners proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information, if any of our employees breaches the non-disclosure provisions in such agreements, or if our partners make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed, our reputation may suffer damage and we may become subject to legal proceedings that could require us to incur significant expenses and divert our management s time, attention and resources. If we acquire companies, products or technologies, we may face integration risks and costs associated with those acquisitions that could negatively impact our business, results from operations and financial condition. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. We may not realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition or investment. If we acquire companies or technologies, we will face risks, uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process, including difficulties in the integration of the operations of an acquired company, integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business, and impairment charges if future acquisitions are not as successful as we originally anticipate. In addition, our operating results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. Any failure to successfully integrate other companies, products, or technologies that we may acquire may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.

 Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stockholders will experience substantial dilution from the issuance of the development milestone payments if paid in equity and may not realize a benefit from the acquisition of substantially all of the assets RubrYc commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection therewith. We have the option to pay the contingent development milestone consideration owed to the RubrYc shareholders in shares of our common stock. Our stockholders will experience substantial dilution from the issuance of shares of common stock to pay the contingent development milestone consideration, should we elect to pay such development milestones in shares of common stock in lieu of cash. iBio is subject to compliance under the NYSE American continued listing standards of the NYSE American Company Guide, the failure of which can result in delisting from the NYSE American. In order to maintain its listing with NYSE American, we must remain in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in the NYSE American Company Guide (the Company Guide ), including the listing standard set forth in Section 1003 of the Guide, which applies if a listed company has stockholders equity below certain threshold amounts and has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. In the past, we have received notification of noncompliance with the continued listing requirements, which to date have been remediated There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all of the Exchange s continued listing standards, or exemptions therefrom, in the future. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock. Any additional issuance of common stock could have the effect of impeding or discouraging the acquisition of control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, including a transaction in which our stockholders would receive a premium over the market price for their shares, and thereby protect the continuity of our management. Specifically, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors were to determine that a takeover proposal was not in our best interest, shares could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval in one or more transactions that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of the takeover by: diluting the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder group, putting a substantial voting bloc in institutional or other hands that might undertake to support the incumbent Board of Directors, or effecting an acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover. 
 Our certificate of incorporation also allows our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors in the by-laws. Our certificate of incorporation does not contemplate cumulative voting in the election of directors and thus, under Delaware law, cumulative voting in the election of directors is not permitted. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered term of three years. This division of our Board of Directors could have the effect of impeding an attempt to take over our company or change or remove management, since only one class will be elected annually. Thus, only approximately one-third of the existing Board of Directors could be replaced at any election of directors.

 The effect of these provisions may be to delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may determine to be in his, her or its best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by the stockholders. Our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company s stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the forum selection provision does not apply to claims arising exclusively under the Exchange Act or the Investment Company Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder s ability to bring certain claims in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. If a court were to find this forum selection provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors may, at any time, designate a new series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock, and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the redemption of our common stock and authorize the issuance of such series of preferred stock, which may have a material adverse effect on the rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may, at any time, issue large blocks of preferred stock. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to designate and issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of our company and may prevent a transaction that is favorable to our stockholders. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset values could impact our business in the future. We and our third-party contract manufacturers, contract research organizations, and any clinical sites that may conduct our clinical trials in the future may also face disruptions in procuring items that are essential to our research and development activities, including, for example, medical and laboratory supplies used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies, in each case, that are sourced from abroad or for

 which there are shortages because of ongoing efforts to address the outbreak. These minor disruptions have had an immaterial effect on business, which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date. Further, although we have not experienced any material adverse effects on our business due to increasing inflation, it has raised operating costs for many businesses and, in the future, could impact demand or pricing manufacturing of our drug candidates or services providers, foreign exchange rates or employee wages. We are actively monitoring the effects these disruptions and increasing inflation could have on our operations. Our operations and performance depend on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. Russia s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from U.S. and European leaders. Resulting changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a trade war. The above factors, including a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the U.S. and abroad, could ultimately have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the following: effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures and significant income tax changes; supply chain disruptions; a global or regional economic slowdown in any of our market segments; changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers; industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether; new or stricter trade policies and tariffs enacted by countries, such as China, in response to changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs; postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors; rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation; difficulties protecting intellectual property; longer payment cycles; credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable; and the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements. 
 We rely extensively on our information technology systems and are vulnerable to damage and interruption We rely on our information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business, including maintaining client and supplier information. Additionally, we utilize third parties, including cloud providers, to store, transfer and process data. Our information technology systems, as well as the systems of our suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control, are vulnerable to outages and an increasing risk of continually evolving deliberate intrusions to gain access to company sensitive information. Likewise, data security incidents and breaches by employees and others with or without permitted access to our systems pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. A cyber-attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems, or those of our vendors, suppliers and other partners, could also result in disruptions in critical 
 72

 systems, corruption or loss of data and theft of data, funds or intellectual property. A security breach of any kind, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and attacks by hackers, employees or others, could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. We may be unable to prevent outages or security breaches in our systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats as, in some instances, we, our suppliers and our other partners may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our vendors or partners to cybersecurity attacks. Any or all of the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and our business reputation. Holders of our warrants issued in our offerings have no rights as common stockholders until they exercise their warrants and acquire our common stock. Until the holders of the warrants we issued in our offerings acquire shares of our common stock by exercising their warrants, the holders of the warrants have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares of common stock underlying their securities. Upon exercise of the warrants they will be entitled to the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date. Whether the outstanding warrants will have any value will depend on the market conditions for, and the price of, our common stock, which conditions will depend on factors related and unrelated to the success of our clinical development program, and cannot be predicted at this time. If our common stock price does not increase to an amount sufficiently above the exercise price of the warrants during the periods the warrants are exercisable, holders of warrants will be unable to recover any of their investment in the warrants. Because there is no established public trading market for any of our warrants we issued, the liquidity of each such security is limited. We do not expect a market to develop, nor do we intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange. Upon exercise of the warrants, our stockholders will experience dilution. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and adversely affected by various factors. Our stock price has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. By way of example, on September 11, 2023, the price of our common stock closed at 0.28 per share while on April 19, 2023, our stock price closed at 1.30 per share. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including: investor reaction to our business strategy; the success of competitive products or technologies; our continued compliance with the listing standards of the NYSE American; results of our preclinical and clinical trials; actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our products, clinical studies, manufacturing process or sales and marketing terms; variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products;

 our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it; declines in the market prices of stocks generally; trading volume of our common stock; sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; announcements of licensing or other business development initiatives; general economic, industry and market conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has been recently volatile and may be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. There can be no guarantee that our stock price will remain at current prices or that future sales of our common stock will not be at prices lower than those sold to investors. Reports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume. Securities research analysts, including those affiliated with our underwriters from prior offerings, establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage to continue going forward, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected . We are a smaller reporting company , and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. We may remain a smaller reporting company until we have a non-affiliate public float in excess of 250 million or annual revenues in excess of 100 million and a non-affiliate public float in excess of 700 million, each as determined on an annual basis. For so long as we remain smaller reporting company, we are permitted and may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; and scaled reporting and disclosure requirements including about our executive compensation arrangements.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the notes thereto and other information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Report to iBio, the Company, we, us, or our and similar terms mean iBio, Inc. Overview We are a pioneering biotechnology company at the intersection of AI and biologics, committed to reshaping the landscape of discovery. Our core mission is to harness the potential of AI and machine learning to unveil elusive biologics that stand out and have evaded other scientists. Through our innovative platform, we champion a culture of innovation by identifying novel targets, forging strategic collaborations to enhance efficiency, diversify pipelines, and with the goal of accelerating preclinical processes. Additionally, our groundbreaking EngageTx technology enables us to target bi-specific molecules. With the ability to navigate sequence diversity and promote Human-Cyno cross reactivity while mitigating cytokine release, our goal is to enhance agility and bolster preclinical safety assessments. Our strategic approach to fulfilling our mission is outlined as follows: Elevate Epitope Discovery: We believe we lead the field with our patented AI-engine uncovering hard to develop molecules. Our unparalleled epitope engine stands out by allowing the ability to target select regions of a protein, potentially removing the lengthy trial and error out of mAb discovery. This capability is expected to improve probability of success while at the same time, reduces costs commonly caused by having an iterative process. Our epitope engine is engineered to match its target, refined for stability and optimized for water solubility; allowing us to identify new drug candidates that have failed or have been abandoned due to their complexity. Capital efficient business approach: Our strategic business approach is structured around the following pillars of value creation: o Strategic Collaborations : We are leveraging our platform and pipeline by forming strategic partnerships. Our aim is to become the preferred partner for major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking rapid and cost-effective integration of complex molecules into their portfolios, de-risking their early-stage pre-clinical work. Additionally, a rich array of fast follower molecules within our pre-clinical pipeline holds the potential to drive substantial partnerships, opening doors to innovative projects. By tapping into our platform, infrastructure, and expertise, partners have the potential to streamline timelines, reduce costs tied to biologic drug discovery applications and cell line process development, and expedite preclinical programs with efficiency. o Developing and advancing our in-house programs cost effectively : Clinical advancement is crucial for drug discovery. We are actively looking for opportunities to progress our internal pre-clinical programs, with a focal point on oncology, steadily reinforcing our pre-clinical pipeline. o Tech Licensing in Diverse Therapeutic Areas: In pursuit of adding value, we are exploring partnerships in diverse therapeutic domains such as CNS or vaccines. Our intention is to license the AI tech stack, extending its benefits to our partners and amplifying its biological impact and insights. This strategic approach enables us to capitalize on the value of our meticulously curated data while empowering collaborations and innovations, while at the same time allowing us to focus on both the platform and our core therapeutic area, oncology.

 Unwavering Investment in advancing the platform: We maintain an unwavering commitment to invest in our platform, continually unlocking the potential of biology through AI and machine learning. The pinnacle of being on the forefront of machine learning advancing algorithms, and models in order to improve its predictive power and reduce the time it takes to find a viable molecule. 
 In essence, we are sculpting a future where cutting-edge AI-driven biotechnology propels the discovery of intricate biologics, fostering partnerships, accelerating innovation, and propelling the advancement of science. AI-Technology Platform Overview Our platform comprises four key components, each playing a crucial role in the discovery and optimization of precision antibodies. The first layer, epitope engineering, leverages the patented AI-engine to target specific regions of proteins, allowing us to engineer antibodies with high specificity and efficacy. The second layer involves the proprietary antibody library, which is built on clinically validated frameworks and offers a rich diversity of human antibodies. The third layer of the technology stack is the antibody optimizing StableHu AI technology, coupled with mammalian display technology. Finally, our EngageTx platform forms the fourth layer. Each layer of the tech stack is designed to work synergistically, enabling us to rapidly advance antibodies from concept to in vivo proof-of-concept (POC). AI Epitope Steering Technology Our epitope steering technology is designed to address these issues by guiding antibodies exclusively against the desired regions of the target protein. By focusing on these specific regions, we can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our antibody discovery process. Our AI engine creates engineered epitopes, which are small embodiments of epitopes on the target protein. The engine is trained to match the epitope structure as closely as possible and refine the designs for greater stability and water solubility, which are critically important factors. The optimized engineered epitope is then used to identify antibodies from na ve or immunized libraries. Na ve Human Antibody Library The fully human antibody library is built upon clinically validated, entirely human antibody frameworks. By leveraging public databases, we have extracted a diverse array of Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequences. Subsequently, we have meticulously eliminated a range of sequence liabilities. Such careful curation process could potentially significantly reduce the development risk for antibodies identified from our library. StableHu TM AI Antibody-Optimizing Technology Our proprietary StableHu technology is instrumental in the optimization process. StableHu is an AI-powered tool designed to predict a library of antibodies with fully human CDR variants based on an input antibody. This input can range from an early, unoptimized molecule to an approved drug. The model has been trained utilizing a set of over 1 billion human antibodies, progressively masking known amino acids within CDRs until the algorithm could predict the correct human sequence. While phage display libraries are often used in antibody optimization due to their vast diversity, they can increase developability risks such as low expression, instability, or aggregation of antibodies. Mammalian display libraries, on the other hand, offer significantly improved developability but reduced diversity due to the smaller library size they can handle. StableHu overcomes this limitation by utilizing a machine learning algorithm generating focused library diversity within the capacity of mammalian display. Mammalian display is a technology that presents antibodies on the surface of mammalian cells, allowing for the direct screening and selection of antibodies in a mammalian cell environment. This approach is advantageous as antibodies that 
 79 

Table of Contents 
 express well on the mammalian cells used in the display are more likely to express well in the production cell line. Moreover, single-cell sorting of antibody-displaying cells allows rapid selection of desired antibodies based on multiple dimensions, such as potency, selectivity, and cross-species selectivity. When paired with mammalian display technology, StableHu enables antibody optimization with fewer iterative optimization steps, lower immunogenicity risk, and improved developability. EngageTx CD3-Based T-Cell Engager Panel We have used antibodies from an epitope steering campaign as well as a first-generation T-cell engager as input and utilized our StableHu technology to identify a next-generation CD3 antibody panel. The sequence diversity generated by StableHu led to an antibody panel with a wide range of potencies, which allows us to pair the panel with a wide variety of tumor-targeting antibodies. Importantly, we were able to retain T-cell activation and tumor cell killing capacity with significantly reduced cytokine release. This reduction is believed to lower the risk of cytokine release syndrome. Additionally, the increased humanness of the predicted antibodies, thanks to our StableHu technology, reduces the risk of immunogenicity. Furthermore, our StableHu technology enabled us to engineer NHP cross-reactivity into EngageTx. This allows for advanced safety assessment in NHP ahead of clinical trials, providing another layer of safety assurance. Pre-Clinical Pipeline We are currently in the process of building and advancing our preclinical pipeline. The focus of our pipeline is primarily on immuno-oncology, with one program also dedicated to the immunology space. By leveraging our technology stack, the pipeline is geared towards hard-to-drug targets and molecules offering differentiation. To mitigate target risk and capitalize on the learnings of competitors, our programs are primarily adopting a fast follower strategy. This approach allows us to focus on targets that have to some extent been validated and learn from the advancements of those ahead in the field. Recent Developments On September 15, 2023, iBio CDMO entered into the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Majestic Realty Co., pursuant to which iBio CDMO agreed to sell to Majestic Realty for a purchase price of 17,250,000 its Facility located in Bryan, TX consisting of: (i) the ground leasehold estate and interest held under the Ground Lease Agreement, dated March 8, 2010, as amended by an Estoppel Certificate and Amendment to Ground Lease Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2015, between iBio CDMO (as assignee from College Station Investors LLC) and The Board of Regents of the Texas A M University System (together, the Ground Lease ), related to 21.401 acres in Brazos County, Texas land (the Land (ii) the buildings, parking areas, improvements, and fixtures situated on the Land (the Improvements (iii) all iBio CDMO s right, title, and interest in and to furniture, personal property, machinery, apparatus, and equipment owned and currently

 used in the operation, repair and maintenance of the Land and Improvements and situated thereon (collectively, the Personal Property (iii) all iBio CDMO s rights under the contracts and agreements relating to the operation or maintenance of the Land, Improvements or Personal Property which extend beyond the closing date (the Contracts and (iv) all iBio CDMO s rights in intangible assets of any nature relating to any or all of the Land, the Improvements and the Personal Property (the Intangibles and together with the Ground Lease, Improvements and Personal Property, collectively, the Property ). The closing of the sale of the Property is to occur, with time being of the essence, on December 1, 2023 or such other date as mutually agreed. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Majestic Realty deposited with a title company (the Escrow Agent 200,000 as an earnest money deposit. Majestic Realty will also be afforded access to the Property to conduct a due diligence review of its condition. The closing is subject to certain closing conditions, including: (i) Majestic Realty s delivery to iBio CDMO and the Escrow Agent of written notice of its approval of the condition of the Property on or before 5:00 p.m. Central time on October 16, 2023; (ii) Majestic Realty obtaining the approval of The Board of Regents of the Texas A M University System of Majestic Realty s purchase from it of the fee interest in the Land on or before 5:00 p.m. Central time on November 13, 2023; and (iii) the delivery at closing by the title company of a title policy to Majestic Realty in the amount of the Purchase Price. Results of Operations Revenue Revenue from the CDMO operations is now included in discontinued operations and not broken out separately on the financial statements. Our ongoing business is primarily focused on i) development of our pipeline for which we do not expect revenue for many years, if at all, and ii) on our AI-driven discovery platform for which to date we have not generated any material revenue. We may have revenue with the AI-driven discovery platform in the future. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we reported no revenue. Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2022 was mainly related to a licensing agreement. Research and Development Expenses R D R D expenses for Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and Fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 were approximately 10.3 million and 9.8 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 0.5 million or 5 . The increase primarily related to the increase in activities related to our internal pipeline including IBIO-101, CCR8, and EGFRvIII, and the expansion of our AI-driven discovery platform to include an increased spend of approximately 1.7 million on lab supplies, lab equipment/maintenance, and facility rent for the San Diego facility and an increase of approximately 0.6 million in R D personnel at the San Diego center. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately 1.8 million in spend on consultants and contracted services. iBio anticipates R D expenses in Fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 will be close to those of Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. R D expenses relating to CDMO operations are captured separately under discontinued operations. General and Administrative Expenses G A G A expenses for Fiscal year ended June 30 2023 and Fiscal year ended June 30 2022 were approximately 19.0 million and 21.8 million, respectively, a decrease of 2.8) million or (13) . G A expenses principally include officer and employee salaries and benefits, depreciation and amortization, professional fees, consulting services, operational costs and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company. The decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in intangible asset impairment charges and related amortization of 1.5) million, a reduction of legal fees expense of 0.8) million, a reduction in profession/consulting fees and outside services of 0.8) million, and reduced travel of 0.2) million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 0.5) million for IT security and related costs. iBio expects G A expenses to continue to decrease in Fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

 Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses, consisting primarily of R D and G A expenses, for Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were approximately 29.3 million, compared to approximately 31.6 million for Fiscal ended June 30, 2022. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) for Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and Fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was approximately 0.03 million and 0.2 million, a decrease of approximately 0.2) million. The minimal increase in interest income was offset by interest expenses and loss on sale of debt securities for a total other income (expense) of approximately 0.03 million. Net Loss Available to iBio, Inc. Stockholders from Continuing Operations Net loss available to iBio, Inc. stockholders from continuing operations for Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was approximately 29.3) million, or 2.39) per share, compared to approximately 29.6) million, or 3.39) per share, in 2022. Discontinued Operations On November 2, 2022, we announced our plans to divest our contract development and manufacturing organization (iBio CDMO, LLC) in order to complete our transformation into an AI-driven, precision antibody drug discovery and development company. In conjunction with the restructuring, we completed a workforce reduction of approximately 60 and discontinued the CDMO operations. CDMO operations are reported as discontinued operations on our financial statements. Losses for Discontinued Operations for 2023 and 2022 were approximately 35.7) million and 20.8) million, respectively, an increase of 14.9) million, or 72 . This increase was primarily due to the impairment of fixed assets 17.9) million, impairment of consumable inventory of 4.9) million, and 3.1) million of personnel restructuring related charges including severance, benefits and the acceleration of stock compensation awards. This increase in expense was offset by the decrease of Facility related expenses of 4.5) million, personnel costs of 3.6) million, consultant/outside services of 1.5) million, the gain on sale of fixed assets of 0.8) million and the 0.6) million forgiveness of the PPP loan in Fiscal year 2022, which did not reoccur in Fiscal year 2023. Total Net Loss Available to iBio, Inc. Stockholders Net loss available to iBio, Inc. stockholders from both continuing and discontinued operations for Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was approximately 65.0) million, or 5.31) per share, compared to approximately 50.4) million, or 5.78) per share, in Fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources The history of significant losses, the negative cash flow from operations, the limited cash resources on hand and the dependence by the Company on its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its operations after the current cash resources are exhausted raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our management concluded that our recurring losses from operations and the fact that we have not generated significant revenue or positive cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months after issuance of our financial statements. Our auditors also included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023 with respect to this uncertainty. In an effort to remain a going concern and increase cash reserves, we completed a public offering in December 2022, reduced our work force by approximately 60 (a reduction of approximately 69 positions) in November 2022, and ceased operations of our CDMO Facility thereby reducing annual spend on expenses by approximately 67 and generating cash savings of approximately 64 from first quarter Fiscal year 2023 compared to fourth quarter Fiscal year 2023. Additionally, we have executed the Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the CDMO Facility, which sale if consummated will allow us to pay all outstanding amounts under the Term Loan; however, the consummation of the sale

 is subject to closing conditions for which there can be no assurance that they will be met or the closing will occur in a timely manner, if at all . If the closing is not consummated prior to the December 31, 2023 maturity date of the Term Loan it is unlikely that we will have sufficient funds the repay the Term Loan on its maturity date, which Term Loan has an outstanding balance of which is 12.7 million as of September 26, 2023. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed at-the-market offerings and sold 175,973 shares of our common stock, par value .001 per share (the Common Stock for net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed a public offering and raised gross proceeds of approximately 3.5 million selling an aggregate of 3,365,385 shares of its Common Stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof), Series A warrants to purchase up to 3,870,192 shares of Common Stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 3,870,192 shares of Common Stock. Subsequently after the public offering, during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, 341,300 Class A Warrants and 1,704,916 Class B Warrants were exercised for total proceeds of 2,128,000. Also, during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed at-the-market offerings and sold 1,375,906 shares of Common Stock for which we received approximately 2.0 million. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, an additional 76,300 Class B Warrants were exercised with total proceeds of approximately 79,000. Also, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed at-the-market offerings and sold 4,230,992 shares of Common Stock of which we received approximately 3.3 million and holds a subscription receivable for 204,000 at June 30, 2023 for proceeds received on July 6, 2023. (See Note 17 Stockholder s Equity for more information.) Subsequent to June 30, 2023, we completed at-the-market offerings and sold 3,419,795 shares of Common Stock which we received approximately 1.7 million. We also sold 3,622,834 shares of Common Stock under our Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park and received approximately 1.2 million in proceeds. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 7.6 million as of June 30, 2023, is not anticipated to be sufficient to support operations through the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, unless we further reduce our burn rate, consummate the sale of the Facility for amounts above the debt on the Facility, or increase our capital as described above. Regardless of whether we are able to reduce our burn rate or sell or out-license certain assets or parts of the business, we will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute our longer-term business plan. It is our goal to implement one or more potential options described herein to allow us to have a cash runway for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing any of the options that we are evaluating. Our liquidity and operations could also be impacted by our obligations under the Woodforest Credit Agreement. As described below and in detail in Note 6 - Significant Transactions, to avoid violating the Liquidity Covenant associated with the parent guarantee of the debt, we need to pay off the debt through the sale of the Facility or we need to raise additional capital. Woodforest Debt On October 11, 2022, we and Woodforest entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which the Credit Agreement was amended to: (i) include a payment of 5,500,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement on the date of the amendment, (ii) include a payment of 5,100,000 of the outstanding principal balance owed under the Credit Agreement within two (2) business days upon our receipt of such amount owed to us by Fraunhofer as part of our legal settlement with them (see Item 3 Legal Proceedings for more information), (iii) include principal payments of 250,000 per month in debt amortization for a six-month period commencing the date of the amendment through March 2023, (iv) include an amendment fee of 22,375 and all costs and expenses, (v) require delivery of a report detailing cash flow expenditures every two (2) weeks for the period prior to the delivery of the last report and a monthly 12-month forecast (vi) reduce the liquidity covenant in the Guaranty (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from 10 million to 7.5 million with the ability to lower the liquidity covenant to 5.0 million upon the occurrence of a specific milestone in the Credit Agreement, and (vii) change the annual filing requirement solely for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, such that the filing is acceptable with or without a going concern designation. In addition, Woodforest cancelled the irrevocable letter of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank upon closing of the amendment.

 In January 2023, iBio s unrestricted cash decreased below the required 7,500,000, which created an event of default under the Credit Agreement and Guaranty as a result of not complying with the Liquidity Covenant. As a result, on February 9, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment ), which amended, among other things, added a milestone that had to be met by a specified date, the failure of which would be an event of default. In addition, on February 9, 2023, iBio, as guarantor, entered into a second amendment to the Guaranty, which amended, among other things, allowed iBio to account for the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds in determining whether the Company is in compliance with the Liquidity Covenant until a specified period dependent upon the occurrence of a specific milestone in the Credit Agreement. On February 20, 2023, iBio CDMO entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment ), which removed the added milestone specified in the Second Amendment, the failure of which would be an event of default.

In addition, we agreed that each time it consummates an at-the-market issuance of Equity Interests (as defined within the Credit Agreement), no later than five (5) days following such issuance of Equity Interests, it will (i) pay to Woodforest in immediately available cash funds, without setoff or counterclaim of any kind, forty percent (40 of the Net Proceeds (as defined within the Credit Agreement) received by us for such issuance of Equity Interests; provided, any such payment would cease upon payment obligations in full and (ii) provide Woodforest with a detailed accounting of each such issuance of Equity Interests. On March 24, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a fourth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fourth Amendment ), which within the Fourth Amendment Woodforest agreed to (i) reduce the percentage of any payment to Woodforest we are required to make from the proceeds of sales of our common stock under its at-the-market facility from 40 to 20 , (ii) reduce the percentage of any payment to Woodforest we are required to make from the proceeds of sales of its equipment from 40 to 20 , and (iii) allowed us to retain 2,000,000 million of the 5,100,000 million that we received from the Fraunhofer Settlement Funds, with the remaining 3,000,000 million being held in our account at Woodforest. In addition, we are obligated to (y) deliver to Woodforest an executed copy of a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement for the sale of the Facility, no later than April 14, 2023, and (z) pay to Woodforest a fee in the amount of 75,000 on the earlier of the date of the closing of the Purchase Agreement, or the Maturity Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement). In addition, on March 24, 2023, iBio, as guarantor, entered into a fourth amendment to the Guaranty, which reduced the Liquidity Covenant from 7,500,000 to 1,000,000. On May 10, 2023, iBio CDMO and Woodforest entered into a fifth amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment ), which within the Fifth Amendment Woodforest agreed to: (i) waive our obligation to deliver to Woodforest an executed copy of a Purchase Agreement for the sale of the Facility no later than April 14, 2023 and, (ii) release 500,000 of the 3.0 million being held in our account at Woodforest when the outstanding principal amount is reduced to 10.0 million and for each additional 2.5 million reduction of the outstanding principal amount, an additional 750,00 will be released from our account at Woodforest. In addition, starting on the effective date of the Fifth Amendment, the interest on the Term Loan increased to 5.25 , and the Term Loan shall further accrue interest, payable in kind and added to the balance of the outstanding principal amount at a fixed rate per annum equal to (a) 1.00 , if the Facility is sold on or before June 30, 2023, (b) 2.00 if the Facility is sold after June 2023, but on or before September 30, 2023, or (c) 3:00 , if the Facility is sold after September 30, 2023, or not sold prior to the Maturity Date.

 Amendment, and (z) if the Facility is not sold on or before December 1, 2023, iBio CDMO will pay a fee in the amount of 20,000 upon the earlier of the date of the closing or the maturity date. Cantor Fitzgerald Underwriting On November 25, 2020, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor Fitzgerald to sell shares of Common Stock, from time to time, through an at the market offering program having an aggregate offering price of up to 100,000,000 through which Cantor Fitzgerald would act as sales agent.

Lincoln Park Stock Purchase Agreement On August 4, 2023, iBio entered into a purchase agreement, dated as of August 4, 2023 (the Purchase Agreement ), with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC Lincoln Park ), pursuant to which, under the terms and subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions set forth therein, we may sell to Lincoln Park up to 10.0 million (subject to certain limitations) of Common Stock, from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, on August 4, 2023, we entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of August 4, 2023 (the Registration Rights Agreement ), with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC, to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), the resale by Lincoln Park of shares of Common Stock that have been or may be issued and sold by us to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. We cannot sell any shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement unless all of the conditions to Lincoln Park s purchase obligation set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including that the resale registration statement that we are required to file with the SEC under the Registration Rights Agreement is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus relating thereto is filed with the SEC (the date on which all of such conditions are satisfied, the Commencement Date ). The registration statement was declared effective on August 11, 2023. Beginning on the Commencement Date and for a period of up to 24 months thereafter, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, from time to time, at our discretion, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase, up to 10 million of shares of Common Stock, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Specifically, from time to time from and after the Commencement Date, we may, at our discretion, on any single business day on which the closing price of the common stock on the NYSE American is equal to or greater than 0.15, by written notice delivered to Lincoln Park, direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Common Stock on such business day, at a purchase price per share that will be determined and fixed in accordance with the Purchase Agreement at the time the Company delivers such written notice to Lincoln Park (each, a Regular Purchase provided , however , that the maximum number of shares we may sell to Lincoln Park in a Regular Purchase may be increased to up to (i) 150,000 shares, if the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the NYSE American on the applicable purchase date is not below 1.00, and (ii) 200,000 shares, if the closing sale price of the Common Stock on the applicable purchase date is not below 2.00; provided , however , that Lincoln Park s maximum purchase commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed 500,000. The foregoing share amounts and per share prices will be adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction occurring after the date of the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Common Stock. The purchase price per share of Common Stock sold in each such Regular Purchase, if any, will be based on market prices of the Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale, calculated as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, provided that we have directed Lincoln Park to purchase the maximum amount of shares that we are then able to sell to Lincoln Park in a Regular Purchase on a particular business day on which the closing price of the common stock on the NYSE American is equal to or greater than 0.20, then in addition to such Regular Purchase, we may, in our sole discretion, also direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in an accelerated purchase, and one or more additional accelerated purchases on the business day immediately following the purchase date for such Regular Purchase, as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share of Common Stock sold to Lincoln Park in

 each accelerated purchase and additional accelerated purchase, if any, will be based on market prices of the Common Stock at the time of sale on the applicable purchase date for such accelerated purchase and such additional accelerated purchase(s), as applicable, calculated as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. There are no upper limits on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for shares of Common Stock in any purchase under the Purchase Agreement. We will control the timing and amount of any sales of Common Stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park has no right to require the Company to sell any shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park, but Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as we direct, subject to certain conditions. Actual sales of shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, market prices of the Common Stock from time to time during the term of the Purchase Agreement and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for iBio and its operations. The net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to iBio will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park. We expect that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As consideration for Lincoln Park s commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock at our direction pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we issued 211,473 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares (the Initial Commitment Shares and agreed to issue 211,474 additional shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares (the Additional Commitment Shares and, collectively with the Initial Commitment Shares, the Commitment Shares at such time as we have received an aggregate of 5,000,000 in cash proceeds from Lincoln Park from sales of Common Stock to Lincoln Park, if any, that we elect, in our sole discretion, to make from time to time from and after the Commencement Date, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. (See Note 17 - Stockholders Equity for more detail.) Between August 16, 2023 and September 15, 2023, Lincoln Park purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement 3,622,834 shares of Common Stock. The Company received net proceeds of approximately 1.2 million during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. Net Cash Used in Operating Activities In fiscal year 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 30.4) million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 37.5) million in 2022. The decrease in net cash was primarily used to support our ongoing operations. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities In fiscal year 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 7.0 million, which primarily consisted of redemption and sales of debt securities of 10.8 million and the sale of fixed asset of 2.6 million, partially offset by the purchase of 5.7) million of fixed assets and 0.7) million for certain assets acquired from RubrYc. Offset by proceeds from the sales of fixed assets. In fiscal year 2022, our net cash used in investing activities was 5.1) million, which primarily consisted of the purchase of RubrYc equity and acquisition of intangible assets related to our license of IBIO-101, and purchases of fixed assets, offset by the net redemption of debt securities. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities In fiscal year 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 2.3 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 6.1) million in 2022. Net cash generated from financing activities in 2023 primarily related to proceeds from sales of common stock offset by payments made towards term note payable while the net cash spent in 2022 mainly related to the purchase of the Facility. Funding Requirements We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our spin-off from Integrated BioPharma in August 2008. As of June 30, 2023, our accumulated deficit was approximately 288.9) million, and we used approximately 21.1) million of net cash in fiscal year 2023.

 We plan to fund our future business operations using cash on hand, through proceeds realized in connection with the commercialization of our technologies, through proceeds from the sale of the CDMO Facility, through potential proceeds from the sale or out-licensing of assets, and through proceeds from the sale of additional equity or other securities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these plans, many of which will take several years before we realize proceeds. The Term Loan with Woodforest and the Guaranty requires we maintain an unrestricted cash balance of 1.0 million, which limits our ability to use our funds for operations. If we should default on the Credit Agreement and Woodforest does not waive the default, and if Woodforest makes a demand for the acceleration of all payments due to this default, it could result in all obligations that are guaranteed being due and payable immediately without further notice. We cannot be certain that such funding will be available on favorable terms or available at all. If we are unable to raise funds when required or on favorable terms, this assumption may no longer be operative, and we may have to: a) significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the product application and/or commercialization of our proprietary technologies; b) seek collaborators for our technology and product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; c) relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates, or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize; or d) possibly cease operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually limited purposes. As of June 30, 2023, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. Critical Accounting Estimates A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). All applicable U.S. GAAP accounting standards effective as of June 30, 2023, have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Some of those estimates are subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. We base our estimates, to the extent possible, on historical experience. Historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary. Actual results could differ from our estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S. GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The following accounting estimate had a material impact on the results of operations of the Company for the year ended June 30, 2023. Impairment of Fixed Assets We monitor fixed assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. When necessary, charges for impairments of long-lived assets are recorded for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Changes in the Company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these estimates. On November 3, 2022, we announced we are seeking to divest our contract development and manufacturing organization (iBio CDMO) in order to complete our transformation into an antibody discovery and development company. Through the process of seeking to divest its contract development and manufacturing organization, we have entered into a Purchase

 and Sale Agreement for the Facility. The decision to divest triggered a quantitative impairment analysis of our CDMO fixed assets of the Facility totaling 22.65 million and machinery and equipment totaling 13.4 million. We utilized a market approach in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, using independent third-party appraisals, including comparable assets, in addition to bids received from prospective buyers, to estimate the fair value of the Facility, the machinery and equipment. We recorded an impairment charge of 6.3 million for the facility and 11.3 million for the machinery and equipment in the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The key assumption in the valuation analysis is the expected sale price of 21.1 million for the Facility and the associated machinery and equipment less approximate costs to sell of 2.7 million. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, we entered into an agreement for the sale of the Facility for 17.25 million, and an additional impairment of 0.3 million was recorded in Fiscal 2023 to reflect the agreed upon sales price less estimated costs to sell. The carrying amount of the CDMO fixed assets after impairment on June 30, 2023 was 16.1 million. On February 10, 2021, the Company, entered into an Auction Sale Agreement (the Auction Sale Agreement with Holland Industrial Group, together with Federal Equipment Company and Capital Recovery Group LLC (collectively, the Auctioneers for the sale at public auction of equipment and other tangible personal property (the Equipment located at the Facility. The Auctioneer guaranteed an amount of gross proceeds from the sale of the equipment of 2.1 million, which was paid to the Company on February 17, 2023. The auction, which commenced on March 24, 2023 and concluded on March 30, 2023, resulted in total proceeds of approximately 2.9 million. In accordance with the Auction Sale Agreement, the Company received 80 of the excess proceeds, after Holland was paid a fixed amount of 0.2 million for expenses, which was approximately 0.5 million. We may have to record a further, potentially material, impairment to the fair value of this asset group if we do not realize a sale transaction for the expected amount of 17.25 million less costs to sell in the near term. Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets For indefinite life intangible assets, we perform an impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Evaluating for impairment requires judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur. Changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these estimates. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, we performed our annual impairment testing of the IBIO-101 therapeutic technology (or IP ), classified as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which had a carrying amount of 5 million at June 30, 2023. We engaged a third party to perform valuation assistance with estimating the fair value of IBIO-101 and preparing a market capitalization reconciliation. The Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method MPEEM under the income approach was utilized to value the indefinite-lived asset. The MPEEM determines the value of a specified asset by calculating the present value of future earnings attributed to the asset. Since IBIO-101 is currently in its pre-clinical development phase, a probability of success was applied to the cash flows to account for the probability of reaching each step of development. The MPEEM requires that charges for the use of other contributory assets be subtracted under the theory that the owner of the subject asset does not own the other contributory assets and would have to rent/lease them in order to earn the cash flows related to the subject asset. The resulting probability of success adjusted excess earnings were discounted to the present value using a 13 discount rate, which was based on iBio s weighted average cost of capital. The sum of the discounted excess earnings and the present value of the tax benefit related to amortization of the IBIO-101 indefinite-lived intangible indicated that the fair value was 7.1 million as of the April 1, 2023, valuation date. Given that the carrying amount of the asset was 5 million at June 30, 2023, it was concluded that no impairment existed.

 We will continue to monitor the value of the IP, since we believe it is at risk for impairment. The primary impairment indicators that may arise in the near future are (1) any sustained decline in our common stock market price and (2) FDA decisions on similar competing technologies that are applying for Phase 1 approval. We continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, rising interest rates (and cost of capital) and experience liquidity challenges. Accordingly, we may have to adjust our cash flow projections and valuation assumptions in the near future to account for market trends and any changes to our research and development plans. Any such future adjustments may lead to material future impairments in the IP and other related assets. Our remaining critical accounting estimates remain consistent with the information disclosed in the same section in our last annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates, the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; legal and contractual contingencies; research and development expenses; and share-based compensation expenses. We base our estimates, to the extent possible, on historical experience. Historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary. Actual results could differ from our estimates. See Note 4 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The information under this Item is not required to be provided by smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Financial statements and notes thereto appear on pages F-1 to F-44 of this Annual Report. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Financial Officer) have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended), as of June 30, 2023. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such 
 90 

Table of Contents 
 information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting It is the responsibility of the management of iBio to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to iBio s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. iBio s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of iBio; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of iBio are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of iBio; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of iBio s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of iBio. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of iBio s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based upon criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We remediated the material weakness relating to our internal controls over the accounting for stock-based compensation, as described below. Except as otherwise described herein, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Controls over Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We strengthened our internal controls over accounting for stock-based compensation through designing and implementing additional procedures and controls over stock-based compensation. Management believes that significant progress has been made in enhancing internal controls as of June 30, 2023 and has concluded that the enhanced controls are operating effectively. The material weakness described in in Item 4 Controls and Procedures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 has been fully remediated. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm This Annual Report does not include an attestation report by CohnReznick LLP CohnReznick ), our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of iBio, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of iBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 and has an accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2023. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit

 matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Asset Purchase Agreement Critical Audit Matter Description As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, on September 16, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with RubrYc Therapeutics, Inc. RubrYc ). The Company accounted for this agreement as an asset purchase and allocated the consideration to the various assets acquired. The financial reporting for the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement (the Agreement involved significant estimation by management in its determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and the related fair value allocation of the Agreement. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments of the fair value of the assets acquired and related fair value allocation related to the Agreement was challenging, subjective, and complex and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company s financial reporting for the Agreement included, among others: We obtained an understanding of and evaluated the design and implementation of controls that address the risk of material misstatement for the financial reporting for asset acquisitions. We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to asset acquisitions for reasonableness. We evaluated the reasonableness of the assets acquired included within the Agreement. We verified the total consideration included among the terms of the Agreement. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing the Company s methodology and significant assumptions used to fair value the assets acquired. We utilized our valuation specialists who performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value allocation of the assets acquired resulting from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the Company s allocation of total consideration to the assets acquired. We evaluated the Company s relevant financial statement presentation and disclosures for consistency with our knowledge of the terms of the Agreement and with accounting standards. Acquired License Impairment Assessment As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired an indefinite-lived license of approximately 5.003 million. This asset is assessed for impairment at least annually and upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for indefinite life licenses consists of comparing the fair value, which is estimated using the income approach, to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. The determination of the fair value is primarily based on discounted future cash flows projected to be generated from the license, including the estimates of future revenue, future development costs, the probability of success in various phases of development programs, and potential post-launch cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charges, or both. Significant judgment is exercised by management when developing the fair value measurement of the license. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments of the fair value of the acquired license was challenging, subjective, and complex and required a high degree of auditor judgment.

 How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company s financial reporting relating to potential impairment of the license included, among others: We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls over the Company s process for indefinite-lived intangible impairment assessments. We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to impairment of the acquired license intangible for reasonableness. We tested management s process for developing the fair value of the license. Through the use of internal valuation specialists, we assessed the appropriateness and consistency of the discounted cash flow analyses model. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing the Company s methodology and significant assumptions used amongst the Company s impairment assessment. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing the Company s market capitalization reconciliation associated with the Company s impairment assessment. We utilized our valuation specialists who performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the Company s impairment assessment resulting from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the significant assumptions related to future revenue, future development costs, and the probability of success in various phases of development programs as well as post launch cash flows. In evaluating management s significant assumptions for reasonableness, we considered consistency with external market and industry data and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We assessed the sensitivity of changes in estimating the fair value in comparison to the carrying value for reasonableness. Assets Held for Sale As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has Assets Held for Sale of approximately 18.065 million. Assets held for sale shall be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. A loss shall be recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less costs to sell. The determination of fair value less costs to sell is based on a combination of appraisal of the respective building and associated land, discussions with the Company engaged brokers and estimated closing costs on any potential sale of the assets held for sale. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charges, or both. Significant judgment is exercised by management when developing the fair value less costs to sell analysis related to the assets held for sale. Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments of the fair value less costs to sell was challenging, subjective and complex and required a high degree of auditor judgement. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company s financial reporting relating to impairment of the assets held for sale included, among others: We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design and implementation of internal controls over the Company s process for impairment assessments regarding assets held for sale. We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to impairment of the Company s assets held for sale. We tested management s process for developing the fair value estimates regarding the assets held for sale. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing the Company s methodology and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of the assets held for sale. We tested management s process for developing the estimated costs to sell the assets held for sale. In evaluating management s significant assumptions for reasonableness, we considered consistency with external market data and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

 million as of September 26, 2023. Additionally, in July 2022, the Company initiated the selling of the CDMO assets and facility, and since then has sold a substantial portion of the CDMO assets. (See Note 3 Discontinued Operations for more information.) The Company s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately million as of June 30, 2023, is not anticipated to be sufficient to support operations through the second quarter of Fiscal 2024 unless the Company reduces its burn rate further, sells the CDMO Facility for amounts above its term note payable or increases its capital as described above. Regardless of whether the Company is able to reduce its burn rate or sell or out-license certain assets or parts of the business, the Company will need to raise additional capital in order to fully execute its longer-term business plan. It is the Company s goal to implement one or more potential options described above to allow the Company to have a cash runway for at least 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in implementing any of the options that it is evaluating. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Reverse Stock Split On September 22, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved the implementation of a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty five 1 : 25) shares of the Company s Common Stock. The reverse stock split was effective as of October 7, 2022. All share and per share amounts of our common stock presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one -for-twenty five reverse stock split.

 . The Company reviews the carrying value of its definite life intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. The carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds it fair value. For indefinite life intangible assets, the Company performs an impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company determines the fair value of the asset quarterly or when triggering events are present, based on discounted cash flows and records an impairment loss if book value exceeds fair value. Evaluating for impairment requires judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur. Changes in the Company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these estimates.
