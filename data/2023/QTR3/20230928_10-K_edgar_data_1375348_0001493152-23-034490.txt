1. BUSINESS 

General 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada
on April 21, 2006. We are an exploration stage corporation. An exploration stage corporation is one engaged in the search for
mineral deposits or reserves which are not in either development or production stages. We maintain our statutory registered agent s
office at The Corporation Trust Company of Nevada, 6100 Neil Road, Suite 500, Reno, Nevada 89511. Our business office is located
at #300 500 North Rainbow Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89107. This is our mailing address as well. Our telephone number (210)
862-3372. Ms. Miller, our secretary/treasurer, provides our office space on a rent-free basis. 

We
have no revenues, have achieved losses since inception, have no operations, have been issued a going concern opinion and rely
upon the sale of our securities and loans from our officers and directors to fund operations. 

We
have no plans to change our business activities or to combine with another business. We are not aware of any events or circumstances
that might cause us to change our plans. 

Background 

We
are an exploration stage mining company, incorporated in Nevada. 

The
Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining
claims. Upon location of a commercial minable reserve, the Company expects to actively prepare the site for its extraction and
enter a development stage. 

On
August 15, 2013, the Company entered into a Quitclaim Deed (the Deed with Kee Nez Resources, LLC Grantor ),
a Utah limited liability company. Pursuant to the Deed, the Grantor, in consideration of 10 and other valuable consideration,
remise, release, and forever quitclaim unto the Company all of Grantor s right, title, and interest in and to the GSR group
of unpatented lode mining claims situated in Churchill Country, Nevada. As a result, the Company has obtained title to the GSR
claims in August 2013. 

The Company did not incur further expenditures on
the properties during the year ended June 30, 2023 (2022: nil) due to a lack of cash. 

Employees 

We
intend to use the services of subcontractors for manual labor exploration work on our properties. 

Employees
and Employment Agreements 

At present, we have no full-time employees. Our one
officer and director is part-time employees and will devote about 10 of her time or four hours per week to our operation.
Our officer and director does not have an employment agreement with us. We presently do not have pension,
health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans. However, we may adopt plans in the future. There
are presently no personal benefits available to our officer and director. Marilyn Miller, our officer and director,
will handle our administrative duties. Because our officer and director is inexperienced with exploration, she will
hire qualified persons to perform the surveying, exploration, and excavating of the property. As of today, we have engaged private companies
to review and evaluate properties mineral claims located in USA and (Mexico). 

Our
Office 

Our business office is located at #300 
500 North Rainbow Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89107. This is our mailing address as well. Our telephone number is (210) 862-3372.
We use this space on a rent free basis.

ITEM
2. PROPERTIES 

Summary 

The
following is a description of the Company s mineral properties. The Company holds a 100 interest on four contiguous Federal
BLM unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada that were acquired for mineral exploration purposes, primarily in exploration for
precious metals. 

The
Property 

The
four GSR lode mining claims, named GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4, were staked on Federal BLM lands on July 9, 2012 by Kee Nez Resources, LLC,
a Utah limited liability company. The
BLM claim numbers for claims GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 1076314, 1076315, 1076316 and 1076317 respectively. Each of the four claims
are 20.66 acres in size for a total of 82.64 acres. 

The
Company acquired these unpatented claims on August 15, 2013, from Kee Nez Resources, LLC, who quitclaimed the four claims to the
Company. This transfer was filed and recorded with the BLM on August 23, 2013. As a result, Golden Star Resource Corp. holds a
100 interest in the four claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalties. 

A
Maintenance Fee or a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification must be filed annually on or before September 1st in order to keep the
claims valid and is filed in advance for the upcoming assessment year. Since the Company holds less than 10 Federal unpatented
lode mining claims it is entitled to file a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification in lieu of paying the fee of 155 per claim.
Payment of the Maintenance Fee or filing of the Fee Waiver Certification is the responsibility of Golden Star Resource Corp. Notice
of Holding of these claims is also filed annually with Churchill County. 

All
requirements have been met until the next annual due date of September 1, 2024 

There
are no buildings, equipment or other facilities on the claims. Sources of power and water have not been investigated to date. 

The
Company only has mineral rights by virtue of these claims. It does not hold any surface rights. 

Location 

The
GSR 1-4 unpatented lode mining claims are situated in Sections 9 and 16, T14N, R35E, MDM, in Churchill County, Nevada. 

The
property is located 98 air miles southeast of Reno, NV and 48 air miles southeast of Fallon, NV. The property can be accessed
from Fallon by heading east on US Hwy 50 for 46 miles and then heading south on NV 361 for 15 miles. This paved highway cuts across
the southeast corner of the claim group (see Fig 2).

Geology 

The
GSR property lies in the Basin and Range Province near its western margin where it adjoins the northwest-southeast trending Walker
Lane mineral belt. This boundary is about 20 miles west of the GSR property. The Basin and Range Province is a major physiographic
region of the western US, centered on Nevada and western Utah, typified by north-northeast trending mountain ranges separated
by broad flat alluvium filled valleys. Gold and silver mineralization is known to occur in many parts of this Province. 

In
the vicinity of the GSR property there are numerous historical small mine workings in the surrounding mountain ranges, an active
exploration project at Bell Mt. 8 miles to the northwest and several past producing large gold mines, such as Paradise Peak 25
miles to the southeast and Rawhide 25 miles to the west. 

The
near-surface rocks in the area of the GSR property are a series of sub-outcropping Mesozoic Age metasedimentary rocks overlain
by Tertiary Age rhyolitic lavas and volcanoclastics. 

No
exploration has been carried out on the property by GSR and it has not been examined by a GSR contracted professional geologist
or by GSR s officers or directors. 

Due
to current subdued market conditions in the junior natural resource markets the Company has no plans for an exploration program
until it has the ability to raise sufficient funds to engage in an exploration program. Such a program would likely initially
entail prospecting, geological mapping and rock-chip sampling. Quality Assurance and Quality Controls for sampling collection
protocols will be developed with the exploration program as funding allows. There would be no permitting or bonding requirements
for this preliminary phase of exploration. Permits and bonding would be required if and when exploration advanced to a drilling
or trenching phase since those activities cause surface disturbance. 

The
property is currently without any known reserves and any program to be proposed in the future would be exploratory in nature.

3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are not presently a party to any litigation.

4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS 

During
the fourth quarter, there were no matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.

ITEM
5. MARKET FOR COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

Only
a limited market exists for our securities. There is no assurance that our limited market will develop into a regular trading
market, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder in all likelihood will be unable to resell his securities
in our company. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans
unless a regular trading market develops. 

Our
company s securities are traded over-the-counter on the Bulletin Board operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) under the symbol GLNS . Our shares were listed for trading on July 3, 2007.

Dividend
Policy 

We
have not declared any cash dividends. We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings,
if any, in our business operations. 

Section
15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

Our
shares are covered by section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that imposes additional sales practice
requirements on broker/dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally
institutions with assets in excess of 5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding
 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with their spouses). For transactions covered by the Rule, the broker/dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior
to the sale. Consequently, the Rule may affect the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities and also may affect your ability
to sell your shares in the secondary market. 

6 

Section
15(g) also imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell penny securities. These rules require a one
page summary of certain essential items. The items include the risk of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and
secondary marketing; terms important to in understanding of the function of the penny stock market, such as bid 
and offer quotes, a dealers spread and broker/dealer compensation; the broker/dealer compensation,
the broker/dealers duties to its customers, including the disclosures required by any other penny stock disclosure rules; the
customers rights and remedies in causes of fraud in penny stock transactions; and, the NASD s toll free telephone number
and the central number of the North American Administrators Association, for information on the disciplinary history of broker/dealers
and their associated persons. 

Securities
authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans 

We
have no equity compensation plans and accordingly we have no shares authorized for issuance under an equity compensation plan. 

Status
of our public offering 

On
October 25, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared our Form SB-2 Registration Statement effective, file number
333-137922, permitting us to offer up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock at 0.10 per share. There was no underwriter involved
in our public offering. 

On
March 28, 2007, we completed our public offering by raising 107,000. We sold 1,070,000 shares of our common stock at an offering
price of 0.10 per share. 

Use
of Proceeds 

Since the time of raising money by offering shares
of our stock, we have net proceeds of 107,060. We have used proceeds (net of 46,538 accounts payable and accrued liabilities, 284,058
loan payable and 443,485 due to related parties) for the following: 293,408 for professional fees, 49,500 for administration, 98,359
for consulting fees, 13,177 for mineral claim payment, 203,870 for transfer and filing fees, 100,032 for office and sundry, 54,633
for interest expenses, 18,500 for rent, and 54,381 for travel. Our total cash outlays have been offset by a 7,387 foreign exchange
gain. 

ITEM
6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This
section of the quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future
events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate,
intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty
on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject
to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

7 

Plan
of Operation 

We
are a start-up, exploration Stage Corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations. 

There
is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay
our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and do not anticipate generating any revenues until we begin removing and
selling minerals. There is no assurance we will ever achieve these goals. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than the
sale of minerals in order to implement our project and stay in business. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by
others. 

Our
exploration target is to find a mineralized material, specifically, an ore body containing gold. Our success depends upon finding mineralized
material. This includes a determination by our consultant that the property contains reserves. We have not yet selected a consultant.
Mineralized material is a mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriate spaced drilling or underground sampling to support
sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to justify removal. If we don t find mineralized material or if it is not economically
feasible to remove it, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment. 

In
addition, we may not have enough money to complete the acquisition and exploration of a property. If it turns out that we have not raised
enough money to complete our acquisition we will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private placement or
through loans. At the present time, we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance that we would be able
to raise additional money in the future. If we need additional money and cannot raise it, we will have to suspend or cease operations. 

Research
 Development 

As
an exploration stage company in the mining industry we are not involved in any research and development. 

Effects
of Compliance with Environmental Laws 

As
a company in the mining industry we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We strive to comply with all applicable
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are currently taking the steps indicated above. We believe that our operations
are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on environmental matters. These laws and regulations, on federal, state and
local levels, are evolving and frequently modified and we cannot predict accurately the effect, if any, they will have on its business
in the future. In many instances, the regulations have not been finalized, or are frequently being modified. Even where regulations have
been adopted, they are subject to varying and contradicting interpretations and implementation. In some cases, compliance can only be
achieved by capital expenditure and we cannot accurately predict what capital expenditures, if any, may be required. 

8 

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital 

There
is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage corporation
and have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business
is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays
in the acquisition and exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price increases in services. 

To
become profitable and competitive, we need to identify a property and conduct research and explore our property before we start production
of any minerals we may find. If we do find mineralized material, we will need additional funding to move beyond the research and exploration
stage. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing
shareholders. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have completed our public offering as of March 28, 2007 and to date have raised 107,060, we will attempt to raise additional money through
a subsequent private placement, public offering or through loans. 

Currently,
we do not have sufficient funds for our intended business operation. One of our officers and directors, has agreed in financing the related
operating expenditures to maintain the Company. The foregoing agreement is oral; we have nothing in writing. While it was agreed to advance
the funds, the agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law because no consideration was given. At the present time, we have not made
any arrangements to raise additional cash. If we need additional cash and can t raise it, we will either have to suspend operations
until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans. 

Since
inception, we have issued 7,070,000 shares of our common stock and received 107,060. 

In
April 2006, we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to a former officer and director, in consideration of 30 and we issued 3,000,000
shares of common stock to one of our officers and directors in consideration of 30 pursuant to the exemption from registration contained
in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1993. 

We
issued 1,070,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933. This was accounted for as a purchase of shares of common stock. 

As of June 30, 2023, due to related parties balance
of 443,485 (June 30, 2022: 386,449) represents the combination of the following: 

339,985 (June 30, 2022: 282,949) was payable to
a principal shareholder s company, for the operating expenses paid by the related party on behalf of the Company. The loan amount
is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

28,000 (June 30, 2022: 28,000) owed to a director
of the Company, for the amount of office, travel and telephone expenses paid by the related party on behalf of the Company. The amount
is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

75,500 (June 30, 2022: 75,500) owed to a shareholder
of the Company, for the amount of office, travel and telephone expenses paid by the related party on behalf of the Company. The amount
is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Golden Star Resource Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Golden Star Resource Corp. as of June 30, 2023 and the related statements of operations,
changes in stockholders deficit, cash flows, and the related notes (collectively referred to as financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2022 were audited by other auditors. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
in their report dated September 28, 2022. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #1 to
the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #1. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/S/

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2023.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES . 

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being June 30, 2023, we have carried out an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer. Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as at the end of the period covered by
this report. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent
fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls
over financial reporting. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of the controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES - continued 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and includes those policies and procedures which pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this evaluation under the criteria established in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30,
2023. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm with respect to internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission which permit us to provide only our management s report in
this Annual Report. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting identified during the year ended June 30, 2023 which have materially affected, or were reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We have not paid any salaries in 2022 and we do not
anticipate paying any salaries at any time in 2023. We will not begin paying salaries until we have adequate funds to do so. Our directors
do not receive any compensation for serving as members of the board of directors. 

On July 1, 2010, we entered into a consulting agreement
with our director Marilyn Miller for a term of 24 months for a fee of 2,500 per month and was cancelled on the same date. As at June
30, 2023 no consulting was charges by a related party.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION - continued 

There
are no other stock option plans, retirement, pension, or profit sharing plans for the benefit of our officers and directors other
than as described herein. 

To
date, we have not entered into employment contracts with any of our officers and do not intend to enter into any employment contracts
until we have adequate funds to do so. 

Long-Term
Incentive Plan Awards 

We
do not have any long-term incentive plans that provide compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. 

Indemnification 

Under
our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any
proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director
is successful on the merits in a proceeding in which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred,
including attorney s fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably
incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification
is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada. 

Regarding
indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under
Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public
policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

The
following table sets forth, as of the date of this report, the total number of shares owned beneficially by each of our directors,
officers and key employees, individually and as a group, and the present owners of 5 or more of our total outstanding shares.

 The
 persons named above promoters as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Bergstrom and Ms. Miller
 are the only promoters of our company. 

[2]
 
 Ms.
 MacDonald holds title to her common stock in the name of Dimac Capital Corp., a British Columbia corporation which she owns
 and controls. 

Future
Sales by Existing Stockholders 

A
total of 6,000,000 shares of our stock are currently owned by one of our officers and directors, Marilyn Miller, and one individual.
3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Dimac Capital Corp., a corporation owned and controlled by Kathrine MacDonald,
our former officer and director, in April 2006. Another 3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Marilyn Miller, one of
our officers and directors. The 6,000,000 shares are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations
of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions
and restrictions on the manner of sale, commencing one year after their acquisition. Rule 144 provides that a person may not sell
more than 1 of the total outstanding shares in any three month period and the sales must be sold either in a brokers transaction
or in a transaction directly with a market maker. 

15 

Ms.
MacDonald and Ms. Miller will likely sell a portion of their stock, if the market price goes above 0.10. If they sell their stock
into the market, the sales may cause the market price of the stock to drop. In general, sales of shares held by officers or large
shareholders, after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Because
our officers, directors and a principle shareholder control us, regardless of the number of shares sold, your ability to change
the course of our operations is eliminated. As such, there is no value attributable to the right to vote. This could result in
a reduction in value to the shares you own because of the ineffective voting power. 

No
common stock is subject to outstanding options, warrants or securities convertible into common stock. 

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

In
April 2006, 3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Dimac Capital Corp., a corporation owned and controlled by Kathrine
MacDonald, our former officer and director. Additionally, 3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Marilyn Miller, one
of our officers and directors. These transactions were accounted for as acquisitions of shares of common stock for consideration
of 30.

Bergstrom and Ms. Miller are our only promoters. They have not received or will they receive anything of value from us, directly
or indirectly, in their capacities as promoters.
