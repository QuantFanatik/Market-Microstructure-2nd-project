CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements
of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not
limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management
for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions
of performance; and statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Such forward-looking statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. 

In some cases, you can identify
forward looking statements by terms such as may, intend, might, will, should, 
 could, would, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, 
 predict, potential, or the negative of these terms. These terms and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report are based upon management s current expectations and belief,
which management believes are reasonable. However, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any
factor or combination of factors, or factors we are aware of, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements represent
our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events. 

Our business operations are
primarily based in China, and the VIE and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with being based
in China. On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China CAC ), and 12 other relevant PRC government authorities
published the amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on February 15, 2022. The final Cybersecurity Review Measures
provide that a network platform operator that possesses personal information of more than one million users and seeks a
listing in a foreign country must apply for a cybersecurity review. Further, the relevant PRC governmental authorities may initiate a
cybersecurity review against any company if they determine certain network products, services, or data processing activities of such company
affect or may affect national security. As of the latest practicable date, our Company, the VIE and its subsidiaries have not been involved
in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any PRC regulatory authority, nor has any of them received any inquiry, notice
or sanction. We do not believe that we are subject to: (a) the cybersecurity review with the CAC, as we do not possess a large amount
of personal information in our business operations, and our business does not involve the collection of data that affects or may affect
national security, implicates cybersecurity, or involves any type of restricted industry; or (b) merger control review by China s
anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the fact that we do not engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements
or regulatory actions. On February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC ), issued the Trial Administrative
Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, which became effective on March 31,
2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly,
should fulfill the filing procedure and report relevant information to the CSRC. We are required by the Trial Measures to submit a filing
to the CSRC and complete the filing procedures of any overseas public offering, but there is no certainty that we will be able to complete
such filings in a timely manner. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such filing requirements under the Trial Measures
may result in forced corrections, warnings and fines against us and could materially hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer
our securities. It remains highly uncertain the impact of such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation,
our ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. As a result of the legal and operational risks
associated with us being based in and having the majority of our operations in China, such risks could result in a material change in
our operations and/or the value of our securities and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Please see Risks
Associated With Doing Business in China and the associated risk factor on page 44. 

ii 

Since 2021, the Chinese government
has strengthened its anti-monopoly supervision, mainly in three aspects: (1) establishing the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau; (2) revising
and promulgating anti-monopoly laws and regulations, including: the Anti-Monopoly Law (draft Amendment published on October 23, 2021 for
public opinions), the anti-monopoly guidelines for various industries, and the detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Fair Competition
Review System; and (3) expanding the anti-monopoly law enforcement targeting Internet companies and large enterprises. As of the date
of this report, the Chinese government s recent statements and regulatory actions related to anti-monopoly concerns have not impacted
our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange because neither the Company nor
its PRC operating entities engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions. Please see Risks
Associated With Doing Business in China and the associated risk factor on page 44. 

As a holding company with
no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our operating entities established in the
People s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily our variable interest entity and its subsidiaries, collectively, the VIE. Due
to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in certain internet-related businesses we may explore and operate in the future, we do
not have any equity ownership of the VIE, but instead we control and receive the economic benefits of the VIE s business operations
through certain contractual arrangements. We believe such VIE contractual arrangements have not been tested in a court of law in the PRC.
Our shares of common stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market are shares of our Nevada holding company that maintains service agreements
with the associated operating companies. As an investor of our common stock, you may never directly hold equity interests in the Chinese
operating companies. There is a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to affect operations of any company with any level
of operations in PRC, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange,
conduct its business or accept foreign investment. Substantial uncertainties and restrictions with respect to the political and economic
policies of the PRC government and PRC laws and regulations could have a significant impact upon the business that we may be able to conduct
in the PRC and accordingly on the results of our operations and financial condition. If the Chinese regulatory authorities disallow our
structure or any or all of the foregoing were to occur, it could, in turn, result in a material change in the Company s operations
and/or the value of its common stock and/or significantly limit or completely hinder its ability to offer or continue to offer securities
to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

On May 20, 2020, the U.S.
Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act HFCAA requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned
or controlled by a foreign government if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB is unable to audit
specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection. If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company s
auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited to trade on a national exchange. On December 18, 2020,
the HFCAA was signed into law. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act HFCAA ), which became law in December 2020 and prohibits foreign companies from listing their securities on U.S. exchanges
if the company has been unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for three consecutive years. In addition, on June 22, 2021,
the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the AHFCAA ), and on December 29, 2022,
a legislation entitled Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed
into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to the AHFCAA and amended the HFCAA by requiring
the SEC to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections
for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. Our auditor, an independent
registered public accounting firm that issued the audit report with this annual report, as an auditor of companies
that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to
which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered
in New York and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the future, if there
is any regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations located in China
or Hong Kong to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection which could result in
limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets and trading of our securities, including trading on the national exchange
and trading on over-the-counter markets. Please see Risks Associated With Doing Business in China and the
associated risk factor on page 44 for more information. 

iii 

Our contractual agreements
with the VIE have not been tested in court in China and this structure involves unique risks to investors. For example, the PRC government
could disallow the VIE arrangements, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and structure and significant change
in the value of our securities. Such could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. See Risk
Factors Risks Relating to our Corporate Structure and the associated risk factor on page 42 for more information. 

Below is our organizational chart
as of September 20, 2023. 

iv 

You should be aware that our
actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors (some of which
may be beyond our control), including: 

uncertainties relating to our ability to establish and operate our
business in China; uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and the fact that rules and regulations in China can change quickly
with little advance notice, along with the risk that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, or
may exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could result in a material change
in our operations, financial performance and/or the value of our common stock or impair our ability to raise money. 

We depend upon the VIE Agreements in conducting our business in the PRC, which may not be as effective as a direct ownership structure. 

We may not be able to consolidate the financial results of some of
our affiliated companies through the VIE Agreements or such consolidation could materially adversely affect our operating results and
financial condition. 

our ability to operate our company as a U.S. publicly-reporting and listed enterprise; 

uncertainties relating to general economic
and business conditions in China and worldwide; 

industry trends and changes in demand for our products and services; 

uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers; 

announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; 

unanticipated delays in the development, commercialization or market acceptance of our products and services; 

changes in Chinese government regulations; 

availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment suppliers; and 

political stability and economic growth in China.

PART I 

Item 1. Description of Business 

Overview

Patent Acquisition and Technology Protection : Datasea prioritizes the acquisition of U.S. patents to protect its innovations and intellectual
property. Rapidly securing U.S. patents for its technologies is essential to maintain its competitive advantage and defend against potential
infringement. This proactive approach in patent acquisition will ensure that Datasea s intellectual property remains protected in
the U.S. market and provide opportunities for licensing and monetization. These strategies will further strengthen Datasea s position
in the global market, consolidate its innovation capacity and protect its intellectual property assets. 

Mergers
and Acquisitions (M A) and Joint Ventures : Datasea can expand its products and services portfolio by engaging in mergers and acquisitions
or forming joint ventures to meet the growing market demands. Identifying companies that are related to or complementary to the Company s
existing domains of expertise can help Datasea rapidly expand its business and market scale. For example, through M A and collaborations,
Datasea can further strengthen its foundation, market depth, and brand localization in the intelligent acoustics industry in the U.S.
market. 

Contracts
and Collaborations : Datasea can actively seek long-term contracts and collaborations with domestic and international customers, partners,
and major corporate clients. These collaborations can encompass product sales, technical cooperation, and joint research and development,
helping to stabilize revenue and expand market share. 

Compensation and Incentives :
In recognition of the contributions made to the Company s growth by its directors, executives, employees, consultants, and other
external partners, the Company has established a multi-layered compensation and incentive system. This includes incentives such as stock
awards for a publicly traded company and equity holdings in core business subsidiaries. To date, the Company has consistently issued relevant
stocks to directors, executives, employees, and external consultants as part of its stock incentive program. Looking ahead, the Company
plans to extend stock incentive initiatives to even more individuals who contribute significantly to the Company, further encouraging
and ensuring active contributions from talents within the organization. 

Sustainable
Growth : The Company can adopt a sustainable approach to ensure long-term success. This involves focusing on Environmental, Social,
and Governance (ESG) issues, ensuring that the Company s operations align with global best practices, and providing sustainable
solutions to meet demands of customers. 

Market
diversification : In the domestic market, Datasea can continue to provide intelligent acoustics and 5G messaging products to various
end users, such as corporate customers and household users, to ensure market diversification. In the international market, Datasea intends
to target U.S. households and large corporate customers including hospitals, hotels, and schools with leading and high-quality ultrasonic
air sterilization, bathroom and cloakroom sterilization and odor removal products, helping to diversify risks and provide broader growth
opportunities. 

Regulatory
Compliance : When expanding into international markets, the Company needs to closely adhere to regulations and laws in various countries
and regions. Ensuring compliance is crucial for our long-term success. 

In
summary, Datasea can pursue its business strategy through international business expansion, technological innovation, contracts and collaborations,
and a sustainable growth approach. This will help ensure that the Company gains a competitive advantage in global markets and creates
sustainable value for its shareholders.

to which the Shuhai Beijing stockholders have granted Tianjin Information or its designee(s) the irrevocable right and option to acquire
all or a portion of Shuhai Beijing Stockholders equity interests in Shuhai Beijing for an option price of RMB0.001 for each capital
contribution of RMB1.00. Pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement, Tianjin Information and the Shuhai Beijing Stockholders have agreed

There are a number of uncertainties
regarding the status of the rights of Datasea, our Nevada holding company, with respect to its contractual arrangements with the VIE,
its founders and owners, including whether the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual agreements due to
uncertainties under Chinese law and jurisdictional limits. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in any internet-related
businesses we may explore and operate, we do not have any equity ownership of the VIE, but instead we receive the economic benefits of
the VIE s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital
Markets are shares of our Nevada holding company that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese
regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities
could decline or become worthless. 

We believe that our corporate
structure and contractual arrangements comply with the current applicable PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that each of the contracts
among our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, our consolidated VIE and its shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with
its terms. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and
regulations. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain
whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would
provide. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities
have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. 

Having our operations conducted
by the subsidiaries and through contractual arrangements with a variable interest entity (VIE) based in China involves unique risks to
investors. The VIE structure is used to allow foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or restricts direct
foreign investment in the operating entities, and Datasea s shareholders may never directly hold equity interests in our Chinese
operating entities. The VIE contractual agreement has not been tested in court. We may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant
resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. 

All of these contractual arrangements
are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would
be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. In addition, contractual
arrangements entered into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Such
scrutiny may lead to additional tax liability and fines, which would hinder our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. If the PRC
government deems that the VIE Agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries
or other laws or regulations of the PRC, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we
could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations, which may therefore materially reduce
the value of our ordinary shares. In the event that in the future a company we hold as a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE under
applicable accounting rules, or we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary, we would not be able to consolidate line by line that
entity s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes. For a detailed discussion of risks facing
the Company as a result of this VIE structure, please see Risks Relating to our Corporate Structure from page 42 to page
45 in the Annual Report.

cash transfers and Dividend
Distribution 

Shuhai Beijing receives substantially
all of its revenue in RMB. Under Shuhai Beijing s current corporate structure, to fund any cash and financing requirements Shuhai
Beijing may have, Datasea may rely on dividend payments from its subsidiaries. The WFOE may receive payments from Shuhai Beijing, and
then can remit payments to Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited in accordance with its registration with the Chinese authority under
the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Relevant Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic
Residents to Engage in Financing and in Return Investment via Overseas Special Purpose Companies and pursuant to the VIE Agreements.
Then Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited may make distribution of such payments directly to Datasea as dividends thereto. Cash dividends,
if any, on our shares of common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. 

Under the existing PRC foreign
exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions,
can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE by
complying with certain procedural requirements. Pursuant to the SAFE Circular 37, Shuhai Beijing is allowed to pay dividends in foreign
currencies to WFOE without prior approval from the SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the
PRC shall comply with certain procedures under the PRC foreign exchange regulations applicable to PRC residents only. Approval from or
registration with appropriate PRC government authorities is, however, required where RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and
remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may
also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for Shuhai Beijing s accounts with little advance notice. 

Datasea is a Nevada company
conducting substantially all of its operations in China through its PRC subsidiaries, the VIE and its subsidiaries established in China.
Datasea may make loans to the PRC subsidiaries and VIE entities subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of
amount, or may make additional capital contributions to subsidiaries and VIE entities in China. 

Any loans to the subsidiaries
or VIE entities in China are subject to foreign investment and are under PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For
example, loans by us to the wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries or VIE entities in China to finance their activities must be registered
with the local counterpart of SAFE. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity
and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)
directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations;
(ii) directly or indirectly use for investment in securities or investments other than banks principal-secured products unless
otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly
permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except
for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other
things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments
in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and does not violate with the negative list on
foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry this
out in practice. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by
offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the
necessary government approvals on a timely basis. 

Current PRC regulations permit
WFOE to pay dividends to Shuhai Information Skill (HK) Limited only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with
Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, in accordance with Article 166 of the PRC Company Law, each of the subsidiaries
in China is required to set aside at least 10 of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve
reaches 50 of its registered capital. Each such entity in China may further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits as the discretionary
common reserve, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of such entities board of directors. Although

Intelligent Acoustics

Industry overview 

Acoustics is an application-oriented
subject that continually meets various societal needs and application demands, and exhibits significant development potential. For instance,
the integration of acoustics with electronics and communication technology has satisfied people s demands for communicating and enjoying
audiovisual content in various occasions, resulting in massive industries such as electroacoustics, telephony, and television. The blend
of acoustics and architectural art fulfills the human need for appreciating high-quality music, theater, movies, and other audiovisual
programs. Acoustics combined with fields like oceanography addresses challenges related to long-distance underwater detection and communication,
providing efficient and indispensable means for human to explore and utilize the oceans. The synergy of acoustics with medicine has given
rise to instruments like ultrasound and HIFU, offering new and effective tools for disease diagnosis and treatment and undergoing rapid
development. Furthermore, the convergence of acoustics with linguistics, information technology, and related fields has driven the development
of speech recognition and synthesis technologies, subsequently linking with cognitive science, making it as one of the fundamental and
crucial directions in the future of artificial intelligence. This is why the field of acoustics remains vibrant and dynamic. 

Specifically, according to
the frequency of sound waves, they are divided into sound waves, ultrasound waves, and infrasound waves. The function of sound waves is
to transmit vibration energy and information. A sound wave is a wave that travels through a medium in the form of vibration. The vibrating
object causes the air layer particles around it to compress and expand alternately. This change is from near to far, so that the vibration
of the excited object spreads at a certain speed. The transmission of this vibration energy is the nature of the propagation of sound
waves. 

Industry Application
and Market Scale 

There continues to be significant
demand and diverse opportunities for the integration of acoustics with fields such as life and health, natural resources, and agriculture.
For example, ultrasound technology has promising application prospects in various sectors, including healthcare, industrial, environmental
protection, beauty, and agriculture. Additionally, Schumann resonance has shown effectiveness in sleep health and directional audio plays
a crucial role in specific content delivery and personal privacy protection, among other applications. Among these, ultrasound technology,
particularly in the areas of air purification, beauty, and agricultural pest control, holds immense market potential. 

Ultrasound, or ultrasonics,
is the science and technology of sound at frequencies beyond what we can hear. It has a wide range of applications, from medical and health,
industrials/inspections, and agriculture. As per The Business Research Company s Ultrasonic Technology Global Market Report 2023,
the global ultrasound technology market size will grow from 1.8 billion in 2022 to 2.1billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 13 . The ultrasound technology market size is then expected to grow to 3.3 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 12 . 

12 

Directional sound is sound technology that is
aimed in a particular directional field, rather than spreading naturally according to traditional sound engineering principles. Directional
sound can be useful in many different kinds of applications, from home entertainment and consumer products to the evolution of sonic weaponry.
According to the Report Prime Market Research, the global directional sound technology market size will grow from 406 million in 2022
to 431 million in 2023. The directional sound technology market size is then expected to grow to 652 billion in 2030 at a CAGR of 6.1 . 

Schumann resonance, or the earth s heartbeat ,
triggers an Alpha state in human brain which helps people relax, heal faster, and perform better in the daily life. It s the measurement
of 7.83 Hz or the electromagnetic frequency of the earth. One of the biggest applications of Schumann resonance is to treat insomnia,
which is to help people improve their sleep quality. 

Infrasound is a wave phenomenon of the same physical
nature as sound but with frequencies below the range of human hearing, specifically below a frequency of 20 Hz. Infrasound is also a powerful
weapon in medical and health, such as cancer therapy. 

The management believes that
acoustics has substantial room for development in the aforementioned domains. 

Technological
advancement 

The Company has non-visual
intelligent algorithms and techniques, as well as intelligent acoustics such as applied technology of ultrasound, directional sound, and
5G messaging related applications applicable to various industries in China. Leveraging artificial intelligence technology, the Company
has effectively developed a range of products, represented by ultrasound disinfection and sterilization. Besides, the Company has innovated
in areas such as Schumann resonance, directional sound and other aspects, and mastered core technologies and their practical applications
in various scenarios. 

The
Company effectively uses the characteristics of ultrasound, such as mechanical effect, thermal effect, cavitation effect and other physical
characteristics as well as the combination of chemical effects, to make coronavirus and microorganisms vibrate with very large vibration
amplitude, producing strains that could break certain parts of the virus and do damage to the outer shell and to the RNA inside. Eventually,
the high-speed movement of the proton of ultrasound can destroy the formation of microorganisms and can kill bacteria and virus effectively.
Leading labs such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology have proven this ultrasonic disinfection technology to have 99.83 efficacy in nine
seconds against Covid-19 and 99.99 efficacy against Staphylococcus Albus and E-col. 

Datasea
intends to harness its expertise in directional sound technology as a fundamental tool. Simultaneously, intelligent digital processing
technology will be integrated, facilitating its amalgamation with other acoustic applications to realize directional service functionalities
across diverse acoustic products. This presents a huge potential for the future. Directional sound employs hyper-directional acoustic
propagation technology and ultrasound as the medium and modulates audio signals onto the ultrasonic signal, enabling originally divergent
sound to propagate unidirectionally like a spotlight, thereby controlling sound within a limited sound field ahead while minimizing attenuation
during long-distance propagation. 

The
Datasea team leverages Magnetic Induction of Brain Rhythm (MIBR) technology based on Schumann resonance characterized by ultra-low frequency
and weak intensity. This technology is specifically designed to selectively enhance and regulate the function of neuronal cells through
the utilization of magnetic induction wave energy (MIBR). By generating a natural frequency magnetic field in resonance with the inherent
frequencies of the human body, it induces brain waves to enter a deep sleep state, thereby extending the duration of deep sleep and enhancing
its quality. This innovative approach is aimed at optimizing sleep patterns and ultimately improving overall sleep quality. 

13 

Our Opportunity 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
people have become increasingly concerned about their health and the quality of the air in their surroundings. This surge in demand for
indoor and in-vehicle air purification, air disinfection, and odor removal has propelled the market into a period of robust growth. Leveraging
its proprietary technology and operational expertise in harnessing various core characteristics of ultrasound, Datasea has benefited from
the rapid development of the indoor environmental purification and air disinfection and sterilization industry worldwide. 

The collaborative technology
of sonic and artificial intelligence is a disruptive applied technology in the skin repair market. Currently, most of the existing ultrasonic
facial beauty devices on the market utilize the strong penetrating power of ultrasound, capable of reaching depths of 4 to 6mm beneath
the skin s surface, to provide therapeutic treatments for facial skin whitening and texture improvement, and they are contact-based. The
company s contactless ultrasonic and AI skin repair technology and products, especially including the artificial intelligence collaboration
of intelligent control arm precision control and AI real-time diagnosis, are disruptive technology applications for the skin repair market.
This sector complements the current medical aesthetic industry, which includes six major segments such as cleansing, moisturizing, whitening,

Currently, there are relatively
few similar technology applications and products related to contactless ultrasonic skin repair technology, directional sound and Schumann
resonance in the domestic market, leaving huge opportunities and gaps to be filled. 

The broad application prospects
of Schumann resonance collaborative technology. The natural
frequency magnetic field of Schumann resonance itself has the effect of relieving anxiety and stress, inducing brain waves to enter a
deep sleep state, effectively improving the quality of deep sleep, and keeping people away from insomnia. The Magnetic Induction of Brain
Rhythm (MIBR) technology, which is mastered by the Company, can create a natural frequency magnetic field similar to Schumann frequency
by selectively optimizing and regulating the function of neuronal cells through magnetic induction wave energy (MIBR). It can alleviate
stress and solve insomnia problems, and the application terminals of its technology are also portable and convenient to use, which has
a great effect on the improvement of sub-health problems in the global population. 

Directional sound is currently
mainly applied in fields such as audio enhancement, sound system enhancement, and security and communication. Due to technical bottlenecks,
adaptability to application scenarios, and cost, there are relatively few similar technological applications and products in the domestic
market, and there are a large number of gaps and entry opportunities in the market. The Company has mastered the principles and characteristics
of directional sound propagation, as well as the development of corresponding scenario applications. As a basic technology tool, directional
sound s innovative collaboration with existing ultrasound and other technology applications and products is expected to fill the
market gap globally. 

Faced with these promising
market opportunities, the Company has proactively established a strategic presence in the field of acoustic intelligence. We have strategically
planned for technological advancements, specialized applications, product development, and customer orientation within this domain. As
a result of this strategic planning, the Company has rapidly launched ultrasonic-based antivirus equipment. This includes our first-generation
surface virus disinfection and sterilization products, as well as our second-generation air antivirus products known as the Hailijia series.

Impact of coronavirus outbreak 

In early December 2022, China
announced a nationwide relaxation of the zero-coronavirus policy, and the recovery of consumption directly drove the Company s 5G
message top-up business to achieve rapid growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak still depends
on future mutations of the virus, including new information about the severity of the global outbreak and the measures taken, or the emergence
of new or more severe strains that are highly uncertain and unpredictable. Therefore, while we do not expect the COVID-19 outbreak to
have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the relevant financial impact cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time. 

Recent Material Developments 

During the reporting period,
the Company has granted 3,459,500 registered shares under S-8 under the 2018 equity incentive plan to its directors, management, founding

Our CORPORATE History and
STRUCTURE 

VIE Agreements 

Datasea relies on contractual
arrangements with the consolidated VIE and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, Chairman of the Board, President, CEO of Datasea and Corporate
Secretary, and Fu Liu, a Director of the Datasea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu), to operate our business. The contractual arrangements
with respect to the VIE are not equivalent to an equity ownership in the business of the VIE. We consolidate the VIE as a primary
beneficiary through the contractual agreements between Tianjin Information, an indirect subsidiary of Datasea and Shuhai Beijing, the
VIE. If the consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our
recourse to the assets held by the consolidated VIE is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources
to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in
light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution
proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in the consolidated VIE, including such equity interest,
may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual
arrangement or ownership by the record holder of the equity interest. 

A condensed consolidating
schedule that breaks down the operations and depicts the financial position, cash flows, and results of operations as of the same dates
and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 in tabular form was contained in pages F-12 to F-16 of the 2021 Annual Report. 

All of these contractual
arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts
would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal
environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S.. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system
could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements,
or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, it would be very
difficult to exert effective control over the consolidated VIE, and our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

channels in the United States, and the establishment of Datasea Acoustics LLC, a Delaware subsidiary in the U.S., confirms the Company s
pace and determination in implementing its global business strategy. 

Strong and diverse management
team : The Company has an experienced and visionary management team that can effectively drive strategic plans and adapt to market
changes. 

Building an international
talent team is essential for the sustainable development of the Company. Firstly, we actively tap into internal potential by sending our
Vice General Manager of the Research and Development Department, Mr. Li Huan, to pursue further education at a university in Austria.
This helps us cultivate talents reserve and acquire new technological knowledge. Secondly, we continuously recruit specialized talents,
both in China and the United States, to enhance the Company s capabilities in management, marketing, sales, capital markets, and
corporate governance, promoting our level of internationalization. 

The Company s management
team is also very diversified. Among the five members of the board of directors, there are three males and two females, a 40 female representation
on the board. Additionally, within the Company s management, there are four Asian and one White executives. Taking into account
the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO), the Company s executive team comprises seven members, including
four males and three females. This reflects the Company s commitment to and demonstration of diversity, equality, and transparency.

Endorsement from the third-party
technical certification : Leading third-party labs such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology have proven this ultrasonic disinfection
technology to have 99.83 efficacy in nine seconds against Covid-19 and 99.99 efficacy against Staphylococcus Albus and E-col. Meanwhile,
this strategic shift and process support the Company to provide a safer and healthier lifestyle for users worldwide in the post-pandemic
era with a greater focus on protection and quality of life. 

ESG (Environmental, Social,
and Governance) Initiatives : Commitment to ESG principles can attract socially responsible investors and enhance the Company s
reputation. 

Research and Development 

Datasea s board of directors
and management attach great importance to the building of a technological product innovation and research and development system. 

Primarily, the Company s core research and development efforts
are directed towards the advancement and innovation of various technologies encompassing acoustic applications and artificial intelligence.
The overarching objective of innovative research rooted in acoustics is to provide technical support for the development of acoustic applications
across various industries. In the realm of acoustic intelligence, which includes ultrasound, infrasound, directional sound, and Schumann
resonance, the Company has carried out in-depth collaborations with esteemed research institutions such as the Institute of Acoustics
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, the China Institute of Information and Communication Technology,
the China Institute of Standards, and the China Artificial Intelligence Industry Alliance in technological innovation, expert resources,
and the industry standards development. 

As
of now, the Company s acoustic research and development has formed a core application matrix of acoustic technology with ultrasound as
the core and Schumann resonance and directional sound as the assistance. 

In
terms of ultrasound, the Company innovatively uses the longitudinal wave collaborative field of air ultrasound, and the skin-promoting
effect of standing surface wave accelerates the skin repair cycle. Moreover, the high-frequency vibration characteristics of ultrasound
are fully reflected in the micro-particle atomization method, and the atomization spray using special consumables can fully penetrate
into the dermis of the skin, which can double skin repair effect. 

In
terms of directional sound, the Company has achieved a breakthrough in the transmission of sound waves within an extremely narrow angle
(25 degrees) and also achieved signal recovery at the lowest audible frequency in the world (20Hz). 

In
addition, the Company s R D team has developed a general pretrained transformer based on AI and a pretrained Large Language
Model (LLM) with deep scene fusion. The intelligent service module based on the large language model has been widely used in the Company s
5G messaging business and digital city services, which can effectively improve user efficiency.

Production
mode 

In the Chinese market, on the basis of a comprehensive understanding
of the industry and the market, the Company has adopted the model of manufacturing outsourcing in the production of intelligent acoustic
hardware products and an independent or joint design model in product appearance, and established the control process of prototype
selection - prototype determination - content determination - replication efficiency and replication effect on the basis of product
line standardization. At the same time, the Company has established the R D management process from approval-node monitoring-assessment ,
and optimized the standard manufacturing process and construction management process to guide factory production, supply chain procurement
and project site construction. During the reporting period, the Company has added a professional antivirus and odor removal equipment
manufacturer to customize and produce bathroom and cloakroom odor products and equipment using Datasea s intelligent acoustics technology.
Meanwhile, Schumann sleep aid product has been finalized and developed with partner manufacturers. 

In
the U.S. market, with the establishment of Datasea Acoustics LLC, a subsidiary in the United States, the establishment of assembly lines
and production lines has been initiated. At the same time, cooperation with various local manufacturing enterprises will also be
a rapid way to realize international production of products. 

Control
over manufacturing process and quality 

1. The
 Company has the following requirements on outsourcing partners: independent production facilities,
 advanced manufacturing equipment, smart production lines, abundant outsourcing cooperation
 cases and a good reputation in the industry. 

2. Outsourcing
 partners shall pass through ISO9001:2008, ISO14001:2004, OHSAS18001:2007 and CCC certification,
 and meet our production and manufacturing standards. 

3. Outsourcing
 partners should have a separate quality management department to take charge of the overall
 quality management system including establishment, maintenance and continuous improvement. 

4. Outsourcing
 partners should have built up a relatively complete quality management system; 

SQA:
control over supplier quality system, quality standard formulation, quality assurance capability improvement and guidance, material quality
confirmation; 

IPQC:
responsible for quality control of the manufacturing process, to make sure that the manufacturing process meets relevant technical and
quality requirements, and problems are timely identified, back-fed and addressed; 

QC:
responsible for overall inspection and delivery inspection of finished products. 

5. 
 The
 Company checks whether the manufacturing quality of outsourcing partners meets the Company s requirements by assigning resident
 personnel to do sample test of manufactured goods and collecting feedback from the customer experience. 

32 

Outsourcing partners and outsourced products 

As of June 30, 2023, we have established partnerships with approximately
60 outsourcing partners. We are currently seeking other outsourcing partners and looking for new opportunities to retain and optimize
our outsourcing and supply chain resources. 

Government
Regulation and Licenses 

Our
operations are subject to and affected by PRC laws and regulations. The primary governmental regulation regulating the Internet security
equipment industry in the PRC is the Cybersecurity Law, effective June 1, 2017, which governs entities providing critical information
infrastructure. This statute provides basic protections for Internet users, such as not selling individual s data to other
companies without the user s permission and not knowingly distributing malware. China s new Data Security Law took effect
in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification
and hierarchical protection system for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored
in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. 

On
December 28, 2021, thirteen governmental departments of the PRC, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (the CAC ),
issued the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective on February 15, 2022. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provide that
an online platform operator, which possesses personal information of at least one million users, must apply for a cybersecurity review
by the CAC if it intends to be listed in foreign countries. Because the VIE s current operations do not possess personal information
from more than one million users at this moment, the Company does not believe that the Company is subject to the cybersecurity review
by the CAC. In addition, as of the date of this report, the Company has not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review
initiated by any PRC regulatory authority, nor has the Company received any inquiry, notice, or sanction related to cybersecurity review
under the Cybersecurity Review Measures. 

The
wholly owned subsidiaries and the VIE and its subsidiaries are required to have, and each has, a business license issued by the PRC State
Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterparts. In addition, major PRC regulations applicable to our products and services
and the Internet security industry include Internet Security Protection Technology Measures Provision (Ministry of Public Security Order
No. 82) Order 82 ). Order 82 specifies certain security measures Internet service providers shall take to ensure Internet
security. Providers of ISP connecting service and Internet-based data processing service are within the scope of Order 82. It does not
call for any license or permission to any entities. 

The
Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory
agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of
PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
or CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle s securities on an overseas stock exchange. Substantial
uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Although we believe
that CSRC s approval is not required for the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that relevant
PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.

1A. Risk Factors 

An
investment in our common stock is very speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk
factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any shares of our common stock. No purchase of our common stock should be made by
any person who is not in a position to lose the entire amount of his or her investment. The order of the following risk factors is presented
arbitrarily. You should not conclude the significance of a risk factor because of the order of presentation. Our business and operations
could be seriously harmed as a result of any of these risks. 

Risks
Relating to Our Business and Industry 

We have a limited operating history as
a developer of intelligent acoustics, 5G messaging and other products and services. Our limited operating history may not provide an
adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations. 

We have a limited operating history. The operating entity, Shuhai Beijing,
was formed in February 2015 and may not generate material revenue or any profit in the foreseeable future. We are still in the process
of developing, marketing and expansion of our business. We expect that our intelligent acoustics (including ultrasound, infrasound, directional
sound, and Schumann resonance), 5G messaging and other products and services will be our core business in the future. We have limited
experience and operating history in developing and marketing our products and services. In addition, the market for our products and services
is highly competitive. If we fail to successfully develop and offer our products and services in an increasingly competitive market, we
may not be able to capture the potential growth opportunities associated with our products and services or recover our development and
marketing costs, and our future results of operations and growth strategies could be adversely affected. Our limited history may not provide
a meaningful basis for investors to evaluate our business, financial performance and prospects. 

35 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm s auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We
are an early and development stage company and have limited financial resources. We had cash balances of 164,217 and 19,728 as of June
30, 2022 and June 30, 2023, respectively. We generated revenues of 7,045,311 during the year ended June 30, 2023. We had a net cash
outflow of 144,489 during fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We had a deficit of approximately 28,067,500 at June 30, 2023. 

Our resources and source of
funds have primarily consisted of loans and capital contributions from shareholders and funds raised from equity financing. We believe
these are sufficient to keep our business operations functioning for the next twelve months. We have generated revenue of 7,045,311 from
our business during the year ended June 30, 2023, and our expenses will be accrued until sufficient financing is obtained or our shareholders
loan us the necessary funds to pay for these expenses. 

On August 1, 2023, the Company
entered into two separate subscription agreements with a certain non-U.S. investor Investor A ), pursuant to which the Company
agreed to sell and Investor A agreed to purchase an aggregate of 4,760,000 shares of common stock price at a 1.2 per share purchase price.
Such shares must be held for a period of 365 days. In accordance with such two agreements and a subsequent supplementary agreement, Investor
A shall pay a total purchase price of 5,712,000 in RMB, at an amount of RMB 40,000,000, no later than September 30, 2023. On September
21, the Company has received all of the payment of RMB 40,000,000. 

On August 15, 2023,
Datasea Inc. (the Company entered into a subscription agreement with a non-U.S. investor (the Investor B ),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and Investor B agreed to purchase an aggregate of 2,962,963 shares of common stock at a 1.35
per share purchase price, with a total subscription price of 4,000,000. Such shares must be held for a period of 180 days. On August
16, 2023, the investor made the initial investment payment of RMB 5,000,000 to the Company, equal to 714,286. 

On September 13, 2023,
the Company closed its underwritten public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 0.40 per share,
for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1,635,000, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. In addition,
the Company has granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of common stock at the public offering
price per share. 

Although such liquidity
concern may be mitigated by the Company s sale of shares, no assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain funds from our
shareholders or others to continue our operations in the future. We may need to seek additional financing. The financing sought may be
in the form of equity or debt financing or a combination of both from various sources as yet unidentified. No assurance can be given that
we will generate sufficient revenue or obtain the necessary financing to continue as a going concern and the failure to do so could cause
us to cease our operations. 

Supply
chain issues that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business
and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which
could adversely affect our gross margins. 

Currently,
we do not own or operate our manufacturing facilities, but rely on third-party contractors to manufacture our products, and expect that
we will continue to rely on existing and new contractual manufacturers for the foreseeable future. The following reliance issues could
have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results: 

Any financial problems
 of our contract manufacturers or component suppliers could limit supply or increase costs; 

Reservation of manufacturing
 capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could limit supply or increase costs;
 and 

Industry consolidation
 occurring within one or more component supplier markets could limit supply or increase costs. 

In
addition, the following supply chain-related issues could adversely affect our customer relationships, operating results and financial
condition: 

a reduction or interruption
 in supply of one or more components; 

a significant increase
 in the price of one or more components 

a failure to adequately
 authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; and 

a failure to appropriately
 cancel, reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs. 

36 

Over
the long term, we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed,
or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results. 

While we intend to focus on
managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering,
sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources to key growth areas, such as intelligent acoustics, 5G messaging
and other products and services. We are likely to recognize the costs and expenses associated with these investments earlier than some
of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not
achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may
be adversely affected. 

Our business substantially depends upon
the continued growth of intelligent acoustics, 5G messaging and other products and services, the decrease of which could have a negative
impact on our business. 

A substantial portion of our
business and revenue depends on the growth of intelligent acoustics, 5G communication in the PRC and globally, including the continued
development and expansion of the Internet. To the extent that an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty and any related reductions
in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, we could experience material harm to our business, operating
results and financial condition. 

Because
of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related, we believe that we could receive a high degree
of publicity and visibility. Because smart security systems are our major products and resources, our business, operating results and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our
own products or services. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent
of direct effects on our business. 

Product
quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income. 

The sonic air sterilization
products we provide is highly complex as the products incorporate both hardware and software technologies. There can be no assurance that
the pre-shipment testing programs we develop in the future will be adequate to detect all defects, including defects in individual products
or defects affecting numerous shipments. Such potential defects might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities
or affect gross margins. As an example, software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. From
time to time, we will have to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in our
products. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material adverse impact
on our business. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal
from a product or market, damage to our reputation, additional inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could
have a material adverse impact on our revenue, margins and net income. 

We
will likely have to incur indebtedness or issue new equity securities to fund future growth. If we are not able to obtain additional
capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Our
business requires significant levels of capital to finance the research and development of new products and service platforms that meet
the constantly evolving industry standards and consumer demands. As such, we expect that we will need additional capital to fund our
future growth. For the time being, we are primarily depending on contribution from shareholders, equity financing and cash income. If
cash from such sources is insufficient or unavailable, or if cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital
sooner than anticipated. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties,
including: 

investors perceptions
 of, and demand for, companies operating in China; 

conditions of the U.S.
 and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds; 

37 

our future results of operations,
 financial condition and cash flows 

governmental regulation
 of foreign investment in China; 

economic, political and
 other conditions in the United States, China and other countries; and 

governmental policies relating
 to foreign currency borrowings. 

The
sale of additional equity securities would result in dilution of our existing shareholders. In addition, the incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations.
It is highly uncertain whether financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are not able to
obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely
affected. 

Our
success is dependent on retaining key personnel who would be difficult to replace. 

Our
success depends largely on the continued services of our key management and technical staff. In particular, our success depends on the
continued efforts of Ms. Zhixin Liu, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, President and Corporate Secretary,
and Mr. Fu Liu, one of our directors and Ms. Liu s father. Ms. Liu and Mr. Liu have been instrumental in developing our business
model and are crucial to our business development. There can be no assurance that they will continue in their present capacities for
any particular period of time. The loss of the services of Ms. Liu and/or Mr. Liu could materially and adversely affect our business
development. 

The
various industries we are in are characterized by constant and rapid technological change and evolving standards. If we fail to anticipate
and adapt to these changes and evolutions, our sales, gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected. 

Technologies change rapidly
in the intelligent acoustics, 5G messaging industries with frequent new products and service developments and evolving industry standards.
Companies operating within these industries are continuously developing new products and services with heightened performance and functionality,
putting pricing pressure on existing products. Accordingly, we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue
to anticipate technological changes and to offer additional product and service opportunities that meet evolving standards on a timely
and cost-effective basis. Our failure to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies or adapt to fluctuations in the industry
could lead to our having significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices and profit margins
than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to develop planned new technologies, we may be unable to compete effectively due to our
failure to offer products or services most demanded by the marketplace. Products and services that our competitors develop or introduce
may also render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete. If any of these failures occur, our business and results of operations
would be adversely affected. 

We
depend on contract manufacturers, and our production and products could be harmed if they are unable to meet our volume and quality requirements
and alternative sources are not available. 

We
rely on third party contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. If these services become unavailable,
we would be required to identify and enter into new agreements with other contract manufacturer or take the manufacturing in-house. The
loss of our contract manufacturers could significantly disrupt production as well as increase the cost of production. These changes could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

38 

We
have seen a substantial improvement and progress in our internal control over financial reporting. If no improvement measures are taken,
or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls
in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely
affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 

Our management has assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting with an assessment report as of June 30, 2023, and plans to shorten
the cycle and increase the frequency concerning the testing cycle for the effectiveness of internal control measures. The annual risk
control assessment reporting system will be improved to a quarterly risk control assessment system. 

Our efforts in the building
of our internal control system are not limited to the formulation and implementation of financial management and control measures, but
focuses on the combination of comprehensive and targeted control to build up an internal control system that best fits us. According to
the management system imperfections concerning job responsibilities and departmental processes that are identified through self-examination,
the Company, by highlighting six elements of internal environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and internal supervision and seven control measures of separate control of incompatible functions, authorization and approval control,
accounting system control, property protection control, budget control, operation analysis control and performance appraisal control ,
is gradually establishing and improving an internal control system featuring organizational structure, development strategy, human resources,
social responsibility, corporate culture, financial activities, procurement business sales business, research and development, financial
reports, comprehensive budget, contract management, internal information transfer and information system and other contents, and it is
formulating the internal control system applicable to the whole company and organizing related implementation in accordance with relevant
laws and regulations and supporting measures.. 

By the end of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2023, we have established a Risk Control Department led by the internal control director and external legal counsels to
ensure the Company s compliance with relevant regulations and risk management requirements. We also formulated new policies or integrated
a series of internal control policies, including but not limited to the process from procurement to payment, the process from payment
to the sales, cash management, cost management, budget process, accounts receivable policy, policy to prevent and detect fraud, assets
and inventory management, internal audit policy and cost accounting. We further set up bookkeeping under U.S. GAAP and we provided training
for our employees, such as the Finance Department, Marketing Department, and senior executives. We also set up the International Affair
Department to strengthen our compliance and financing management in the international capital market. 

39 

Our
compliance with complicated U.S. regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses.
Moreover, our ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations is uncertain given our management s relative inexperience
with operating U.S. public companies. 

As
a public company, we are facing with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and
standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases
due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated
by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards
of a U.S. public company are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management
time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. 

Moreover,
our executive officers have little experience in operating a U.S. public company, which makes our ability to comply with applicable laws,
rules and regulations uncertain. Our failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could
subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. 

Failure
to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely affect our business. 

We
are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (or FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in
bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including
some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent
practices occur from time-to-time in mainland China. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment
from personnel of other companies or government agencies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government
officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. 

We
have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China. Companies with operations in China have been accused and found
guilty of sales practices that involve unlawful activity, including violations of the FCPA. We believe to date we have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of the FCPA. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less
than effective, and the employees, consultants and/or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.
Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively
affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor
liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. 

40 

We
may be subject to liability if private information that we receive is not secure or if we violate privacy laws and regulations. 

Because
we store, process and use data, some of which contain personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state and
foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to
constant evolvement and change and uncertain interpretation. Any violation of these laws could result in investigations, claims, changes
to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in user growth, retention or engagement, any of which could materially
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In
November 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress passed China s first cybersecurity law, or CSL, which
took effect in June 2017. The CSL systematically lays out cybersecurity and data protection regulatory requirements and subjects many
previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace and data management to government scrutiny. Compliance costs and other
burdens related to CSL as well as China s regulatory measures on the collection, storage, use and provision of network data may
affect users use and acceptance of our products and services, and may have a significant adverse impact on our business, directly
affecting our market development channels and financial revenue capacity. 

The
European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 GDPR ), which came into effect on May 25, 2018, includes operational
requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Economic Area. The GDPR establishes new
requirements applicable to the processing of personal data i.e. , data which identifies an individual or from which an individual
is identifiable), affords new data protection rights to individuals e.g. , the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes
penalties for serious data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under the GDPR for financial or non-financial losses.
Although we do not conduct any business in the European Economic Area, in the event that residents of the European Economic Area access
our website and input protected information, we may become subject to provisions of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will impose additional
responsibilities and liabilities in relation to our processing of personal data. The GDPR may require us to change our policies and procedures
and, if we are not compliant, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We
are also subject to laws restricting disclosure of information relating to our employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws,
policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy, data security, cybersecurity and data protection. However,
given that the scope, interpretation, and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be conflicting, it is
possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and
may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service-providers to comply
with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized
release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation,
or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 

41 

Risks
Relating to Our Corporate Structure 

Our corporate structure,
in particular, the Variable Interest Entity (or VIE), and their agreements (or VIE Agreements), are subject to significant risks, as
set forth in the following risk factors. 

If
the PRC government deems that the VIE Agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant
industries or other laws or regulations of the PRC, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the
future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations, which may therefore materially
reduce the value of our ordinary shares. 

We are a holding company
incorporated in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations
through the operating entities established in the People s Republic of China, or the PRC, primarily our variable interest entity
(the VIE and its subsidiaries. Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership in any internet-related businesses we
may explore and operate, we do not have any equity ownership of the VIE, instead we control and receive the economic benefits of the
VIE s business operations through certain contractual arrangements. Our common stock currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Markets
are shares of Datasea, our Nevada holding company, that maintains service agreements with the associated operating companies. The Chinese
regulatory authorities could disallow our structure, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities
could decline or become worthless. For a description of our corporate structure and contractual arrangements, see Our Organizational
Structure on page 22 and VIE Agreements on page 4. 

We believe that our corporate
structure and contractual arrangements comply with the current applicable PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that each of the
contracts among our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, the consolidated VIE and its shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with its terms. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws
and regulations. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain
whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would
provide. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government
authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. 

If
these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the future and our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are deemed
by the relevant regulators that have competent authority, to be illegal, either in whole or in part, we may lose control of the consolidated
VIE, which conducts our manufacturing operations, holds significant assets and accounts for significant revenue, and have to modify such
structure to comply with regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption
to our business. Further, if our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are found to be in violation of any existing or future
PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including: 

revoking our business and
 operating licenses; 

levying fines on us; 

confiscating any of our
 income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations; 

shutting down our services; 

discontinuing or restricting
 our operations in China; 

imposing conditions or
 requirements with which we may not be able to comply; 

requiring us to change
 our corporate structure and contractual arrangements; 

restricting or prohibiting
 our use of the proceeds from overseas offering to finance the consolidated VIE s business and operations; and 

taking other regulatory
 or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. 

Furthermore, new PRC laws,
rules and regulations may be introduced to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our corporate structure and contractual
arrangements. The occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations and the market price of our common stock. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties or requirement to restructure
our corporate structure causes us to lose the rights to direct the activities of the consolidated VIE or our right to receive their economic
benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of such VIE in our consolidated financial statements, which
may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or even become worthless. 

42 

We
depend upon the VIE Agreements in conducting our business in the PRC, which may not be as effective as equity ownership. 

We rely on contractual arrangements
with the consolidated VIE and its shareholders, Zhixin Liu, Chairman of the Board, CEO and President of Datasea, and Fu Liu, a Director
of Datasea (Fu Liu is the father of Zhixin Liu), to operate our business. The affiliation with Shuhai Beijing is managed through the VIE
Agreements, which agreements may not be as effective in providing us with control over Shuhai Beijing as equity ownership. These contractual
arrangements may not be as effective as equity ownership in providing us with control over the consolidated VIE. If the consolidated VIE
or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held
by the consolidated VIE is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements
in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the
PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets
under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in the consolidated VIE, including such equity interest, may be put under court
custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or ownership
by the record holder of the equity interest. 

All
of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC.
Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC
legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. As a result, uncertainties
in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce
these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual
arrangements, it would be very difficult to exert effective control over the consolidated VIE, and our ability to conduct our business
and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

We
may not be able to consolidate the financial results of some of the affiliated companies or such consolidation could materially adversely
affect our operating results and financial condition. 

All of our business is conducted
through Shuhai Beijing, which is considered a VIE for accounting purposes, and we are considered the primary beneficiary, thus enabling
us to consolidate its financial results in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the future a company we hold as
a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE under applicable accounting rules, or we are deemed not to be the primary beneficiary,
we would not be able to consolidate line by line that entity s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for reporting
purposes. Also, if in the future an affiliate company becomes a VIE and we become the primary beneficiary, we would be required to consolidate
that entity s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes. If such entity s financial
results were negative, this would have a corresponding negative impact on our operating results for reporting purposes. 

Because
we rely on the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement with Shuhai Beijing for our revenue, the termination of this agreement
Or be forcibly discharged would severely and detrimentally affect our continuing business viability under our current corporate structure. 

We
are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through the VIE Agreements. As a result, our revenues mainly rely
on dividend payments from Tianjin Information after it receives payments from Shuhai Beijing pursuant to the Operation and Intellectual
Property Service Agreement. Shuhai Beijing may terminate the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement for any or no reason
by Chinese government at all. Because neither we, nor the subsidiaries, own equity interests of Shuhai Beijing, the termination of the
Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement would sever our ability to continue receiving payments from Shuhai Beijing under
our current holding company structure. While we are currently not aware of any event or reason that may cause the Operation and Intellectual
Property Service Agreement to terminate, we cannot assure you that such an event or reason will not occur in the future. In the event
that the Operation and Intellectual Property Service Agreement is terminated, this would have a severe and detrimental effect on our
continuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which, in turn, may affect the value of your investment. 

Contractual
arrangements entered into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Such
scrutiny may lead to additional tax liability and fines, which would hinder our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. 

Under PRC law, arrangements
and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. If any of the transactions entered
into by the subsidiary and the PRC operating affiliate are found not to have been conducted on an arm s length basis or to result
in an unreasonable reduction in tax under PRC law, the PRC tax authorities have the authority to disallow tax savings, adjust the profits
and losses of the respective PRC entities and assess late payment interest and penalties. 

43 

The shareholders of the VIE may have potential conflicts of
interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Ms.
Zhixin Liu and Mr. Fu Liu are majority shareholders of Datasea and the shareholders of the VIE, Shuhai Beijing. Ms. Liu is our Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary, while Mr. Liu is one of our directors. They may have potential conflicts of interest
with us. These shareholders may breach, or cause the VIE to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have
with them and the VIE, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to effectively control the VIE and receive substantially
all the economic benefits from it. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements with Shuhai Beijing to be performed
in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis.
We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company
or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor. 

Currently,
we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these shareholders and our company. We rely on Ms.
Liu and Mr. Liu to abide by the laws of the State of Nevada and China, which provide that directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company
that requires them to act in good faith and in what they believe to be the best interests of the Company and not to use their position
for personal gains. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the shareholders of Shuhai Beijing, we would
have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the
outcome of any such legal proceedings. 

If any of the affiliated entities becomes
the subject of a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, we may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by such entity, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We currently conduct our operations
in China through contractual arrangements with the affiliated entities. As part of these arrangements, substantially all of our assets
that are important to the operation of our business are held by the affiliated entities. If any of these entities goes bankrupt and all
or part of their assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business
activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the affiliated
entities undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its equity owner or unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights
relating to some or all of these assets, which would hinder our ability to operate our business and could materially and adversely affect
our business, our ability to generate revenue and the market price of our common stock. 

We are a controlled company 
within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and, as a result, may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements
that provide protection to shareholders of other companies. 

We are a controlled
company as defined under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules because Mr. Liu and Ms. Liu hold more than 50 of our voting power. For
so long as we remain a controlled company under that definition, we are permitted to elect to rely, and will rely, on certain exemptions
from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including: 

the requirement that our director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors; and 

the requirement that we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities. 

As a result, you will not
have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the
NASDAQ Stock Market. 

Risks Associated With Doing Business in China 

Changes in the policies of the PRC government
could have a significant impact upon the business we may be able to conduct in the PRC and the profitability of our business. 

The PRC s economy is
in a transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy subject to five-year and annual plans adopted by the government that
set national economic development goals. Policies of the PRC government can have significant effects on the economic conditions within
the PRC. The PRC government has confirmed that economic development will follow the model of a market economy. Under this direction, we
believe that the PRC will continue to strengthen its economic and trading relationships with foreign countries and business development
in the PRC will follow market forces. While we believe that this trend will continue, there can be no assurance that this will be the
case. A change in policies by the PRC government could adversely affect our interests by, among other factors: changes in laws, regulations
or the interpretation thereof, confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports or sources of supplies, or the expropriation
or nationalization of private enterprises. Implementation of the negative list system. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic
reform policies for more than two decades, there is no assurance that the government will continue to pursue such policies or that such
policies may not be significantly altered, especially in the event of a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or other
circumstances affecting the PRC s political, economic and social environment. 

44 

The approval and/or other requirements of
the CSRC or other mainland China governmental authorities may be required in connection with our issuance of securities overseas under
mainland China rules, regulations or policies, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such
approval or complete such other requirements. 

The Regulations on Mergers
and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, purport to require offshore special purpose vehicles
that are controlled by mainland China companies or individuals and that have been formed for the purpose of seeking a public listing on
an overseas stock exchange through acquisitions of mainland China domestic companies or assets to obtain CSRC approval prior to publicly
listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. The interpretation and application of the regulations remain unclear. If CSRC
approval is required, it is uncertain how long it will take for us to obtain such approval, and, even if we obtain such CSRC approval,
the approval could be rescinded. Any failure to obtain or a delay in obtaining CSRC approval for our future issuance of securities overseas
may subject us to sanctions imposed by the CSRC and other mainland China regulatory agencies, which could include fines and penalties
on our operations in mainland China, restrictions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends outside of mainland China, and other
forms of sanctions that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Furthermore, on July 6, 2021,
the PRC government promulgated the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, or the July 6 Opinions, which,
among other things, called for enhanced administration and supervision of overseas-listed mainland China-based companies, proposed to
strengthen the supervision of the overseas issuance and listing of shares by mainland China-based companies and clarified the responsibilities
of competent domestic industry regulators and government authorities. On December 28, 2021, the CAC, together with other relevant administrative
departments, jointly released the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity
Review Measures, network platform operators with personal information of over one million users shall apply with the Cybersecurity Review
Office for a cybersecurity review before going to list abroad. 

The new rules for the filing-based
administration of overseas securities offerings and listings by Chinese domestic companies released on February 17, 2023, or New Filing
Rules, establish a new filing-based regime to regulate overseas offerings and listings by domestic companies. According to the New Filing
Rules, (i) an overseas offering and listing by a domestic company, whether directly or indirectly, shall be filed with the CSRC; and (ii)
the issuer or its affiliated domestic company, as the case may be, shall file with the CSRC for its initial public offering, follow-on
offering, issuance of convertible bonds, offshore relisting after go-private transactions and other equivalent offing activities. In addition,
after a domestic company has offered and listed securities in an overseas markets, it is required to file a report to the CSRC after the
occurrence and public disclosure of certain material corporate events, including but not limited to, change of control and voluntary or
mandatory delisting. From March 31, 2023, enterprises that have been listed overseas shall constitute existing enterprises and are not
required to conduct the overseas listing filing procedure immediately, but shall carry out filing procedures as required if they conduct
future offshore offerings or capital raising activities or are involved in other circumstances that require filing with the CSRC. 

On February 24, 2023, the CSRC, together with other relevant government
authorities, issued the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing
by Domestic Companies, or the Archives Rules, which became effective on March 31, 2023. According to the Archives Rules, domestic mainland
China companies, whether offering and listing securities overseas directly or indirectly, must strictly abide the applicable laws and
regulations when providing or publicly disclosing, either directly or through their overseas listed entities, documents and materials
to securities companies, securities services providers such as accounting firms, or overseas regulators in the process of their overseas
offering and listing. If such documents or materials contain any state secrets or government authorities work secrets, domestic companies
must obtain the approval from competent governmental authorities according to the applicable laws, and file with the secrecy administrative
department at the same level with the approving governmental authority. Furthermore, the Archives Rules also provides that securities
companies and securities service providers shall also fulfill the applicable legal procedures when providing overseas regulatory institutions
and other relevant institutions and individuals with documents or materials containing any state secrets or government authorities work
secrets or other documents or materials that, if divulged, will jeopardize national security or public interest.

A slowdown or other adverse developments
in the PRC economy may harm our customers and the demand for our services and our products. 

All of our operations are
conducted in the PRC. Although the PRC economy has grown significantly in recent years, there is no assurance that this growth will continue.
A slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic developments in the PRC could significantly
reduce the demand for our products and services. 

If relations between the United States and
China worsen, investors may be unwilling to hold or buy our stock and our stock price may decrease . 

At various times during recent
years, the United States and China have had significant disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the
future between these two countries that may affect our economic outlook both in the United States and in China. Any political or trade
controversies between the United States and China, whether or not directly related to our business, could reduce the price of our common
stock. 

Future inflation in China may inhibit the
profitability of our business in China. 

In recent years, the Chinese
economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money
supply and rising inflation. If prices for our services and products rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in
the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by Chinese government, from
time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation.
High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which
could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our services and products. 

The fluctuation of the Renminbi may have
a material adverse effect on your investment. 

The change in value of the
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, various factors, such as changes in China s political and
economic conditions and China s foreign exchange controls. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of
pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under such policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed
band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Later on, the People s Bank of China has decided to further implement the reform
of the RMB exchange regime and to enhance the flexibility of RMB exchange rates. Such changes in policy have resulted in a significant
appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar since 2005. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government
to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant adjustment of the Renminbi against the
U.S. dollar. Any significant appreciation or revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on the value of, and any dividends
payable on, shares of our common stock in foreign currency terms. More specifically, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars,
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. To the extent
that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our 2018 offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi
against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. In addition, appreciation
or depreciation in the exchange rate of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar could materially and adversely affect the price of shares of our
common stock in U.S. dollars without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. 

46 

Restrictions on currency exchange may limit
our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively. 

Substantially all of our revenue
is denominated in Renminbi. As a result, restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi
to fund any business activities we may have outside China in the future or to make dividend payments to our shareholders in U.S. dollars.
Under current PRC laws and regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for current account items, such as trade and service-related foreign
exchange transactions and dividend distributions. However, Renminbi is not freely convertible for direct investment or loans or investments
in securities outside China, unless such use is approved by SAFE. For example, foreign exchange transactions under the subsidiary s
capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, remain subject to significant foreign
exchange controls and the approval requirement of SAFE. These limitations could affect our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency
for capital expenditures. And the Chinese government is further strengthening the control of foreign exchange, we will not be able to
change the Chinese government s decision in our own power. 

The subsidiaries and affiliated entities
in China are subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us. 

Datasea is a holding company
and relies principally on dividends paid by its subsidiaries in China for our cash needs, including paying dividends and other cash distributions
to our shareholders to the extent we choose to do so, servicing any debt we may incur and paying our operating expenses. Tianjin Information s
income in turn depends on the service fees paid by its affiliated entities, including the VIE, in China. Current PRC regulations permit
the subsidiary in China to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting
standards and regulations. Under the applicable requirements of PRC law, Tianjin Information may only distribute dividends after it has
made allowances to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, if the subsidiaries
or affiliated entities in China incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability
to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any such restrictions may materially affect such entities ability to make dividends
or make payments, in service fees or otherwise, to us, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. 

47 

Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal
system could have a material adverse effect on us. 

The PRC legal system is a
civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law system may be cited as
reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, newly introduced PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections
of interest relating to foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system
continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of such laws and regulations may not always be consistent, and enforcement of these laws.
In different administrative areas and regulations involves significant uncertainties, any of which could limit the available legal protections.
In addition, the PRC administrative and judicial authorities have significant discretion in interpreting, implementing or enforcing statutory
rules and contractual terms, and it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative and judicial proceedings and the level
of legal protection we may enjoy in the PRC than under some more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may affect our decisions
on the policies and actions to be taken to comply with PRC laws and regulations, and may affect our ability to enforce our contractual
or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited legal actions or threats in an attempt to
extract payments or benefits from us. Such uncertainties may therefore increase our operating expenses and costs, and materially and adversely
affect our business and results of operations. 

The PRC s legal and judicial system
under special circumstances may not adequately protect our business and operations and the rights of foreign investors. 

The legal and judicial systems
in the PRC are still rudimentary, and enforcement of existing laws is uncertain. As a result, it may be impossible to obtain swift and
equitable enforcement of laws that do exist, Different administrative regions have different legal and judicial interpretations or to
obtain enforcement of the judgment of one court by a court of another jurisdiction. The PRC s legal system is based on the civil
law regime, that is, it is based on written statutes. A decision by one judge does not set a legal precedent that is required to be followed
by judges in other cases. In addition, the interpretation of Chinese laws may be varied to reflect domestic political changes. 

The promulgation of new laws,
changes to existing laws and the pre-emption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. There can be
no assurance that a change in leadership, social or political disruption, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the PRC s political,
economic or social life, will not affect the PRC government s ability to continue to support and pursue these reforms. Such a shift
could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 

48 

Certain PRC regulations, including the M A
Rules and national security regulations, may require a complicated review and approval process which could make it more difficult for
us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

The M A Rules established
additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time-consuming
and complex. For example, the MOFCOM must be notified in the event a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. In addition,
certain acquisitions of domestic companies by offshore companies that are related to or affiliated with the same entities or individuals
of the domestic companies, are subject to approval by the MOFCOM. In addition, the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers
and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises, issued by the MOFCOM in August 2011, require that mergers and acquisitions
by foreign investors in any industry with national security concerns be subject to national security review by the MOFCOM.
In addition, any activities attempting to circumvent such review process, including structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual
control arrangement, are strictly prohibited. There is significant uncertainty regarding the interpretation and implementation of these
regulations relating to merger and acquisition activities in China. In addition, complying with these requirements could be time-consuming,
and the required notification, review or approval process may materially delay or affect our ability to complete merger and acquisition
transactions in China. As a result, our ability to seek growth through acquisitions may be materially and adversely affected. In addition,
if the MOFCOM determines that we should have obtained its approval for our entry into contractual arrangements with the affiliated entities,
we may be required to file for remedial approvals. There is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such approval from the MOFCOM.
We may also be subject to administrative fines or penalties by the MOFCOM that may require us to limit our business operations in the
PRC, delay or restrict the conversion and remittance of our funds in foreign currencies into the PRC or take other actions that could
have material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

PRC regulation of loans and direct investment
by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to the PRC
subsidiary and affiliated entities, which could harm our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. 

Datasea is a Delaware company
conducting substantially all of its operations in China through its PRC subsidiaries, the VIE and its subsidiaries established in China.
Datasea may make loans to the PRC subsidiaries and VIE entities subject to the approval from governmental authorities and limitation of
amount, or may make additional capital contributions to subsidiaries and VIE entities in China. 

Any loans to the subsidiaries
or VIE entities in China are subject to foreign investment and are under PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For
example, loans by us to the wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries or VIE entities in China to finance their activities must be registered
with the local counterpart of SAFE. In addition, a foreign invested enterprise shall use its capital pursuant to the principle of authenticity
and self-use within its business scope. The capital of a foreign invested enterprise shall not be used for the following purposes: (i)
directly or indirectly used for payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations;
(ii) directly or indirectly use for investment in securities or investments other than banks principal-secured products unless
otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; (iii) the granting of loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except where it is expressly
permitted in the business license; and (iv) paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except
for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises). On October 23, 2019, the SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Convenience of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or the SAFE Circular 28, which, among other
things, allows all foreign-invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments
in China, as long as the equity investment is genuine, does not violate applicable laws, and does not violate with the negative list on
foreign investment. However, since the SAFE Circular 28 is newly promulgated, it is unclear how SAFE and competent banks will carry this
out in practice. In light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by
offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the
necessary government approvals on a timely basis. 

49 

We must remit offering proceeds to China
in a future securities issuance before they may be used to benefit our business in China, the process of which may be time-consuming,
and we cannot assure that we can complete all necessary governmental registration processes in a timely manner. 

The proceeds of a future offering
may be remitted back to the PRC, and the process for wiring such proceeds back to the PRC may be time-consuming after the closing of a
future offering. We may be unable to use these proceeds to grow our business until the PRC subsidiaries receive such proceeds in the PRC.
Any transfer of funds by us to the PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject
to approval by or registration or filing with relevant governmental authorities in China. Any foreign loans procured by the PRC subsidiaries
is required to be registered with China s State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE or its local branches or
satisfy relevant requirements, and the PRC subsidiaries may not procure loans which exceed the difference between their respective total
project investment amount and registered capital or 2 times (which may be varied year by year due to the change of PRC s national
macro-control policy) of the net worth of the PRC subsidiary. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises
in China, capital contributions to the PRC subsidiaries are subject to the approval of or filing with State Administration for Market
Regulation in its local branches, the Ministry of Commerce in its local branches and registration with a local bank authorized by SAFE. 

In light of the various requirements
imposed by PRC regulations on loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if
at all, with respect to future loans by us to the PRC subsidiary or with respect to future capital contributions by us to the PRC subsidiary.
If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to capitalize or otherwise fund the PRC operations may
be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to fund and expand our business and our
securities. 

A failure by the beneficial owners of our
shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our ability to distribute profits,
restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC law. 

SAFE has promulgated regulations,
including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through
Special Purpose Vehicles (or SAFE Circular No. 37), effective on July 4, 2014, and its appendices, that require PRC residents, including
PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control
of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents legally owned assets or equity
interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular No. 37 as a special purpose vehicle. 
SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special
purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division
or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required
SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore
parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in
its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements
described above could result in liability under PRC law for foreign exchange evasion. 

These regulations apply to
our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers that we make
in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views
and procedures on the application and implementation of SAFE regulations, and since SAFE Circular No. 37 was relatively new, there remains
uncertainty with respect to its implementation. As of the date of this report, all PRC residents known to us that currently hold direct
or indirect interests in our company have completed the necessary registrations with SAFE as required by SAFE Circular 37. However, we
may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can
we compel our beneficial owners to comply with the requirements of SAFE Circular 37. However, we cannot assure you that these individuals
or any other direct or indirect shareholders or beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents will be able to successfully complete
the registration or update the registration of their direct and indirect equity interest as required in the future. If they fail to make
or update the registration, our shareholders could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and SAFE could restrict our cross-border investment
activities and our foreign exchange activities, including restricting the PRC subsidiary s ability to distribute dividends to, or
obtain loans denominated in foreign currencies from, our company, or prevent us from paying dividends. As a result, our business operations
and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.

We may be subject to fine due to our insufficient
payment of the social insurance and housing fund of the employees. 

Pursuant to the Social Insurance
Law of the PRC, as amended on December 29, 2018,and the Regulation on the Administration of Housing Accumulation Funds, as amended on
March 24, 2019, employers in China shall register with relevant social insurance agency and relevant housing provident fund management
center and open special housing provident fund accounts for each of their employees, and pay contributions to the social insurance plan
and the housing provident fund for their employees, such contribution amount payable shall be calculated based on the employee s
actual salary in accordance with the relevant regulations. In case the employer failed to make sufficient payment of the social insurance,
it may be subject to fine up to 3 times of the insufficient amount and pay late fees. If the employer failed to register with relevant
housing provident fund management center or failed to open special housing provident fund accounts for the employees within the ordered
time limit, a fine of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000 may be imposed. In addition, if the employer fails to pay sufficient
contributions to housing provident fund as required, the housing provident fund management center shall order it to make the payment and
deposit within a prescribed time limit; where the payment has not been made after the expiration of the time limit, the housing provident
fund management center may request the people s court for compulsory enforcement. On July 20, 2018, the General Office of the Communist
Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Reform Plan on Tax Collection and Administration Systems
for Local Offices of the State Administration of Taxation and Local Taxation Bureaus, according to which the collection and administration
of social insurance will be transferred from the social insurance departments to competent tax authorities, and the supervision over the
payment of social insurance will be significantly strengthened in the way that an enterprise must pay social insurance for its employees
based on their overall salary at certain legally required rates. If we are fined due to insufficient payment of the social insurance and
housing fund of the employees, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

You may face difficulties in protecting
your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder of ours since we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and all
of our officers and directors reside in China. 

We conduct substantially all
of our operations in China through Shuhai Beijing, our consolidated VIE in China. All of our current officers and directors reside outside
the United States and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. Because of this, it may
be difficult for you to conduct due diligence on our company, our executive officers or directors and attend stockholder meetings if the
meetings are held in China. As a result, our public stockholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions
against our management, directors or major stockholders than would stockholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly
within the United States. 

You may experience difficulties in protecting
your rights through the United States courts. 

Currently, substantially all
of our operations are conducted in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of our officers are nationals or
residents of the PRC and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult
for a stockholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or to enforce judgments against us which are
obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States or any state in the United States. 

In addition, it may be difficult
or impossible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon us our directors and officers in the event that you believe
that your rights have been violated under United States securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in effecting service
of process and bringing an action of this kind, the laws of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the
assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the PRC of judgments obtained in the United States. 

51 

Increases in labor costs in the PRC may
adversely affect our business and our profitability. 

The economy of China has been
experiencing significant growth, leading to inflation and increased labor costs. China s overall economy and the average wage in
the PRC are expected to continue to grow. Future increases in China s inflation and material increases in the cost of labor may
materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. 

Our auditor is headquartered in the United
States and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. To the extent that our independent registered public accounting firm s
audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company become located in China, the PCAOB may not be able inspect such audit
documentation and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our common stock could be delisted from the stock
exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 

Our independent registered
public accounting firm issued an audit opinion on the financial statements included in this report filed with the SEC and will issue audit
reports related to our company in the future. As auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered
with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the
extent that our auditor s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because
the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms
that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control
procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. On December 2, 2021, the Securities
and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA. We
are required by the HFCAA to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a
Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely certain named registered
public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our independent registered public accounting firm is headquartered
in the United States and has been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis and as such, it is not affected by or subject to the PCAOB s
Determination Report. To the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor s audit documentation related to their audit
reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB, our common stock could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant
to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 

Our securities may be prohibited
from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the
PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for two consecutive years. As a result, an exchange may determine
to delist our securities. 

In light of recent events indicating greater
oversight by the CAC over data security, we may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cybersecurity and
data protection, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business and
our securities. 

Since 2021, the Chinese government
has strengthened its anti-monopoly supervision, mainly in three aspects: (1) establishing the National Anti-Monopoly Bureau; (2) revising
and promulgating anti-monopoly laws and regulations, including: the Anti-Monopoly Law (draft Amendment published on October 23, 2021 for
public opinions), the anti-monopoly guidelines for various industries, and the detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Fair Competition
Review System; and (3) expanding the anti-monopoly law enforcement targeting Internet companies and large enterprises. As of the date
of this report, the Chinese government s recent statements and regulatory actions related to anti-monopoly concerns have not impacted
our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange because neither the Company nor
its PRC operating entities engage in monopolistic behaviors that are subject to these statements or regulatory actions. 

On November 14, 2021, the
Cyberspace Administration of China CAC released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comments),
or the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has not been promulgated
as of the date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding more than one million
users/users individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data processing activities refers
to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. According
to the latest amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022,
an online platform operator holding more than one million users/users individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity
review before listing abroad. 

52 

As of the date of this report,
Datasea, its subsidiaries, the VIE and VIE s subsidiaries have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries
to go through cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that Datasea, its subsidiaries, the VIE and VIE s
subsidiaries do not possess personal data of at least one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect
national security in their business operations as of the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one
million users personal information or data that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty,
however, as to how the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether
the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation
related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation
and interpretation come into effect, we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of
such laws on us. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in
the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. 

Compliance with China s new Data Security
Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review (revised draft for public consultation), Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation),
regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant
expenses and could materially affect our business. 

China has implemented or will
implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China s new Data Security Law promulgated
by the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress of China in June 2021, or the Data Security Law, will take effect in
September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on data classification
and hierarchical protection system for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored
in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government. As the Data Security
Law has not yet come into effect, we may need to make adjustments to our data processing practices to comply with this law. 

Additionally, China s
Cyber Security Law, requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures
to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt
a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure
that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or
tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their
information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity s information and network systems belong-from the lowest
Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to the Measures for the Graded Protection and the Guidelines for Grading of Classified Protection
of Cyber Security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities
classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval. 

Recently, the Cyberspace Administration
of China has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities
exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According
to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on
Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at preventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding
public interests. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity
Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users
if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country. 

It is unclear at the present
time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on the life
sciences sector generally and the Company in particular. China s regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from
fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market. 

In addition, our securities
may be prohibited from trading on a national exchange or over-the-counter in the United States under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act, if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditors for two consecutive years. 

Also, on August 20, 2021,
the National People s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law, which will be implemented on November 1, 2021. The
law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands
data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in
China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing
products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also proposes that critical information
infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set
by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass
a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains
proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5 of annual revenues from the prior year. 

53 

Interpretation, application
and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation,
amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law could
significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent
us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite
our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security,
it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security
Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or
any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized
access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing
types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting
with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation,
any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are
not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and
the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging
in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market. 

On November 14, 2021, the
Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on the Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comments), or the Data
Security Management Regulations Draft, to solicit public opinion and comments till December 13, 2021, which has not been promulgated as
of the date of this report. Pursuant to the Data Security Management Regulations Draft, data processors holding more than one million
users/users individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. Data processing activities refers
to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. According
to the latest amended Cybersecurity Review Measures, which was promulgated on November 16, 2021 and became effective on February 15, 2022,
an online platform operator holding more than one million users/users individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity
review before listing abroad. 

As of the date of this report,
Datasea, its subsidiaries and VIE entities have not received any notice from any authorities requiring the PRC subsidiaries to go through
cybersecurity review or network data security review by the CAC. Given that the PRC subsidiaries do not possess personal data of at least
one million individual clients and do not collect data that affects or may affect national security in their business operations as of
the date of this report and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users personal information or data
that affects or may affect national security in the near future. There remains uncertainty, however, as to how the Cybersecurity Review
Measures and the Security Administration Draft will be interpreted or implemented and whether the PRC regulatory agencies, including the
CAC, may adopt new laws, regulations, rules, or detailed implementation and interpretation related to the Cybersecurity Review Measures
and the Security Administration Draft. If any such new laws, regulations, rules, or implementation and interpretation come into effect,
we will take all reasonable measures and actions to comply and to minimize the adverse effect of such laws on us. We cannot guarantee,
however, that we will not be subject to cybersecurity review and network data security review in the future, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. 

We may be subject to intellectual property
infringement claims, which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely to us, materially disrupt our
business. 

Internet and technology companies
are frequently involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights, unfair competition, invasion
of privacy, defamation and other violations of third-party rights. The validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual
property in Internet-related industries, particularly in China, are uncertain and still evolving. In addition, many parties are actively
developing and seeking protection for Internet-related technologies, including seeking patent protection. There may be patents issued
or pending that are held by others that cover significant aspects of our technologies, products, business methods or services. As we face
increasing competition and as litigation becomes more common in China in resolving commercial disputes, we face a higher risk of being
the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. 

In particular, if we are found
to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, may be ordered
to pay damages or fines, and may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives. We may incur substantial expense in defending
against third party infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial
monetary liability or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business by restricting or prohibiting our use of the intellectual property
in question. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations .

Risks
Relating to An Investment in Our Common Stock 

If
we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited
public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us. 

On December
9, 2022 , Datasea received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department
(the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq notifying Datasea that,
for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, Datasea s Market Value of Listed
Securities MVLS was below the 35 million minimum requirement for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the MVLS Requirement ). Therefore, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C)
(the Rule ), Datasea was provided 180 calendar days, or until June
7, 2023, to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. Subsequently, o n June 8, 2023, Datasea received a letter from Nasdaq
indicating that Datasea had not regained compliance with the Rule (the Delisting Notice ), and that accordingly, its securities
will be delisted from Nasdaq. Thus, unless Datasea requests an appeal of that determination pursuant to procedures set forth in the Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5800 Series, trading of Datasea s common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on June 20, 2023, and
a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove Datasea s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. 

On
June 14, 2023, Datasea requested an appeal of Nasdaq s determination and a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ).
As stated in the Delisting Notice, a hearing request will stay the suspension of Datasea s securities and the filing of the Form
25-NSE pending the Panel s decision. 

On
August 3, 2023, Datasea appeared before a Nasdaq hearing panel and requested for additional time to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement.
On August 11, 2023, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company, granting an extension to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement by October
2, 2023, or otherwise Datasea s common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. The Company intends to monitor the market value of the
Company s listed securities and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the MVLS Requirement. 

On
August 7, 2023, Datasea received a deficiency letter (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq
Stock Market notifying the Company, that based upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the last 30 consecutive
business days, the Company is not currently in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for
continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). 

The
Notice has no immediate effect on the continued listing status of the Company s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and,
therefore, the Company s listing remains fully effective. 

However,
the Company is provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until February 5, 2024, to regain compliance
with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). If at any time before February 5, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock
closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, subject to Nasdaq s discretion to extend this
period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G), Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance
with the Minimum Bid Requirement, and the matter would be resolved. 

If
the Company does not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement during the initial 180 calendar day period, the Company may be
eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing
requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the
exception of the Minimum Bid Requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the
second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 

The
Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and will evaluate available options to regain compliance
with the Minimum Bid Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement
during the 180-day compliance period, secure a second period of 180 days to regain compliance or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq
listing requirements. 

55 

If
Datasea fails to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules, it could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If
Datasea s securities lose their status on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Datasea s securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter
market. If Datasea s securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling Datasea s securities could be more
difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts 
coverage of Datasea may be reduced. In addition, in the event Datasea s securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory
burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in Datasea s securities, further limiting
the liquidity of such securities. A determination that our common stock is a penny stock will require brokers trading in
our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading
market for our common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for Datasea s
securities. Such delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and continued or further declines in Datasea s share price could also
greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the
ownership dilution to stockholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. 

Our
majority stockholders will control our Company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval. 

Our
 officers and directors collectively hold approximately 50.4 beneficial ownership of our
 Company. Two directors are members of the same family. As a result, such individuals will
 have the ability, acting together, to control the election of our directors and the outcome
 of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our
 Company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our
 articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could
 have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise
 be beneficial to our other shareholders and be disadvantageous to our shareholders with interests
 different from those individuals. These individuals also have significant control over our
 business, policies and affairs as officers and directors of our Company. Therefore, you should
 not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our Company. 

An
active and visible trading market for our common stock may not develop. 

We
cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will develop in the future. In the absence of an active trading market: 

Investors may have difficulty buying and
 selling or obtaining market quotations; 

Market visibility for our common stock may
 be limited; and 

A lack of visibility for our common stock
 may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. 

The
trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, changes
in analysts earnings estimates, announcements of innovations by us or our competitors, general conditions in the industry in which
we operate and other factors. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect
on the market price of our common stock. 

The
market price for our common stock may be volatile. 

The
market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as: 

the perception of U.S. investors and regulators
 of U.S. listed Chinese companies; 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; 

changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; 

56 

negative publicity, studies or reports; 

conditions in Chinese and global cybersecurity
 product markets; 

our capability to match and compete with
 technology innovations in the industry; 

changes in the economic performance or market
 valuations of other companies in the same industry; 

announcements by us or our competitors of
 acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 

addition or departure of key personnel; 

fluctuations of exchange rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and 

general
economic or political conditions in or impacting China. 

In
addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the
operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of
our common stock. 

Our
common stock is thinly traded and you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise
money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares. 

Our
common stock is thinly-traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near
bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including
the fact that we are relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community
that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might
be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became
more seasoned. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent,
as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales
without an adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained. 

Our
common stock may be considered a penny stock, and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may
make it more difficult to sell. 

Our
common stock may be considered to be a penny stock if it does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition
of penny stock under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act, as amended. Our common stock may be a penny stock 
if it meets one or more of the following conditions: (i) the stock trades at a price less than 5.00 per share; (ii) it is NOT traded
on a recognized national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or even if so, has a price less
than 5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than
 5 million. The principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities broker-dealers participating
in sales of our common stock will be subject to the penny stock regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a
document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two
business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers
in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor.
This procedure requires the broker-dealer to: (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment
experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable
for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of
penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made
the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately
reflects the investor s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements
may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise
dispose of them in the market or otherwise. 

57 

FINRA
sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock, which could depress the price of
shares of our common stock. 

FINRA
rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending
that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers
must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s financial status, tax status and investment objectives,
among other things. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend
that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock, have an adverse effect
on the market for shares of our common stock, and thereby depress price of our common stock. 

Potential
future sales under Rule 144 may depress the market price for our common stock. 

In
general, under Rule 144, a person who has satisfied a minimum holding period of between six months to one-year, as well as meeting any
other applicable requirements of Rule 144, may thereafter sell such shares publicly. Therefore, the possible sale of unregistered shares
may, in the future, have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in the over-the-counter market. 

Volatility
in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation. 

The
market for our common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price
may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated
securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in
the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert
management s attention and resources. 

We
are not likely to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We
currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect
to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy as circumstances dictate. Should we determine to pay
dividends in the future, our ability to do so will depend upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from Shuhai Beijing. Shuhai
Beijing may, from time to time, be subject to restrictions on its ability to make distributions to us, including restrictions on the
conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions.

1C. Cybersecurity. 

Our cybersecurity measure
is primarily focused on ensuring the security and protection of computer systems and networks. All pertinent domestic operating entities
of the Company shall adhere to a standardized Company Confidentiality System, which shall be centrally overseen and enforced by Shuhai

for information pertaining to network security, data security, and information that, if disclosed, could have detrimental effects on the
public interest and the Company. We plan to establish an appropriate confidentiality framework and adhere to relevant document management
regulations. The Company and its employees are also required to sign confidentiality agreements for purposes including ensuring cybersecurity.
As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any material risks from cybersecurity threats, that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Market
Information 

Our common stock started trading
on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol DTSS in 2018. Based on the records of our transfer agent, we had 32,784,133
shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of September 20, 2023. We have not made any repurchases of the equity securities of Datasea
for the period covered by this report. 

Holder 

We had 102 holders of record of our common stock as of September 20,
2023. 

Dividends 

We
do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. We currently plan to retain earnings, if
any, for the development and expansion of our business. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion
of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions
and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 

In
addition, due to various restrictions under PRC laws on the distribution of dividends by WFOE, we may not be able to pay dividends to
our shareholders. The Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Wholly-Foreign Owned Enterprise Law Implementing
Rules (1990), as amended, and the Company Law of the PRC (2006), contain the principal regulations governing dividend distributions by
wholly foreign owned enterprises. Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated
profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, such companies are required to
set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until such time as the accumulated
reserve funds reach and remain above 50 of the registered capital amount. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends except
in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries and affiliates in China
incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments.
If we or our subsidiaries and affiliates are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through the current contractual
arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock. 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plan 

On
August 22, 2018, our Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2018 Plan, to award up to a maximum
of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock, to attract and retain the best available personnel, provide additional incentives to employees,
directors and consultants and promote the success of our business. Subsequently, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8
to register the shares underlying the 2018 Plan. 

On
April 28, 2022, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company s 2018 Plan at to increase the number of shares

CEO s
Review: 

Datasea
achieved a number of new milestones in this fiscal year, while our net sales decreased to 7,045,311. The decline was partially due to
the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic. T he COVID-19 pandemic has adversely disrupted the supply
chain and negatively impacted the timing of the production and marketing of our ultrasonic products due to quarantines, facility closures,
and travel and logistics restrictions related to the outbreak. During the epidemic, the demand for our 5G messaging business has also
decreased due to the restrictions on the travel. 

The
decline of our net sales was also partially due to our strategic restructuring of our business lines. Datasea initially also carried
out businesses in the Smart City sector and developed underlying platforms based on Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence algorithm
to provide smart city solutions such as smart campus, smart community, smart scenic sites. However, in recent years, there has been vicious
competition in this industry, such as fighting for market share through massive losses, serious homogeneous competition, and unhealthy
and disorderly market development. This is contrary to the strategy and values of our company: we adopt the differentiation strategy
as well as strive for healthy and sustainable growth. We believe this strategic restructuring reflects our forward-looking vision and
correct values. 

Despite
these, I am pleased with our performance, including the continuous improvement of technology and research and development capabilities,
a wide range of acoustic product portfolio, the establishment of multiple marketing and sales channels and the cooperation of domestic
and international leading technology laboratories. A more important measure of our success than short-term revenue is the establishment
of Acoustic Intelligence as the core of our company s strategy. Datasea is the global initiator, promoter and practitioner of the
concept of acoustic intelligence, which sits on the integration of the acoustics and artificial intelligence. We will strive to make
achievements in three promising domains such as ultrasound, Schumann resonance technology and directional sound. 

Internationalization
has always been a crucial strategy for us. Datasea established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Datasea Acoustics LLC, based in the State of
Delaware, USA, which is a critical milestone of our company. We will introduce cutting-edge antiviral acoustic solutions to the U.S. market
and even the international market and also launch new products such as ultrasonic Skin Repair Robot and Schumann frequency sleep monitors
to meet the ever-increasing demands of the global market. Additionally, we can expand our product and service portfolio by engaging in
cross-border mergers and acquisitions or forming international joint ventures to meet evolving market demands worldwide. Identifying companies
that are related to or complementary to our current intelligent acoustics businesses can help us rapidly expand our business and market
scale globally. 

64 

We continue
to bring in additional investors to support our company s research and development, marketing and operations. On August 15, 2023,
Datasea entered into a subscription agreement with a non-U.S. investor to purchase an aggregate of 2,962,963 shares of common stock price
at a 1.35 per share purchase price, with a total subscription price of 4,000,000. The shares must be held for a period of
180 days. The investor shall pay the amount of 714,286 to our company, which has been received by our Company. On September 13, 2023,
our Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of
 0.40 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1.635 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering
expenses. In addition, our Company has granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 750,000 shares of common
stock at the public offering price per share. On September 21, 2023, our Company closed a new round of private financing, raising RMB40,000,000
at a price of 1.20 per share, and investors must hold their shares for 365 days. We believe these and future funding demonstrate our
investors confidence on our strategy and business. 

Despite
our progress, it is important to emphasize the significant uncertainty associated with each intermediate stage. As our business progresses
to the next stages, this variance is expected to decrease, but in the short term, the uncertainties and risks are not neglected. Our
international strategy and extensive project portfolio will continue to be our most important means of reducing these risks.

Our
Business Summary 

We
deeply understand that the market needs new application areas, new technologies, and new requirements. Therefore, through the relentless
efforts of our team, we transitioned from visual algorithms to non-visual algorithms with acoustics as the core and made significant
breakthroughs in the field of acoustics, including ultrasound, infrasound, and directional sound. 

66 

Acoustic
intelligence is a new field that integrates fundamental acoustic theory with artificial intelligence to gather and process acoustic data
and solve problems. Datasea leverages cutting-edge technologies in the realm of intelligent acoustics, especially harnessing the power
of ultrasonic sterilization to combat viruses and prevent human infections. This technology capitalizes on the mechanical, thermal, and
cavitation effects of ultrasound. When stimulated by ultrasound, microorganisms, including the coronavirus, undergo significant vibration
strains, disrupting the virus s outer shell and internal RNA. The rapid movement of protons in the ultrasound eventually devastates
microbial structures, annihilating harmful pathogens. 

Leveraging
Datasea s cutting-edge intelligent acoustics technology together with AI technology,we successfully developed a series of ultrasonic
disinfection products named the Hailijia series air sterilizer products. This lineup includes solutions tailored for in-door,
in-vehicle sterilization and deodorization, restroom and cloakroom purification and deodorization, comprehensive air disinfection, and
specialized sterilization suitable for environments such as hospitals, airports, hotels, transportation and residential settings. We started
to launch those new products in the China market in the year of 2023. Leading labs such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology have proven
this ultrasonic disinfection technology to have 99.83 efficacy in nine seconds against Covid-19 and 99.99 efficacy against Staphylococcus
Albus and E-col. Meanwhile, this strategic shift and process are aimed at offering people more effective solutions for purifying their
environments and healthier lifestyles for people not only in China, but also the United States and globally, particularly in the post-pandemic
era when people have raised higher demands for protection and quality of life. 

Additionally,
the Company makes innovations in Schumann frequency, directional sound and others, launching ultrasonic Skin Repair with AI diagnosis
and Schumann frequency sleep monitors and further creating a higher quality living environment for customers in application fields such
as acoustic antivirus, acoustic health, and acoustic agriculture. Also, with a diverse product lineup, we strive to achieve a global
leading position in this field within three years. 

In
a strategic move to demonstrate its presence in the global arena, Datasea established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Datasea Acoustics LLC,
in Delaware, USA, on July 31, 2023. This venture underlines Datasea s dedication to Intelligent Acoustics and marks
its ambition to offer advanced antiviral acoustic solutions at ultrasonic disinfection and sterilization,

67 

Recent
Developments 

Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health management, our Acoustic Intelligence and 5G Messaging businesses were both adversely
affected to varying degrees during the fiscal year. As the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply chain and impacted the timing of
the production and marketing of the Company s ultrasonic products due to quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics
restrictions related to the outbreak. In addition, d uring the
epidemic, the demand for our 5G messaging business has decreased in this fiscal year, and the restrictions on people s travel have
led to a significant reduction in travel, shopping and other travel consumption. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse
effect on our operations and the financial performance of our business. In early December 2022, China announced a nationwide relaxation
of the zero-coronavirus policy, and the recovery of consumption directly drove the company s 5G message top-up business
to achieve rapid growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak still depends on future mutations
of the virus, including new information about the severity of the global outbreak and the measures taken, or the emergence of new or
more severe strains that are highly uncertain and unpredictable. Therefore, while we do not expect the COVID-19 outbreak to have a negative
impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, the relevant financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at
this time. 

Our
Core Businesses 

Intelligent
Acoustics: 

Our
Opportunity 

Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become increasingly concerned about their health and the quality of the air in their surroundings.
This surge in demand for indoor and in-vehicle air purification, air disinfection, and odor removal has propelled the market into a period
of robust growth. Leveraging its proprietary technology and operational expertise in harnessing various core characteristics of ultrasound,
Datasea has benefited from the rapid development of the indoor environmental purification and air disinfection and sterilization industry
worldwide. 

The
collaborative technology of sonic and artificial intelligence is a disruptive applied technology in the skin repair market. Currently,
most of the existing ultrasonic facial beauty devices on the market utilize the strong penetrating power of ultrasound, capable of reaching
depths of 4 to 6mm beneath the skin s surface, to provide therapeutic treatments for facial skin whitening and texture improvement,
and they are contact-based. The company s contactless ultrasonic and AI skin repair technology and products, especially including
the artificial intelligence collaboration of intelligent control arm precision control and AI real-time diagnosis, are disruptive technology
applications for the skin repair market. This sector complements the current medical aesthetic industry, which includes six major segments
such as cleansing, moisturizing, whitening, spot removal, acne treatment, and anti-aging with significant market space. 

Currently,
there are relatively few similar technology applications and products related to contactless ultrasonic skin repair technology, directional
sound and Schumann resonance in the domestic market, leaving huge opportunities and gaps to be filled. 

The
broad application prospects of Schumann resonance collaborative technology. The natural frequency
magnetic field of Schumann resonance itself has the effect of relieving anxiety and stress, inducing brain waves to enter a deep sleep
state, effectively improving the quality of deep sleep, and keeping people away from insomnia. The Magnetic Induction of Brain Rhythm
(MIBR) technology, which is mastered by the Company, can create a natural frequency magnetic field similar to Schumann frequency by selectively
optimizing and regulating the function of neuronal cells through magnetic induction wave energy (MIBR). It can alleviate stress and solve
insomnia problems, and the application terminals of its technology are also portable and convenient to use, which has a great effect
on the improvement of sub-health problems in the global population. 

68 

Directional
sound is currently mainly applied in fields such as audio enhancement, sound system enhancement, and security and communication. Due
to technical bottlenecks, adaptability to application scenarios, and cost, there are relatively few similar technological applications
and products in the domestic market, and there are a large number of gaps and entry opportunities in the market. The Company has mastered
the principles and characteristics of directional sound propagation, as well as the development of corresponding scenario applications.
As a basic technology tool, directional sound s innovative collaboration with existing ultrasound and other technology applications
and products is expected to fill the market gap globally. 

Faced
with these promising market opportunities, the Company has proactively established a strategic presence in the field of acoustic intelligence.
We have strategically planned for technological advancements, specialized applications, product development, and customer orientation
within this domain. As a result of this strategic planning, the Company has rapidly launched ultrasonic-based antivirus equipment. This
includes our first-generation surface virus disinfection and sterilization products, as well as our second-generation air antivirus products
known as the Hailijia series. 

Industry
Position of acoustics business 

The Company holds a prominent position in the field of acoustics, particularly
in areas such as ultrasound, infrasound, and directional sound. To promote research and innovation in these areas, the Company actively
collaborates with several prominent research institutions and universities, including Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Acoustics,
China Academy of Information and Communications Technology Cloud Computing and Big Data Research Institute, Tsinghua University Internet
Industry Research Institute, Harbin Institute of Technology Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Beijing Union University, and
Jilin University Remote Sensing Research Institute. The Company, together with these partners, is dedicated to conducting research on
new topics and developing novel technology applications to drive advancements in the field of acoustics. To better achieve this goal,
the Company collaborated for seven joint laboratories to enhance the integration of research resources and cooperation. These collaborations
and the establishment of these laboratories further solidify the Company s leading position in the field of acoustics, providing
a strong foundation for future innovations and development. 

Additionally,
the Company, together with MIIT, Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence Key Technology and Application Evaluation and Informatization,
CAICT Cloud Computing Big Data Research Institute, released China s inaugural white paper on the acoustic intelligence industry.
The paper shares compelling analysis and fact findings on intelligent acoustics technology, the commercialization of the technology,

Market
Results 

Datasea
sells acoustic intelligence products through our direct sales team and a select network of distributors and online channel partners. Until
this fiscal year, Datasea has 6 channel partners and 4 OEMs, typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. From the beginning
of this fiscal year, we began to realize the sales of intelligent acoustics products Hailijia series air Air sterilizers. Direct
sales and distributors sales accounted for 49.48 and 50.52 of our 136,884 net revenue of the intelligent acoustics products for this
fiscal year, respectively. We believe aggregate sales of intelligent acoustics products, through all channels, accounted for approximately
1.94 of our total net revenue for this year. Due to the fact that the Company s HailiJia series of ultrasonic air
sterilization products were officially launched in the first half of 2023, the overall revenue scale has not yet increased significantly.

ESG
Management 

Datasea remains dedicated to integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations into our business operations and strategy.
We recognize that this approach is vital for effectively managing risks, identifying growth opportunities, and bolstering our long-term
resilience. Moreover, it helps us foster positive relationships with stakeholders and enhance our reputation, giving Datasea a competitive
advantage in an ever-evolving industry. 

As
part of our ongoing commitment to ESG, Datasea has adopted a comprehensive framework to align our operations with our values and priorities.
This framework guides our decision-making processes andemphasized sustainable growth and long-term success. 

Transparency
and accountability are central to our ESG approach. Starting from 2023, Datasea is committed to providing meaningful and accurate sustainability
information to our stakeholders. To achieve this, we will disclose information about our ESG practices and performance through quarterly
and annual ESG Reports and sustainability statements. 

Our
progress in ESG integration and reporting during this quarter includes the followings: 

ESG Evaluation: In the third
quarter of 2023, Datasea conducted a thorough ESG evaluation to assess our current performance and pinpoint areas for improvement. This
assessment was instrumental in understanding our ESG readiness and identifying our top ESG priorities. It served as the foundation for
developing our ESG roadmap and implementation plan. 

Datasea s
ESG priority assessment is a cornerstone of our commitment to ESG integration. It helps us focus on the most significant ESG issues for
both Datasea and our stakeholders. Our priorities span environmental, social, and governance dimensions, ensuring a well-rounded approach. 

72 

Key
ESG Priorities: Our assessment identified critical ESG priorities, including: 

o Environmental: Energy use and efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, water management, waste reduction,
and hazardous materials management. 

o Social: Inclusion, diversity, and non-discrimination, talent recruitment, development, and retention,
employee health and safety, and supply chain. 

o Governance: Ethics and integrity, corporate governance, cybersecurity, data privacy, and product quality. 

These priorities align with our commitment
to minimizing our environmental impact, enhancing social well-being, and ensuring strong governance practices. 

By
focusing our efforts on these priorities, we aim to have a meaningful impact on our stakeholders and the environment. Datasea remains
dedicated to implementing our 2023 ESG program and initiatives effectively to address these priorities and achieve our ESG objectives.
While there have been no recent reports released, we continue our commitment to ESG integration, striving for continuous improvement
and transparency in our sustainability efforts. We look forward to sharing our progress and achievements with our stakeholders in upcoming
ESG Reports and communications. 

Competition 

It
is important to note that acoustic technology is a broad and diverse field. Different acoustic characteristics may find extensive applications
in various niche sectors and different application areas may have distinct market competitive landscapes. Large tech companies like Baidu,
Alibaba, Tencent, and others have also invested in acoustic-related technologies, which could potentially influence market dynamics in
the future. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand
their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors,
including progressiveness technology, product safety and other characteristics such as price and brand. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which
contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the
years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a net loss of approximately 9.48 million and 6.52 million, respectively. The Company
had an accumulated deficit of approximately 28.06 million as of June 30, 2023, and negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately
 3.14 million and 5.14 million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The historical operating results indicate the
Company has recurring losses from operations which raise the question related to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
although the range of such recurring operating losses has narrowed in recent years. There can be no assurance the Company will become
profitable or obtain necessary financing for its business and investments or that it will be able to continue in business and investments.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. As of
June 30, 2023, the Company had cash of 19,728. 

We continue to bring in additional
investors to support our company s research and development, marketing and operations. On August 1, 2023, the Company entered into
two separate subscription agreements with a certain non-U.S. investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the investor agreed
to purchase an aggregate of 4,760,000 shares of common stock price at a 1.2 per share purchase price. Such shares must be held for a
period of 365 days. In accordance with such two agreements, Investor A shall pay a total purchase price of 5,712,000 in RMB, at an amount
of RMB 40,000,000, no later than September 30, 2023. On September 21, the Company has received all of the payment of RMB 40,000,000. On
August 15, 2023, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with a non-U.S. investor to purchase an aggregate of 2,962,963 shares
of common stock price at a 1.35 per share purchase price, with a total subscription price of 4,000,000. The shares must be
held for a period of 180 days. On September 13, 2023, our Company announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 5,000,000
shares of common stock at a public offering price of 0.40 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of 1,635,000, after deducting underwriting
discounts and other offering expenses. We believe these fundings demonstrate our investors confidence on our strategy and business. 

73 

If
deemed necessary, management could seek to raise additional funds by the way of introducing strategic investors or private or public
offerings, or by obtaining loans from banks or others, to support the Company s research and development,
procurement, marketing and daily operation. However, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed
from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. We may be required to pursue sources of additional
capital through various means, including debt or equity financings. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive
to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in the future capital transactions may be more favorable for new
investors. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal
fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by
such factors as the capital markets and our history of losses, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the
amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy
our capital needs, even to the extent that we reduce our operations accordingly, we may be required to cease operations.

Revenues 

We
had revenues of 7,045,311 and 17,080,911 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which shows a 10,035,600 or 59 
decrease by comparing with the same period of 2022. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to during the global COVID-19 pandemic situation
the reduced demand for 5G SMS business in China, the decrease of the revenue from 5G messaging. For the year ended June 30, 2023, revenues
mainly consisted of service fees from our 5G SMS service platform and Cloud Platform construction project. For the year ended June 30,
2022, revenues mainly consisted of service fees from our 5G SMS service platform. 

From
July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, the Company generated revenue of 7,045,311, including 6,686,691 from the 5G messaging business and
 196,940 from the acoustic intelligence business, and 161,680 from other business. 

From
July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the Company generated 17,080,911 revenue, which consisted of 5G message business with an amount of 17,024,695,
including 11,937,189 from 5G SMS and 1,825,547 from 5G IMMCP and 3,261,959 from aggregate message cloud as value-added service; and
 56,216 from other projects. 

During
the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company significantly reduced 5G SMS business due to the low gross profit margin and focused on
developing the customers who can make prepayment for 5G SMS. At the same time, the Company
expands the layout of intelligent acoustic s products . 

Cost
of Revenues 

We
recorded 6,704,380 and 16,125,238 cost of revenues for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which shows a 9,420,858
or 58 decrease by comparing with the same period of 2022. For the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, cost of revenues was mainly the
5G SMS service platform fees and Cloud Platform construction to suppliers. The decrease in cost of revenues was due mainly to the decrease
sales of 5G SMS. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the cost of 5G messaging was 6.57 million, the cost of intelligent acoustics business
was 115,143, and the cost of other business was 14,844. 

Operating
costs incurred from July 2021 to June 2022 were 16,125,238, and cost of 5G messaging service was 16,091,903 including 11,578,298 for
5G SMS, 3,091,548 for 5G IMMCP and mobile on cloud projects; 1,422,056 for advertising service, and 33,335 for other projects. These
costs were the service procurement costs corresponding to the full operation of the business lines of the Company. Among them, 5G messaging
business has entered a period of rapid growth, and cost of procurement accounts for 99.8 of the overall procurement cost. 

Gross
Profit 

Gross
profit for the year ended June 30, 2023 was 340,931 compared to 955,673 for the year ended June 30, 2022, which shows a 614,742 or
64 decrease by comparing with the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to the decrease in delivery
of services related to the 5G SMS service platform in 2023. 

Gross
margin is 4.8 for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 5.6 for the year ended June 30, 2022. 

As
China officially enters the 5G era, China s 5G network construction will usher in new opportunities and bring revolutionary changes
to domestic economic and social development and production and life. application scenarios supported by 5G are expanding from
the Mobile Internet to the Mobile Internet of Things, and a new generation of high-speed, mobile, secure and ubiquitous information infrastructure
will be built. At the same time, 5G will accelerate the digital transformation of many industries and social life. 

Combining
the advantages of Internet of Things+ intelligent terminals and 5G messaging industry chain, Shuhai Information is advancing
with the time, taking the train of the 5G era, and developing 5G message/phone top up business. At this stage, Shuhai is carrying out
the development, operation and promotion services of the Internet of Things market and increasing the effective combination of resources
with Mobile Internet enterprises and the Internet of Things industrial chain. 

In
2023, the 5G phone recharge business of Shuhai Information accounts for a relatively big proportion of the total revenue, because, at
this stage, the business belongs to the early stage of the development, operation and promotion services of the Internet of Things market,
and the investment in all aspects is large. In addition, the gross profit of the phone charge recharging business is generally low. As
a result, the annual gross profit margin decreased from the previous year. The Company s focus in this business is to integrate
new resources, expand new businesses related to 5G, combine the Company s years of deep cultivation and accumulation in 5G news,
and take this opportunity to open up more 5G-related businesses to increase the Company s revenue and new business. 

75 

In
China s mature and transparent market today, gross margins on services are far greater than those on hardware sales. The improvement
of gross profit margin shows that the Company s measures to improve gross profit margin are gradually showing effect: 1) costs
will be reduced by economic scale over a larger number of customers base and the increase in production; 2) the Company, by adopting
the differentiation strategy, grows brand recognition and customer loyalty, strengthening the Company s pricing power; 3) after
the commercialization of 5G messaging in the Chinese market (expected in the fourth quarter of 2022), the targeted customers and product
will be expanded. For example, the Company will provide the 5G IMMCP as SaaS software, customized and value-added services to improve
profit margin. The Company will continue to increase the share of high gross profit products in the sales while increasing the revenue,
so as to further improve the gross profit rate and give investors a better return on investment. 

Selling,
General and Administrative, and Research and Development Expenses 

Selling
expenses were 690,731 and 1,358,203 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing an decrease of 667,472
or 49 . The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in payroll expense of salespersons by 354,507, decreased meal and entertainment
expense by 13,776, decreased meeting expense by 11,541, decreased service fee by 364,608, and decreased other selling expenses by
 41,626, which was partly offset by increased advertising and marketing fee by 118,420. 

Currently,
we are focusing on expanding the Company s leading intelligent acoustics technologies and products and continuing to develop 5G-related
applications. We incurred R D expenses of 921,020 and 1,259,739 during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which
shows a 338,719 or 27 decrease by comparing with the same period of 2022. 

Research
and development expenses of 921,020and intangible assets increased by 80,438 for year ended June 30, 2023. The company s research
and develop results include but are not limited to the following: 

5G
Messaging Marketing cloud platform (5G MMCP), updated 5G Integrated Messaging Marketing cloud platform (5G IMMCP) and smart push .
5G IMMCP expands connection with existing clients through accesses such as SMS, email, WeChat, applet, APP Push and third-party tools
and manage users from different platforms all in one 5G IMMCP solution. Smart Push, a precision marketing solution powered by 5G messaging
technology with broad applicability to serve companies of all sizes and helps enterprise clients send personalized messages at scale
to a captive audience and engage in one-on-one conversations that may lead to conversions, sales, and customer loyalty. 

Datasea s
acoustic intelligence sets have passed the certification of the third-party authoritative institutions that has proven to achieve a 99.83 
efficacy in nine seconds against Covid-19. At present, a complete set of intelligent acoustics product system has been formed: 

Building
on Datasea s advanced intelligent acoustics technology, the Company developed five models under the brand Hailijia, 
including products meant for in-vehicle sterilization and deodorization, restroom sterilization and deodorization, air disinfection,
and air disinfection and sterilization meant for locations such as hospitals, airports, logistics warehouses, cold chain transportation,
and home care. 

With
the wide acceptance of 5G applications across the country, especially the acceleration of digitalization and intelligent construction
in the Chinese business community has led to a rapid increase in the demand for smart-related systems and promotion services based on
5G technology in the Chinese market. This is because there are more than 48.42 million enterprises and business of all types and over
99 are SMEs. 

As
a useful way to defense the respiratory infectious disease, Shuhai s Hailijia ultrasonic air disinfection equipment
is able to meet various disinfection needs and help protect families, staff, patients, students and visitors in private homes or public
places. It is expected to usher in a wider market breakout period and the rapid growth of revenue. 

General
and administration expenses increased 2,839,415, or 51 from 5,574,985 during the year ended June 30, 2022 to 8,414,400 during the
year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was mainly attributed to the increase in stock compensation expense by 3,736,887 which was partly
offset by decreased bad debt expense by 209,616, decreased meal and entertainment expense by 137,821, decreased rent expense by 247,774,
decreased payroll expense by 80,438, decreased professional fee by 152,059 and decreased other G A expenses by 69,762. 

76 

The Company has more accurate and scientific management methods in
personnel costs and risk control. We take human capital as a key indicator to promote business growth and technological innovation by
improving efficiency. By downsizing the numbers of non-core position staff, the Company manages to control expenses, while does not affect
the work efficiency and efficiency in any way. At the same time the Company strives to pursue better integration channel with related
industries, i.e., outsourcing sales branch for Acoustic products and establishing joint venture to obtain the investment to 5G messaging
technology area. 

In
order to further improve research and development, office environment, and work efficiency, while reducing rent costs and increasing
asset size, the Company plans to issue stocks to the actual controller of the Company to purchase office assets. The plan to purchase
office assets is expected to be implemented in the near future. 

We
are treating the human capital as a key indicator to drive the business growth and technical innovation, also pursuing better integrated
channels with related industries.

or 45 increase by comparing with the same period of 2022. The increase in net loss was mainly due to the increase in operating expenses
and decreased gross profit as explained above. 

Accounts
receivable 

The operating revenue of the year ended June 30, 2023 was 7,045,311,
the balance of accounts receivable was 255,725 at June 30, 2023. In the same period last year, the operating revenue was 17,080,911,
and the accounts receivable balance was 259,410 at June 30, 2022. This year, the Company further segmented the market, planned eight
regional headquarters, strengthened the collection control, and promoted the fund collection of contracted delivery projects, which led
to the benign return of funds and had a far-reaching impact on the future. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Historically,
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock and shareholder loans. To enhance our ability to continue
to operate as a going concern, we are dedicating resources to generate recurring revenues and sustainable operating cash flows. 

We
expect to generate revenues through expanding our current 5G messaging and acoustic intelligence business, and through continuous product
innovation and development as well as various types of value-added services. In order to maintain working capital sufficient to support
our operations and finance the future growth of our business, we expect to fund any cash flow shortfall through financial support from
our majority stockholders (who are also our board members or officers) and public or private issuance of securities. However, such additional
cash resources may not be available to us on desirable terms, or at all, if and when needed by us. 

As of June 30, 2023, we had working capital deficit of 3,617,058 or
a current ratio of 0.26:1. Our current assets were 1,289,517. As of June 30, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of 867,774 or a
current ratio of 0.59:1, and our current assets were 1,256,801. 

We
expect the Company to continue to support its ongoing operations and financing through revenue growth and increased financing activities.
However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional working capital on commercially viable terms or
at all.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and acting
principal financial officer, respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of such date because of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting as described
below.

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, is collectively responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for Datasea, and has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Because of the weaknesses described in the following paragraphs, management believes that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective due to the presence of the following weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting which are indicative of many small companies with a small staff: (i) the segregation of duties in several departments is not
clear enough; (ii) the testing cycle for the effectiveness of internal control measures should be shortened and the frequency be increased;
(iii) lack of accounting personal trained in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle of United States. 

Management s
Strategies for Enhancing Internal Control: 

In
the previous fiscal year, we recognized the weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have taken proactive steps
to enhance and refine our internal control framework. These initiatives primarily include: 

1. Continuous
Improvement of Internal Control Procedures: We remain committed to refining our internal control processes, encompassing various aspects
such as the budget approval process, procurement and asset management, credit control, internal audits, and cost accounting. Additionally,
we have compiled a comprehensive internal control policy, incorporating guidelines for procurement control, inventory management, and
fraud prevention. 

2. Collaborative
Oversight Mechanism: To strengthen internal control implementation, we have established a collaborative mechanism between the internal
control department and the legal department. This mechanism involves conducting interviews with department heads, promptly addressing
identified risk areas, and ensuring corrective actions are taken. 

3. Engagement
with Financing Underwriters: We have engaged financing underwriters to work closely with our international department to facilitate the
company s financing efforts. This partnership aims to improve our understanding of investor backgrounds and identify financing
methods that align best with our objectives. 

4. Enhanced
Collaboration with Legal Professionals: We are reinforcing collaboration between our internal and external legal teams to proactively
mitigate risks. 

In
addition to these efforts, we have adopted various internal control policies, including the review of accounting personnel duties and
responsibilities, travel allowances, reimbursement procedures, receivable management, asset control, internal audit processes, and cost
accounting. Furthermore, we have established an internal audit department under the leadership of a director of internal audit, along
with a legal team, to ensure compliance and effective risk management. 

Further
Enhancements Include: 

5. Personnel
Training: We are committed to training our staff to ensure the proper execution of internal control policies and procedures. 

6. Regular
Reporting to the Audit Committee: We will continue to provide quarterly summaries of internal control and audit reports to the Audit
Committee. 

7. Quarterly
Review with U.S. CPA: Each quarter, we will conduct a trial balance review in collaboration with a U.S. Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
after their review or audit. 

Specifically
we have also implemented the following practices to enhance Datasea featured internal control system: 

1.
Projects Pre-approval: 

We
have carried out project development at irregular intervals according to the needs of business development. Before the project is officially
initiated, we have organized the setup of the project review group. The project review group has mainly reviewed the project s
market development prospect report, project proposal, project report and other documentations that are prepared by the project development
team. After communication and discussion by the review team, the project will be formally approved. 

81 

2.
Significant Issues: 

Significant
issues will go through meetings of the President s Office. During those meetings, the Company s strategic adjustments of the business
and major projects or events will be discussed. Only after the board meeting or the resolution of the board of directors, the decisions
will be implemented in accordance with the meetings. 

3.
HR Management, Responsibility, Rewards and Penalties System: 

We
have strict control over talents and their efficiency, from the probation period to the conversion to regular employees. After the employees
passing the strict evaluation, they will be included in the regular employees pool and sign the job responsibility letter and performance
commitment letter. They will go through monthly performance assessment and evaluation as the basis for salary settlement. We will give
rewards to employees with excellent performance from time to time, and the rewards are not limited to cash and stocks. We also gives certain
penalty measures for employees work mistakes, such as deduction of performance-based salary. 

4.
Budget Management: 

The
internal control department organizes all departments to participate in the full budget formulation and budget implementation, and comprehensively
develop and implement the annual full budget data according to funds, assets, project initiation, business line revenue, and costs. The
internal control center strictly controls the budget. The execution department, the finance department, the CEO and the chairman of the
board jointly approve and execute the budget. In the process of budget implementation, we adopt the monthly rolling budget system, and
the Group financial management internal control center makes statistical analysis of the implementation results to help each business
unit complete the performance targets and strive to achieve the annual target of the Group company. 

5.
Operation Management: 

We
combine centralized and decentralized management styles according to the business line types and operating characteristics of each subsidiary
of the group. We will give our subsidiaries certain management rights so that we will not miss any business opportunities. In terms of
production and operation, from project initiation, procurement to sales, we have a complete control process. For example, before purchasing,
we need to look around in the market and select high-quality suppliers after the audit of the group s financial management internal control
center. We are willing to build long-term stable and friendly cooperation with high-quality suppliers. We will develop a complete process
from the product check-in to check-out. After the approval of all parties, the procedure of product check-out will be completed to avoid
risks. 

6.
Business Development Personnel Management: 

For
excellent business development personnel, we formulate relevant royalty management measures with comprehensive considerations about different
lines of business, different products combined with different market conditions. We distribute salary and bonus according to performance.
Business development personnel who successfully complete the sales target can get generous remuneration. These measures actively motivate
business development personnel to complete the group s annual performance goals. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

and propose new potential director nominees to the Board of Directors for consideration and review our corporate governance policies. 

Independence
of the Board 

As required under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards, a majority
of the members of a listed company s Board of Directors must qualify as independent, as affirmatively determined by
the Board of Directors. Our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each
director concerning her or his background, employment, and affiliations, our board has determined that Stephen Wong, Michael James Antonoplos,
and Yang Yan do not have relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the listing requirements and
rules of Nasdaq. 

In
making this determination, the Board found that none of these directors had a material or other disqualifying relationship with the Company.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 

Datasea
Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Datasea Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and
2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Going
Concern - Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

The
Company had an accumulated deficit of 28.06 million and incurred a net loss from operations of approximately 9.48 million as of and
for the year end June 30, 2023. The Company has had recurring losses from operations which has raised substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal procedures to address this matter were to obtain cash flow forecast from the Company, evaluate the reasonableness of the forecast,
and test the receipt of cash subsequent to June 30, 2023. The Company received 7.83 million subsequent to June 30, 2023. This alleviated
the going concern uncertainty at least for a period of twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements.

of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the U.S. entity had net operating loss NOL carry forwards for income tax purposes of million
and million. The NOL arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may reduce of a taxpayer s taxable income, and
be carried forward indefinitely. Management believes the realization of benefits from these
losses remains uncertain due to the parent Company s limited operating history and continuing losses. Accordingly, a 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance was provided. 

The
Company s offshore subsidiary, Shuhai Skill (HK), a HK holding company is subject to corporate income tax in HK. Shuhai
Beijing received a tax holiday with a corporate income tax rate since it qualified as a high-tech company. Tianjin Information,
Xunrui, Guozhong Times, Guozhong Haoze, Guohao Century, Jingwei, Shuhai Nanjing, Zhangxun are subject to the regular PRC income
tax rate. 

As
of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has approximately million and million of NOL from its HK holding company, PRC
subsidiaries and VIEs that expire in calendar years 2021 through 2025. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization
of deferred tax assets depends upon the Company s future generation of taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences
representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all the information available,
management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore
established a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.
