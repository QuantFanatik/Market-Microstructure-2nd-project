PART I 

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS. 

Corporate Background 
 
 The Company was originally incorporated on December 8, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada as Elan Development, Inc. On April 25, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to Star Gold Corp. Star Gold Corp. is a pre-development stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of precious metal deposit properties and advancing them toward production. The Company is engaged in the business of exploring, evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals. 
 
 Star Gold Corp. originally leased with an option to acquire certain unpatented mining claims located in the State of Nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the Longstreet Property (or the Longstreet Project ). The Longstreet Property in its entirety comprises 142 mineral claims: 75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers, pursuant to the Clifford Lease as well as 50 claims subsequently staked by Star Gold. The Longstreet Property covers a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha). The Longstreet Project is at an intermediate stage of exploration. 
 
 The Company has no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance. The business is not of a seasonal nature. Because minerals are traded in the open market, the Company has little to no control over the competitive conditions in the industry. 
 
 Overview of Mineral Exploration and Current Operations 
 
 Star Gold Corp. is a pre-development stage mineral company with no producing mines. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. The Company acquires properties which it believes have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims, or private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest, that can be acquired, in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management. The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities. 
 
 The Company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). The Company may enter joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is the Company s plan to focus on assembling a high-quality group of mid-stage mineral (primarily gold and silver) exploration prospects, using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, the Company means properties that have been previously identified by third parties, (including prior owners and/or exploration companies), as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. Geographic emphasis will be placed on the western United States. 
 
 The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified on the Longstreet Property. The Company s property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, the Company seeks to acquire, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, the Company then typically makes a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on a property.

(4) 
 The Company shall pay Clifford a 2 net smelter royalty on net smelter returns which is inclusive of the overall 3 net smelter royalty for the properties. 

Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
 Continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of Nevada will require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Nevada and the United States Federal agencies. 
 
 United States 
 
 Mining in the State of Nevada is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Company s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment. 
 
 Land Ownership and Mining Rights. 
 
 On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining Law) as amended, 30 U.S.C. 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances. 
 
 Mining Operations 
 
 The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. 
 
 The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, which is referred to as the NDEP, is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the Nevada property. Local jurisdictions (such as Eureka County) may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).

Table of Contents 

Environmental Law 
 
 The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of the Company s operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to the Company s proposed operations may be encountered. The Company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Unless and until a mineral resource is proved, it is unlikely Star Gold Corp. operations will move beyond the pre-development stage. If in the future the Company decides to proceed beyond exploration, there will be numerous notifications, permit applications, and other decisions to be addressed at that time. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Star Gold Corp. competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and for equipment and labor related to exploration and development of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact Star Gold Corp. s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties. 
 
 The Company provides no assurance it will be able to compete in any of its business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Office and Other Facilities 
 
 Star Gold Corp. currently maintains its administrative offices at 1875 N. Lakeview Drive, Suite 303 Coeur d Alene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (208) 664-5066. Star Gold Corp. does not currently own title to any real property. 
 
 Employees 
 
 The Company has no employees as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Star Gold Corp. conducts business largely through independent contractor agreements with consultants. 
 
 Research and Development Expenditures 
 
 The Company has not incurred any research expenditures since incorporation. 
 
 Reports to Security Holders 
 
 The Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly reports to security holders other than the annual Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the SEC. Electronically filed reports may be accessed at www.sec.gov 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS. 

The following factors, among others, could cause the actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time. 
 
 Estimates of mineralized material are forward-looking statements inherently subject to error. Although resource estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the estimates are made, unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or positive impacts on the estimates. Actual results may inherently differ from estimates. The unforeseen and uncontrollable factors include but are not limited to: geologic uncertainties including inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters, and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations. The timing and effects of variances from estimated values cannot be accurately predicted.

Table of Contents 

Failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of the Company s common stock may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Star Gold Corp. cannot ensure that the Company will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect its business. 
 
 Risks Related to the Company 
 
 The Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of the business and prospects 
 
 The Company has not derived any revenue from exploration of its properties. The Company s operating history has been limited to the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Such history does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of its prospects for success if future determinations are made that mineral reserves exist and to commence construction and operation of a mine. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, the Company has no additional means to evaluate the likelihood of whether its mineral property contains any mineral reserve or, if they do, that it will be operated successfully. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating costs without realizing any operating revenues during the period it explores existing and any future acquired properties. 
 
 During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of 424,840 in connection with the maintenance and exploration of its mineral properties and the operation of the exploration business. The Company therefore expects to continue to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. The Company recognizes that if it is unable to generate significant revenues from mining operations and dispositions of its properties, the Company will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. At this early stage of operations, the Company expects to face the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at the development stage of their business. The Company cannot ensure it will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and the failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that the Company will prove successful and the Company can provide investors no assurance that we will generate any operating revenue or ever achieve profitable operations. 
 
 Investors interests in the Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share if the Company issues additional employee/director/consultant options or if the Company sells additional shares to finance its operation. 
 
 The Company has not generated any operational revenues from the exploration of any properties. In order to further expand the Company s business and meet its objectives, including but not limited to, obtaining funds to further explore the Company s existing properties or to finance any acquisition activity, growth and/or additional exploration programs, should those opportunities present themselves, and depending on the outcome of its exploration programs, additional capital funding may need to be obtained through the sale and issuance of additional equity, debt or derivative securities. The Company may also, in the future, grant to some or all of its directors, officers, insiders and key employees/consultants, options or other rights to acquire common or preferred shares in the Company as non-cash incentives. The issuance of any additional equity securities could cause then-existing stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests. 
 
 Should the Company issue additional shares to finance its business activities, investors interests in the Company may be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. As of the date of the filing of this report there are outstanding 2,000,000 Common Share purchase warrants exercisable into 2,000,000 shares of common stock , 3,435,000options granted that are exercisable into 3,435,000 shares of common stock, and 462,500 of promissory notes convertible to 19,562,370 shares of common stock. If these are exercised or converted, these would represent approximately 20.4 of the Company s then issued and outstanding shares. If all the warrants and options are exercised and the underlying shares issued, such issuance would cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the market price of the Company s shares. 
 
 Conflicts of interest 
 
 Certain of the Company s officers and directors may be or become associated with other businesses, including natural resource companies that acquire interests in properties. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interests from time to time. The Company s directors are required by law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the Company s best interests and to disclose any interest, which they may have in any of the Company s projects or opportunities. In general, if a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the Board of Directors, any director in a conflict will disclose their interest and abstain from voting on such matter or, if the director does vote, that vote will not be counted.

Table of Contents 

Dependence on Key Management Personnel 
 
 The Company s ability to continue exploration and development activities and to develop a competitive edge in the marketplace depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain such personnel. The Company s development now, and in the future, will depend on the effort of key executives such as Lindsay Gorrill, Kelly Stopher, and David Segelov. The loss of any of these key people could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. In addition, the Company has expanded the provisions of its stock option plan so the Company can provide incentive for the key personnel. 
 
 Failure to obtain additional financing 
 
 Unless and until the Company can generate revenues from operations, the Company s main potential continuing source of funds will be additional debt and/or equity financings which may not be sufficient to sustain operations. There is no guarantee that the Company, if needed, will be able to raise additional funds through debt and/or equity financing or that any such financing will be able to be obtained on terms beneficial to the Company. If Star Gold Corp. is unsuccessful in raising additional funds, the Company will not be able to develop its properties and may be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Company Directors and Officers own 29,368,668 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock (30.2 w hich may cause corporate decisions influenced by the Directors and Officers to appear to be inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. 
 
 Company directors and/or officers as a group control a combined 30.2 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, while none of the current directors and/or officers (individually or collectively) can control, as shareholders, who is elected to the Board of Directors, since these individuals are not simply passive investors but are also active members of Company management, their interests as directors and/or officers and shareholders may, at times, be adverse to those interests of merely passive investors. Where those conflicts exist, stockholders will be dependent upon management exercising their fiduciary duties as members of the Board of Directors and/or as an officer. Also, due to their stock ownership position, members of the Company s management team will have: (i) the ability to substantially influence the outcome of many (if not most) corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including amendments to the Company s Articles of Incorporation; and (ii) the ability to substantially influence corporate combinations or similar transactions that might benefit minority stockholders which may not be supported by management to the detriment of smaller and/or passive investors. 
 
 There is substantial risk that no commercially viable mineral deposits will be found due to speculative nature of mineral exploration. 
 
 Exploration for commercially viable mineral deposits is a speculative venture involving substantial risk. Star Gold cannot provide investors with assurance that any of its mining claim contains commercially viable mineral deposits. The exploration program that the Company will conduct on its claim may not result in the discovery of commercially viable mineral deposits. Problems such as unusual and unexpected rock formations and other conditions are involved in mineral exploration and often result in unsuccessful exploration efforts. In such a case, the Company may be unable to complete its business plan and investors could lose their entire investment. 
 
 Due to the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that the Company may incur liability or damages as it conducts its business. 
 
 The search for minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, Star Gold Corp. may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which the Company cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Star Gold Corp. currently has no such insurance nor does the Company expect to acquire such insurance for the foreseeable future. If a hazard were to occur, the costs of rectifying the hazard may exceed the Company s asset value and cause management to liquidate all the Company s assets resulting in the loss of a stockholder s entire investment.

Exploration efforts may be adversely affected by metals price volatility causing the Company to cease exploration efforts. 
 
 The Company has no earnings from operations. However, the success of any exploration effort is derived from the price of metals which are affected by numerous factors including: 1) expectations for inflation; 2) investor speculative activities: 3) relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies; 4) global and regional demand and production; 5) global and regional political and economic conditions; and 6) production costs in major producing regions. These factors are beyond the Company s control and are impossible for the Company to accurately predict. 
 
 There is no guarantee that current favorable prices for metals and other commodities will be sustained. If the market prices for these commodities fall the Company may suspend or cease exploration efforts. 
 
 Governmental regulation and environmental risks 
 
 The Company s business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing mining exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, use of toxic substances, environmental regulations, mine safety and other matters. New legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that results in additional operating expense, capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the exploration, mining, production or development of its properties. 
 
 Permitting and Studies 
 
 The Company is subject to governmental requirements related to permitting and preparation of various studies related to the impact of mining projects on the flora, fauna, the environment and physical areas in and around the area proposed to be mined. There are no guarantees that any studies, the Company is required to prepare, will be favorable to the Company s intent to mine any project it develops, nor are there any guarantees that the Company will receive all, or any, of the permits needed for it to mine any project it develops. 
 
 Internal control, fraud detection and financial reporting 
 
 Should the Company fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, it may not be able to detect fraud or report financial results accurately, which could harm the business and could subject the Company to regulatory scrutiny. 
 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 ), the Company is required to perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is not required to have an independent registered public accounting firm test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of such internal controls and publicly attest to such evaluation. Continuing compliance with the requirements of Section 404 is expected to be expensive and time-consuming. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company s operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations. 
 
 Risks Associated with the Company s common stock 
 
 Star Gold Corp. stock is a penny stock; stockholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock. 
 
 The shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock constitute penny stocks under the Exchange Act. The shares will remain classified as a penny stock for the foreseeable future. The classification as a penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker/dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker/dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares will be subject to rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Exchange Act. Rather than having to comply with these rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell a penny stock. 
 
 The penny stock rules adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act subjects the sale of the shares of the Company s common stock to certain regulations which impose sales practice requirements on broker/dealers. For example, brokers/dealers selling such securities must, prior to effecting the transaction, provide their customers with a document that discloses the risks of investing in such securities. 
 
 Legal remedies, which may be available to an investor in penny stocks, are as follows: 

a) 
 if penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of his or her rights listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel his or her purchase and get his or her money back. 

b) 
 if the stocks are sold in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that caused the fraud for damages 

c) 
 if the investor has signed an arbitration agreement, however, he or she may have to pursue his or her claims through arbitration.

Table of Contents 

If the person purchasing the securities is someone other than an accredited investor or an established customer of the broker/dealer, the broker/dealer must also approve the potential customer s account by obtaining information concerning the customer s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. The broker/dealer must also decide whether the transaction is suitable for the customer and whether the customer has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be reasonably expected to be capable of evaluating the risk of transactions in such securities. Accordingly, the SEC s rules may limit the number of potential purchasers of the shares of Star Gold Corp. common stock. 
 
 The Company s stock price has been volatile and stockholder investment in the Company s common stock could suffer a decline in value. 
 
 The Company s common stock is quoted via the OTC Markets. The market price of the Company s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control. These factors include price fluctuations of precious metals, government regulations, disputes regarding mining claims, broad stock market fluctuations and economic conditions in the United States. 
 
 Although the Company s common stock is currently quoted via the OTC Markets, there are no assurances any public market for the Company s common stock will continue. There are also no assurances as to the depth or liquidity of any such market or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares. An investment in these shares may be totally illiquid and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment readily or at all when they need or desire to sell. 
 
 The Company does not intend to pay any dividends on shares of common stock in the near future. 
 
 The Company does not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to its stockholders in the near future, and any future decision as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company s earnings, financial position, capital requirements, plans for expansion and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. It is the Company s intention to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to finance the growth and development of the business.

ITEM 2. 
 PROPERTIES. 

The Company headquarters are located at 1875 N. Lakeview Drive, Suite 303, Coeur d Alene, Idaho, 83814. The Company believes this office space and facilities are sufficient to meet the Company s present needs, and do not anticipate any difficulty securing alternative or additional space, as needed, on terms acceptable to the Company. 
 
 The Company currently does not own any real property. 
 
 The Company is a pre-development stage company with no proven or probable mineral reserves. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists at the Longstreet Property. Further exploration will be required before any final determination as to the economic or legal feasibility may be made as to the Company s property. 
 
 THE LONGSTREET PROPERTY 
 
 In January of 2010 Star Gold signed an agreement (the Longstreet Agreement to lease with an option to acquire from MinQuest, Inc. MinQuest ), 60 unpatented mining claims totaling approximately 490 hectares. The Company completed its first phase of drilling in 2011. On July 9, 2010, the Company and MinQuest entered into an amended agreement to add an additional 10 claims and expanded the total to 70 unpatented claims. In addition, Star Gold agreed to reimburse MinQuest for 5 claims leased from a third party, Roy Clifford. The Longstreet Property comprises 142 mineral claims (75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims acquired from local ranchers (Roy Clifford et al)), as well as 50 claims subsequently staked by Star Gold, covering a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) (Figure 6-1). The claims are located within Sections 9-17, 20, and 21 of T6N, R47E, MDB M (Mount Diablo Base Line Meridian), Nye County. The entire 142 claims (the 5 claims covered by the Clifford Lease are not subject to the Longstreet Agreement) comprise the Longstreet Property.

On July 25, 2017, MinQuest assigned, conveyed and transferred to Great Basin Resources, Inc. Great Basin all of the rights, title and interest of Minquest in and to the Longstreet Property and the Longstreet Agreement. 
 
 On September 10, 2020, Great Basin Resources, Inc. recorded a quit claim deed transferring title to the Longstreet Property claims to Star Gold Corp. 
 
 On March 18, 2022, Great Basin Resources, Inc. recorded an amended quitclaim deed and assignment correcting the mineral claims previously transferred and memorializing the assignment of the Clifford leases. 
 
 Of the 50 claims staked by Star Gold, 38 are adjacent to the eastern boundary of the property and were staked with the objective of providing a site for potential leach pads planned for future development of the Main Zone (the Leach Pad Claims ). The remaining 12 claims staked by Star Gold lie along a corridor leading from the main Longstreet property to the Leach Pad Claims.

The Longstreet project is located 48 kilometers southeast of the Round Mountain Mine in Nevada. Longstreet is a Round Mountain style volcanic-hosted gold deposit. The first vein mapping program ever done at Longstreet was completed in October 2002. This work disclosed that gold-bearing veins at Main, as well as 6 other targets in the project area are steeply dipping. Most of the previous drilling was vertical. This indicates high potential to increase continuity, tonnage and grade of the resource. Surface geochemical sampling of veins from all the currently defined targets found gold values up to 18.1 g/t. As at Round Mountain the property contains strong potential for both open pit heap-leachable and high-grade millable ore. No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet s proximity to Round Mountain. Comparison to this and other historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics. 
 
 History: The Longstreet Property was discovered in the early 1900 s but had limited development work until 1929. A 1929 report and maps show development of the Golden Lion Mine on two levels spaced 75 meters apart vertically. The report indicates development of 300,000 tons of vein material averaging 0.20 oz/ton (6.8 g/t) gold and 8 oz/ton (274 g/t) silver. A mill was constructed, the remnants of which are still on the property. However, the small stopes underground indicate very little mining was done and the operation was abandoned. 
 
 The property lay idle until 1980 when Keradamex Inc. and E B Exploration formed a joint venture to explore the property. The venture conducted soil and rock chip geochemical surveys, limited underground sampling and drilled seven angle core holes (one was abandoned) into the Main mine workings area. This drilling revealed the presence of fracture related gold mineralization up to 36 meters thick extending into the hanging wall of the vein structure. In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. and Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing.

In 1982 Minerva Exploration optioned the property and initiated an underground sampling program. In 1983 a joint venture was formed with Geomex Canada Resources Ltd. Derry, Michener, and Booth were commissioned to assess the property and conducted underground sampling, bulk sampling and metallurgical testing. 
 
 In early 1984 Naneco Resources Ltd., an Alberta company, acquired all of the assets of Minerva and an additional 10 percent interest in the property from Geomex. As operator, Naneco immediately initiated drilling. In 1985, with over 200 RC holes drilled the venture announced encouraging results with anomalous grades of gold and silver throughout its drilling samples. 
 
 During the next few years Naneco increased its interest from 53 percent to 100 percent, conducted additional metallurgy, economic evaluation and drilling. At least 492 RC holes were drilled, most within the Main resource area. Unable to raise money because of falling gold prices and strapped with high land payments to the claim owners, Naneco relinquished the property in 1998. MinQuest acquired it shortly thereafter. The Cyprus target, which was evaluated by Cyprus Minerals Company in 1987 was acquired by MinQuest in early 2002. 
 
 The property was optioned to Rare Earth Metals Corp. (REM) in May of 2002. REM later changed its name to Harvest Gold. Mapping and geochemical sampling of the 7 targets shown on the attached map was completed in October 2002. From 2003 through 2005 REM drilled 30 holes into Main totaling 3,350 meters. The drill holes were angled toward the intersection of the two primary sheeted vein sets. Results showed a 20 improvement in average grade over vertical drilling. 
 
 Following the split of REM into Harvest Gold and VMS Ventures, Inc. Harvest performed no further work at Longstreet after late 2005. The property was finally returned to MinQuest in August 2009. By agreement with Minquest, on January 15, 2010 Star Gold Corp. received an option to acquire the portions of the property covered by the option. 
 
 Star Gold began drilling in the fall of 2011. A 16-hole program at Main showed new intercepts at depth in the central portion of the deposit. Intercept thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent values are 65 to 120 feet. Of the 16 holes drilled 8 have +100 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent and 4 have +200 feet thicknesses of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent. Drill hole LS-1101 has 305 feet of +0.01 oz./ton gold equivalent. Gold equivalent values were derived from the following formula: AuEq oz./ton = Au oz./ton + (Ag oz./ton)/60. Drilling results are shown in the table below. 
 
 Drill samples were sent through a rotating, wet sample splitter attached to the drill to reduce the sample volume and maintain a representative sample. Drill helpers, under the supervision of the project geologist, collected and bagged an A and B sample on 5-foot intervals. Procedurally, an A sample is collected and held by the project geologist for security purposes until it can be delivered to an assay facility. The B sample then remains on site as a duplicate or backup sample if needed at a later date. A blank and two known standard pulps are then submitted randomly spaced with each drill hole. Once assays are available, they are examined for unexpected high or low values. If unexpected high or low values are encountered, the B splits may be collected and submitted, or the lab may be requested to re-assay the pulp or reject in question. The check samples and standard are examined to insure they agree with the original or know within accepted limits, usually +/- 10 . 
 
 ALS Chemex of Reno, Nevada did all sample preparation, including crushing, grinding and preparation of the assay pulps. The samples were never left unattended or unsecured by project geologist, drilling or laboratory staff nor are they handled by officers, directors or associates of Star Gold. 
 
 Sample preparation involves crushing the entire sample to -10 mesh, splitting, then pulverizing 1,000 grams to 75 passing 75-micron mesh. These pulps are then transferred within the ALS Chemex facility for assay. Both gold and silver assays are done by fire assay with an AA finish. The standard Star Gold-Longstreet submittal to ALS Chemex requests a 30-gram charge for gold fire assay. Assays which exceed 10 g/ton are automatically subjected to a gravimetric finish. Select sample intervals, usually those near intervals assaying significant gold, are chosen by the project geologist for re-assay also. 
 
 The Longstreet Project is affiliated with a paleo-hot springs system in a caldera associated volcanic setting very similar to the Round Mountain mine. Round Mountain is an open pit, heap-leach mine that has produced over 10 million ounces of gold over a 30-year period with the average grade currently being mined of 0.018 oz./ton gold. Cut-off grades for Round Mountain and several other oxide ore heap leach operations in Nevada range from 0.003 to 0.005 oz./ton gold. Star Gold hopes to develop an open pit, bulk minable, heap leachable gold/silver mine at Longstreet. 
 
 No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet s proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any such historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics.

Regional Geology and Mineralization: The Longstreet Property is located in the Nevada portion of the Basin and Range Province. This geological province is characterized by repeated episodes of compressional deformation in Paleozoic and Mesozoic time followed by extensional deformation and extensive magmatism and volcanism in Cenozoic time. Gold deposits are most often described as being associated with mineralization trends that reflect deep crustal structures and magmatism, such as the Walker Lane and the Carlin Trend . The Longstreet Project is in the Monitor Range, adjacent to the northwest trending Walker Lane volcanic-hosted gold trend that includes such world-class deposits as the Comstock and Goldfields mining camps.

The Monitor Range is a westward-tilted fault block that has been elevated by normal faults along its eastern front and is typical of the uplifted mountains of the Basin and Range Province. The ranges are topographic highs rising above alluvium-filled valleys generated by Tertiary extensional tectonics. Central Nevada was an area of intense Oligocene Miocene ash-flow volcanism that created numerous calderas and their outflow products. At least 13 calderas that range in age between 32 and 22 Ma have been mapped or interpreted in the area extending from the Shoshone Mountains eastward to the Monitor Range. The southern Monitor Range consists Mainly of Tertiary age volcanic and hypabyssal rocks related to the eruption of the Big Ten Peak volcano and a nearby unnamed 29 Ma caldera (Kleinhampl and Ziony, 1985) intruding and overlying Paleozoic sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. 
 
 The Paleozoic rocks are thrust-faulted marine sedimentary rocks comprised of quartzite, argillite and limestone of Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian age. Minor amounts of Permian marine sediments are also present in the Georges Canyon area. 
 
 In the southern Monitor Range Tertiary age volcanic rocks comprise more than 90 of the exposed bedrock. These rocks are more than 1 km thick and are predominantly flat lying. Early Oligocene to early Miocene rhyolitic to dacitic ash-flow tuffs, with rhyolitic welded tuff are the thickest and most extensive units. Most of the Tertiary intrusions in the region are rhyolitic, but several small dacitic to andesitic dikes are present in the Georges Canyon area. 
 
 Mineral deposits in this part of the Basin and Range Province are varied and widespread and some of them have (had) substantial metal production. The producing Round Mountain gold deposit is about 25 miles northwest, and the past-producing Manhattan Mining Camp (gold/silver) is about 20 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Property. 
 
 The Round Mountain Mine is a giant among epithermal precious metal deposits hosted by volcanic rocks, and the mineralization is a classic example of low sulphidation epithermal gold mineralization (White and Hedenquist, 1995). Gold deposits were discovered at Round Mountain in 1906 (Shawe, 1982) and by 1959 about 410 thousand ounces (troy ounces) of gold had been produced from placer and narrow vein lode deposits. Current production by open-pit mining methods commenced in 1977. Kinross (2010) reported an annual production for 2010 at 184,554 ounces of AuEq, with over 66 million tons of proven and probable reserves. 
 
 The oxidized ore is described as a closely spaced set of steeply dipping veins and veinlets following northwest-trending faults and associated joints over broad areas. Significant gold mineralization is not found in northeast-trending faults and fractures. The vein/veinlet system contains quartz, adularia, limonite (oxidized from pyrite), manganese oxide and associated native free gold. Flat veins are similar to the steep veins in character and mineral content, but with more brecciation of the wall rocks. Gold contents also appear to be higher in the flat veins. The adularia in the ore related veins is dated at 25.9 to 26.6 Ma, which is indistinguishable from the age of the enclosing Tuffs of Round Mountain welded ash flow tuffs. These tuffs were erupted from the Round Mountain caldera and were deposited within the caldera (Henry, Castor and Elson, 1996). 
 
 No party reading this report should conclude the Longstreet Property has economic mineralization due to Longstreet s proximity to any historic or producing mines and any information regarding any such historic or producing mines is strictly informational relative to location and similar geologic characteristics. 
 
 Hydrothermal alteration associated with the bulk mineable ore is evidenced by silicification and the replacement of magmatic feldspar by hydrothermal feldspar engendered by a potassium-rich hydrothermal fluid (Sander, 1988).

The Manhattan gold / silver camp is located approximately 20 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Project and is an example of Tertiary epithermal mineralization superimposed on Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Gold / silver deposits were discovered at Manhattan in 1905 (Shawe, 1982) and by 1959 about 10,500 kg of gold and 4,400 kg of silver had been produced from placer and lode deposits. The lode deposits in the Manhattan district are of a variety of types, although they occur together in a coherent belt about 1 km wide, which follows the south side of the Manhattan caldera for about 10 km. The most productive deposits formed in strongly faulted argillite and quartzite of the Cambrian age Gold Hill Formation. The generally north-trending zones of mineralized fractures are stockworks containing quartz, adularia, pyrite (oxidized to limonite) and native gold similar to the sheeted zones at Round Mountain. The silver production recorded for this camp is related to electrum and various silver-bearing sulphosalts. 
 
 The Clipper Mine located approximately 5 miles southwest of the Longstreet Mine near Murphy Camp was discovered in 1903 and was worked intermittently until 1943. The mine was initially developed during World War I and included a 175-foot shaft and a 370-foot adit. Recorded production is about 12,000 (in 1951 dollars) from mineralization having a gold to silver ratio of 1:1 and assaying from 34-124 per ton (1951 dollars). Host rocks are welded rhyolite ash-flow tuffs similar to the Longstreet mine. The Little Joe Claim located 6 miles south-southwest of the Longstreet Mine was developed by a 75-foot inclined shaft. Gold-bearing veins in rhyolitic tuff were mined but production details are lacking. 
 
 At an un-named mine, located 1.5 miles west of the mouth of Georges Canyon irregular gold / silver quartz veins and veinlets containing minor pyrite were exploited from a 25-foot inclined shaft. The vein system occurs in possible Paleozoic light gray chert and silicified argillite along a fault. No production details are available. 
 
 Mineralization on the Last Chance claims located 11 miles west-northwest of the Longstreet Project and southwest of Big Ten Peak was discovered in the 1920s. Mineralization consists of argentiferous galena, minor sphalerite and pyrite occurring in irregular pipes and chimneys generally at the intersection of cross faults within a northwest-trending shear zone in pre-Tertiary rocks. This property was developed by a 30 m two compartment shaft and a 61 m adit. Production in the late 1920s is recorded as 13.6 tons containing an average of 720 g/t Ag, 21 Pb and 2 Zn. A further 18.1 tons produced in 1938 contained 240-275 g/t Ag and 8 Pb. 
 
 Metallurgy: 2013 Metallurgical Test Program 
 
 The 2013 metallurgical test work program was conducted by McLelland Laboratories under the direction of a QP metallurgical engineer contracted by Star Gold. The program included bottle roll tests, column tests and comminution tests and mineralogical examination. 
 
 Section Sample Assays 
 
 A total of 65 underground adit samples weighing 816 pounds (370kg) and three surface samples weighing 904 pounds (410kg) were collected for metallurgical testing. Each of these samples were crushed to 100 -2 inches (50mm) and assayed for gold and silver in duplicate. Samples were combined to generate surface and underground composites, as well as a blended master composite. Triplicate direct assays were conducted on each composite. Standard deviations between triplicate head assays were high, particularly for the surface master composite. The agreement between the triplicate splits was not good, however the average of the triplicate assays is close to what was expected, based on the section assays. It was noted that the quality control samples all checked out as well, which indicates that the assays are good and the gold occurrence in the potentially economic mineralization is just a little spotty .

A total of twenty pieces of rock from both underground and surface were selected for comminution testing. The remainder of the samples were separately stage crushed to 100 -2-inches (-50mm). Each of the underground and surface samples were then blended to form a master composite representing both the underground and surface samples. The blended sample was then split to generate a third master composite. Samples were collected for bottle roll tests. All composites were then further crushed to 80 -3/4 inch (19mm), blended, then split into 75kg lots for column testing.

Bottle Roll Testing 
 
 A bottle roll test was conducted on each of the three composites at an 80 -10 Mesh (1.7mm) feed size to determine lime requirements for column leach testing. Gold and silver recoveries were similar for all three composites. Gold recoveries ranged from 80.6 to 81.9 and silver recoveries ranged from 17.5 to 20.0 . 
 
 Additional bottle roll tests, at a cyanide concentration of 1.0g NaCN/L were conducted on the blended master composite at feed sizes of 100 -2 inches (50mm), 80 -3/4 inches (19mm) and 80 -1/4 inch (6.3mm) to determine sensitivity to feed size. The blended master composite showed a moderate sensitivity to feed size with respect to gold and silver recovery. Recovery was 18.4 higher for gold, and 13.9 higher for silver, at a feed size of 80 -1/16 inches (1.7mm) than at a feed size of 100 -2 inches (50mm). 
 
 Silver recovery, for each bottle roll test conducted, was low. In order to investigate the cause of the low silver recovery, three additional bottle roll tests were conducted on the blended master composite to determine response to increased cyanide concentration (5.0g NaCN/L) at typical heap leach (80 -3/4 inches, 80 -1/4 inches) and milled (80 -200 Mesh (75 m)) feed sizes. 
 
 Results showed that increasing the cyanide concentration did not significantly increase silver recovery at heap leach feed sizes, however, silver recovery increased substantially when feed was finely ground. Silver recovery was 60.6 from the bottle roll test conducted on 80 -200 mesh material. Gold recovery was also moderately higher when fine grinding was employed. Mineralogical analysis of head and tail samples of the blended master composite confirm that the primary reason for low silver recovery is due to the very fine-grained nature of the silver sulfide, which when exposed, is readily leachable. The silver leach rate at 200 mesh was extremely fast. Silver recovery was complete within the first two hours, which suggests that the silver mineralization is very fast leaching once liberated. In contrast, silver-bearing jarosites tend to be refractory and are usually unaffected by leaching regardless of the grind size.

Both gold and silver recoveries are slightly improved with increased crush size, the increase in recovery is more pronounced in the silver as compared to gold when a fine grind is applied. It is important to keep in mind that in order to reduce the particle size to 80 passing 75 microns a conventional comminution circuit employing crushing and grinding would be required.

Column Leach Testing 
 
 Column leach test were conducted on each of the master composites, utilizing a feed size of 80 -3/4 inch (19 mm) in order to determine gold and silver recoveries, recovery rates and reagent requirements under simulated heap leach conditions. Lime additions were based on bottle roll tests. Test columns were sized at 15 cm diameter by 3 meters high using PVC piping with material stacked in the leaching columns in a manner in which to minimize particle segregation and compaction. Leaching was conducted by applying a cyanide solution of 1.0g NACN/L over the charge at a feed rate of 12 Lph/m 2 of column cross sectional area. After leaching, freshwater rinsing was conducted to remove residual cyanide and to recover dissolved gold and silver values. 
 
 Detail column leach tests data, including screen analysis of the feed and tails and drain down rates can be found in the Appendix, identified as McLelland Report No. 3829 titled Heap Leach Cyanidation Testing Longstreet Project , dated April 6, 2014. 
 
 All three composites were leached for 190 days. Gold and silver extractions for the surface master composite (SMC) reached 88.9 and 20.0 , respectively. Gold and silver extraction for the underground master composites (UMC) was 84.6 for gold and 15.4 for silver. The master blend composite (MBC) achieved gold and silver recoveries of 86.3 and 16.7 respectively.

Recovery results by size fraction for all three master composites indicates that finer crushing would not substantially improve gold recovery. Gold recovery was similar throughout the various size fractions with only a slightly elevated recovery in the finest size fraction (-75 microns). Silver recovery on the other hand would benefit from a finer particle size and would require fine grinding in order to maximize recovery.

Overall metallurgical results indicate that the Longstreet master composites are readily amenable to simulated heap leach treatment at 80 -19 mm feed size. Gold recoveries for all three composites were similar and ranged from 84.6 to 88.9 in 190 days of leaching and rinsing. Silver recoveries were similar for all three samples, with recoveries ranging from 15.4 to 20.0 . 
 
 It is important to note that although the column tests were conducted over a period of 190 days, gold extraction was essentially completed in the first 30 days of leaching. Silver leach rates, on the other hand, were very slow and it is not expected that they would improve beyond the 190-day cycle. 
 
 Cyanide consumption rates were high and ranged from 1.56 to 1.93 kg NaCN/t of ore. This was due in part to the long leach times. Cyanide consumption rates in a commercial operation are typically much lower. 
 
 Figures 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 diagrammatically illustrate the leach rates and results for gold and silver.

 Property Geology : Geologic mapping by MinQuest since 2002 indicates that the majority of the Longstreet Project is underlain by moderately to poorly welded rhyolite ash-flow tuff Tat containing conspicuous exotic lithic fragments and pumice. The ash-flow tuff unit is buff to gray, and contains

Table of Contents 

The Tat tuff unit displays horizontal bedding and may be in the order of 3,000 feet thick. The ash-flow tuff is intruded by rhyolite porphyry dykes Trp exhibiting various orientations and may represent feeder conduits to now-eroded rhyolitic lithologies higher in the stratigraphy. 
 
 A thin discontinuous unit of volcaniclastic and siliceous sediments Ts ), including sinter is deposited upon the ash-flow tuff unit. The unit is white, yellowish and light gray, bedded in part and probably represents a hiatus in volcanism. Siliceous alteration resulting in the development of sheeted quartz vein systems affects the Tat, Ts and Trp rock units. 
 
 Overlying the Tat tuff and the Ts sediments is a black to brown strongly welded ash-flow tuff Trt that forms bluffs and caps ridges. This unit has a distinctive thin (about 10 feet) vitrophyre zone near its base. This unit is estimated to be 300 to 450 feet thick and possibly a correlative of the Saulsbury Wash Formation (21.6 +/- 0.6 Ma). 
 
 The tectonic fabric on the Longstreet Project includes two Main directions of faulting/fracturing that have an influence on the mineralization. An east-trending steeply north-dipping system of fractures and faults has been noted at five of the seven gold / silver zones on the Property (see Figure 6). Quartz adularia limonite veins / veinlets and rusty fractures following this trend contain gold mineralization. The other important gold / silver-bearing fault/fracture direction is 300-330 with steep north dips and is characterized by sheeted quartz veins / veinlets and rusty fractures . The vein / veinlets also contain adularia and iron oxide minerals derived from the oxidation of sulfide minerals. This mineralized trend occurs at all seven of the gold / silver zones known on the Longstreet Project. Major displacement is not a feature of these structures. 
 
 The Longstreet project is an example of gold / silver mineralization related to east-trending structures. An east-tending fault dipping 40-55 is associated with the highest-grade gold / silver mineralization known to date. The bulk of the gold / silver mineralization in the Longstreet Mine is contained in steeply dipping multiple vein sets in the hanging wall of the fault. 
 
 Liedtke (1984) indicates that similar fault directions are known 4,600 feet south and 2,800 feet north of the Longstreet Project, which may host similar high-grade gold / silver mineralization. 
 
 Targets: A short description of the 7 currently identified drilling targets at Longstreet follows: 
 
 Main - The target consists of intersecting high-angle NW and E-W sheeted vein systems. Completion of an angle drilling program to the southwest perpendicular to the intersection of the two vein sets will continue to produce improved continuity and higher tonnage and grade. Un-drilled extensions of this mineralization are indicated to the southeast and west. 
 
 NE Main : Approximately 450m N-NE of the Main resource there is a poorly exposed, un-drilled target that looks identical to Main. Sampling of surface veins at NE Main reveal anomalous gold values. 
 
 Opal Ridge: This is an erosional remnant of a sinter apron that once covered a much larger area. Extensions of the Main resource are down-dropped approximately 60m with an apparent displacement to the north of less than 10m. E-W and NW high level opal-rich veins are exposed in the lower portion of the apron with anomalous gold values. Although there may be a higher stripping ratio here, more of the deposit may be preserved. 
 
 North: This is a sheeted vein system with identical vein attitudes to Main. Values up to 18.1 ppm Au indicate a strong system, although vein density appears to be less than at Main. The western end of the target has the strongest exposed mineralization. 
 
 Cyprus Ridge Zone: Quartz veins up to 5 m thick occur in this 1.1 km long northwest trending sheeted vein system. Cyprus Minerals Company completed a 920 m drill program in 1987. All of the Cyprus holes were vertical or high angle and none tested the large primary vein set. No high-grade gold was intersected in their drilling. MinQuest mapped the intricate vein system in 2002 and collected 41 surface samples that contained anomalous to highly anomalous (several times background to hundreds of times background) veins. Due to the abundance of low temperature silica, MinQuest concluded that the gold values are leakage anomalies from a deeper boiling zone. The boiling zone is a high priority drill target. 
 
 Red Knob Zone : Mineralization outcrops as northwest trending sheeted quartz-adularia veins over an area 150m wide by 300m long. Surface sampling found anomalous gold values. In addition, a boulder field on the north side of the target contains quartz-adularia veins up to 1m in thickness in an area of no outcrop. Drill intercepts from two holes testing a small portion of the target revealed anomalous gold values. 
 
 Spire : This is an E-W vertical to steeply north dipping sheeted vein system. Intersecting NW trending veins are present but are much less abundant than at Main. Surface sampling at Spire had detected anomalous gold values.

Star Gold s geologists believe sampling and drilling results to date warrant optimism of one or more economic, near surface, bulk-mineable, heap leach-recoverable gold-silver deposits at the Longstreet Project targets described above. In addition, sampling at surface near the Cyprus target suggests the presence of higher-grade veins, which may be suitable to underground mining methods. Situated on a high ridge-top, it could be easily mined from a canyon elevation adit. 
 
 Environmental, plan of operation and reclamation: To the Company s knowledge, there is no known surface disturbance or groundwater contamination from previous mining activities. Remediation activities are performed immediately after completion of exploratory drilling. With respect to historical mining activities, there is no indication of reclamation at this time and, therefore, the Company has no plans to remediate. The Longstreet Property is within Forest Service lands and Star Gold has applied for and received a Plan of Operation from the Forest Service allowing exploration drilling. A surface disturbance bond of 89,400 has been paid and is held by the Forest Service until reclamation is completed. There are no other significant environmental requirements.

Dividends 
 
 The Company has not declared any dividends on its common stock since inception. There are no dividend restrictions that limit the Company s ability to pay dividends on common stock in its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. The Corporation s governing statute, Chapter 78 Private Corporations of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the NRS ), does provide limitations on our ability to declare dividends. Section 78.288 of Chapter 78 of the NRS prohibits us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: 

a) 
 the Company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 

b) 
 the Company s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders who may have preferential rights and whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution (except as otherwise specifically allowed by the Company s Articles of Incorporation). 

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Stock Option Plan 
 
 On May 25, 2011, the Board of Directors approved its 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan (the 2011 Plan ). The 2011 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and provides for the grant of stock options to eligible individuals including directors, executive officers and advisors that that have furnished bona fide services to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. 
 
 The 2011 Plan has a maximum percentage of 10 of the Company s outstanding shares that are eligible for the plan pool whereby the number of shares under the 2011 Plan increase automatically with increases in the total number of outstanding common shares. This Evergreen provision permits the reloading of shares that make up the available pool for the 2011 Plan, once the options granted have been exercised. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase, including those shares issued upon exercise of options granted under the 2011 Plan, which become re-available for grant subsequent to exercise of option grants. The number of shares subject to the 2011 Plan and any outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan will be adjusted appropriately by the Board of Directors if the Company s common stock is affected through a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification, dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends) or other distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of substantially all the Company s assets. 
 
 The 2011 Plan also has terms and limitations including without limitation that the exercise price for stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan must equal the stock s fair market value, based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option is granted.

ITEM 7. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

PLAN OF OPERATION 
 
 The Company maintains a corporate office in Coeur d Alene, Idaho. This is the primary administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief Financial Officer Kelly Stopher. 
 
 The drilling permit granted from the Bureau of Land Management BLM in September 2019 expired in December 2022. The permit allowed the Company to commence drilling mainly for the Hydrology Study but also enabling drilling of other holes on the Main knob for geochemical analysis. A bond has been obtained and there are no impediments to drilling other than capital constraints. The Company will apply for an extension of the permit. 
 
 For the fiscal year ending April 30, 2024, the Company plans to commence the following activities as it prepares to draft its Environmental Impact Statement EIS on the Longstreet Project: 
 
 Hydrology Drilling 2 to 4 holes expected to be sufficient: 
 
 Geochemical analysis design of program for submission to State of Nevada involves some core drilling; 
 
 Plan of Operations Development (Mine Plan, Civil Engineering Design) 
 
 Assuming the results of the above-referenced activities are favorable, the Company intends to proceed to the preparation of an EIS and plan of operation for the Longstreet project (the Longstreet Plan ). The eventual objective of the EIS and Longstreet Plan is the issuance, by each respective governing agency, of the necessary mine permits to authorize the construction of, and ongoing operations at, an open pit/heap leach mine at the Longstreet Property. 
 
 Approval of the Longstreet Plan is subject to governmental agency review and may require additional remediation activities. 
 
 Management believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years. The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, sale of property, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties. 
 
 Future liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress of the Company s exploration efforts. The Company will consider additional public offerings, private placement, mergers or debt instruments. 
 
 Additional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for a final permit. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions or be forced to cease operations. Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.

As of April 30, 2023, the Company had cash on hand of 33,505. Since inception, the sole source of financing has been sales of the Company s debt and equity securities. Star Gold Corp. has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing. 
 
 Star Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities to continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of common stock may result in dilution to the Company s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities. 
 
 The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, or ultimately to attain profitability. Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company s capital stock or alternative methods such as mergers or sale of the Company s assets. No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash. The Company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements. 
 
 The Company plans for the long-term continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our equity and/or debt securities and the anticipated profitable exploitation of the Company s mining properties. These plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for equity in the property.

 The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to its stockholders. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The Company has identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are most important to the portrayal of its current financial condition and results of operations. The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the audited financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
 
 Asset Impairments 
 
 The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable. The Company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted net future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value. 
 
 Mineral Interests 
 
 Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mineral properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred. Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the units-of-production method based on periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mineral interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.

 To the shareholders and the board of directors of Star Gold Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Star Gold Corp. the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 The Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has limited working capital and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. 

For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 there were no disagreements with our auditors on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no reportable events as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due primarily to a material weakness in the segregation of duties in the Company s internal control of financial reporting as discussed below. 
 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
 
 Management conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, based on the criteria in a framework developed by the Company s management pursuant to and in compliance with the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, walkthroughs of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of April 30, 2023, because management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the segregation of duties as described below. 
 
 While the Company does adhere to internal controls and processes that were designed and implemented based on the COSO report, it is difficult with a very limited staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to: (i) the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements; (ii) the significance of potential misstatement that could have resulted due to the deficient controls; and (iii) the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, we determined that this control deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected.

 Management has evaluated, and continues to evaluate, avenues for mitigating our internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls to completely mitigate internal control weaknesses have been deemed to be impractical and prohibitively costly, due to the size of our organization at the current time. Management expects to continue to use reasonable care in following and seeking improvements to effective internal control processes that have been and continue to be in use at the Company. 
 
 Management is currently evaluating avenues for mitigating the Company s internal controls weaknesses but mitigating controls that are practical and cost effective may not be found based on the size, structure, and future existence of the organization. Since the Company has not generated any significant revenues, the Company is limited in its options for remediation efforts.

Notes: Based on 97,290,810 shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding as of July 20, 2022, Under Rule 13d-3, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 30, 2023. 

ITEM 13. 
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

iv. 
 Any of the Company s promoters; and 

v. 
 Any relative or spouse of any of the foregoing persons who has the same house as such person. 

Director Independence 
 
 Quotations for the Company s common stock are entered via the OTC Markets inter-dealer quotation system, which does not have director independence requirements. For purposes of determining director independence, we have applied the definitions set out in NASDAQ Rule 4200(a)(15).
