 Forward-looking statements 
 
 Statements made in this Form 10-K that are not historical or current facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 
 Item 1. Description of Business 
 
 General 
 
 Cannabis Suisse Corp. (the Company , we or our is engaged in the rental of commercial office and industrial space. We currently sublease a portion of a commercial building to a third party. We lease the building from a company controlled by our CEO. Since our CEO assumed control of the Company in June 2022, we have no involvement in any aspect of the cannabis industry. 
 
 Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees 
 
 We currently do not have any employees. Our sole officer serves as a consultant to the Company on a part-time basis. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business. 
 
 Limited Operations . Our current business operations consist of subleasing a portion of a building we lease from a company controlled by our CEO. As a result, we currently have limited operations. No assurance can be given that we will have any business operation going forward that sufficiently covers our cost structure. 
 
 Lack of Operating Funds-Going Concern . We do not have a bank account. Our CEO, who is also our sole director, pays our expenses through an escrow account set up for the benefit of the Company. In the event this source of funding ceases before we are able to sustainably increase our business operations there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as an ongoing enterprise. 
 Limited Management . We have no employees. Our CEO also serves as our CFO on a part-time consultant basis. This lack of personnel adversely affects our ability to develop and grow our business. 
 
 Risks Related to our Common Stock 
 
 Voting Control is Held by One Stockholder . Our sole Director and CEO holds a majority of the voting stock of the Company. As a result, he will be able to control the election of directors to our Board of Directors and our business and affairs, including any determination with respect to mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of any assets, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of our common and preferred stock or any other equity securities, the recapitalization, repurchase or redemption of our common stock and the payments of any dividends. 
 
 Penny Stock Considerations Lack of Proprietary Broker-Dealer Quotations . Our shares are penny stocks as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. As a result, the penny stock rules apply. Such rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stocks to persons other than established customers complete certain documentation, make suitable inquires of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure 
 1 
 
 document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers is limited. Because our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities because of the requirements. Because our securities are subject to these rules it will make it more difficult to obtain needed capital in the future. Currently, our securities are not eligible for proprietary broker-dealer quotes. Therefore, our securities have a higher risk of wider spreads, increased price volatility and price dislocation. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be adversely affected with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. Description of Property 
 
 We do not own any property except minimal office furniture. We lease our office from a company controlled by our CEO. In February 2023, the Company leased two real properties, and one of which is for the office and the other to be subleased for rental income. The Company sub-leased a portion of its leased office building for one year from February 2023 to January 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 None.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Background 
 
 In June 2022, the majority stockholder, who served as the Company s CEO sold his stock position to the current CEO and sole director. At such time the Company ceased any and all operations associated with the cannabis industry. The Company then focused its efforts toward real estate operations. In February 2023, we leased a commercial building from a company controlled by our CEO and subleased a portion of the building to a third party. The term of the sublease is one year and the annual rent is 30,000. 
 
 Results of operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, reflect the prior operations of the Company when it was involved in the cannabis business. Consequentially, the financial results of operation for that period have no relevance to the Company current operations. 
 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

 other consulting fees of 128,700 and 35,250 in audit fees; depreciation expense of 4,244 and general and administrative expenses of 60,702. 
 
 The increase in operating expenses is related to the increase of the professional fees due to significance of business activities and SEC filings in the year ended May 31, 2023.

 In its audited financial statements as of May 31, 2023, the Company was issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our only sources for cash at this time are investments by others, and loans from our director. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments

 that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and 
 Stockholders of Cannabis Suisse Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Cannabis Suisse Corp. (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended May 31, 2023, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended May 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company has limited revenues and recurring losses as of May 31, 2023 and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These factors, and the need for additional financing in order for the Company to meet its business plans, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 MAY 31, 2023, and 2022 
 . The net change in valuation allowance for the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 was . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. 
 
 Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. All tax years since inception remains open for examination only by taxing authorities of US Federal and state of Nevada. 
 
 The Company has a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes totaling at May 31, 2023. According to current tax laws, the losses prior to 2018 can carryforward 20 years, and the losses in 2018 or later can carryforward indefinitely. The Company had losses of prior to 2018 which can carryforward through fiscal year 2036. The losses of in years of 2018 and later will carryforward indefinitely. There is a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than a 50 change in ownership).

 Item 9A(T) Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 
 
 1. We do not have an Audit Committee - While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 
 
 2. We did not maintain appropriate cash controls - As of May 31, 2023, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions. 
 
 3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at May 31, 2023, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 
 
 Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 
 
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated 
 17 
 
 to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
