PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Company Overview 

SensaSure is a medical technology
or MedTech company supplying a simple device and method to collect a breath sample for lab-based analysis. Exhaled breath
contains aerosols which originate from the lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for analytics, diagnostics,
and therapeutics. SensaSure s patented method is called ExaBreath (EB) and it can collect, extract, detect and identify non-volatile
compounds present in exhaled breath by utilizing existing lab-based testing infrastructure and procedures. EB is applicable in toxicology,
pharmacology, and clinical biochemistry. Our EB device has not received any approval from a government agency in the European Union nor
from the FDA. We can provide no assurance that any government regulatory body will clear our EB device for commercial use. 

EB may enhance the overall
user experience in a wide range of applications and markets such as workplace drug testing, anti-doping in sport, law enforcement, e-health,
and telemedicine. In the case of anti-doping, EB immediately and substantially reduces the time, cost, and overall burden that drug programs
place on athletes, other participants, and the wider stakeholders such as leagues and associations. EB may significantly improve the
user experience for both donors and collectors during the sample collection process. 

Drug control programs represent
significant market segments due to the necessity of testing in most sports, industries, law enforcement agencies, ministries, police
forces, criminal justice systems and by many employers for the insurance industry. 

We believe that our business
model will follow a methodology to try to reduce risks, transfer the manufacturing costs to third parties to reduce capital investment
which we hope will provide relatively higher margin business based upon our EB collection device, which may improve user acceptability
and analytical credibility in areas such as anti-doping in sport. This may increase the credibility and perceived value of doping control
programs resulting in a stronger deterrence factor and better protection for the integrity of sport. 

The global device
market in drug testing is estimated to be nearly 4.5 billion in 2020 and is estimated to reach 10 billion by 2025 (According to
BCC Research, Drug Testing Market Report 2019). The estimates provided here are based on varying estimates from research companies and
actual numbers may vary significantly. While there are several basic types of drug tests, the most common method is urine testing. 

Current Challenges 

The current challenges facing
the drug testing industry are many and varied. Increasing the overall effectiveness and accuracy of drug control program remains a priority.
However, reducing the burden imposed upon participants in terms of time, cost, inconvenience, and intrusiveness are also important. 

Our intent is to significantly
improve the user experience for donors and collectors during the sample collection process as well as simplify and reduce the costs of
sample preparation, packaging, and transportation to the labs. The EB method may lead to improved overall detection accuracy thus reducing
the incidence of false positives and avoid legal outcomes. 

Our EB device is quick
to use and may provide more predictable sample collection times to enable more samples to be planned and collected. The EB device can
enable new sample collection formats and work patterns (i.e., youth testing, remote collection, and monitoring by video). We believe
our EB device may fulfill the unmet analytical need for a recent cannabis use and impairment test. The EB device provides a solution
platform that is flexible and responsive in a wide range of applications. 

Our Solution 

We are in an omics revolution,
and breathomics is anticipated to offer one of the most significant opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns what we believe may be
a low cost and transformative breath-based technology. EB may have the potential to: 

1. 
 ensure cleaner sports competition 

2. 
 help to make schools, roads,
 and workplaces safer 

3. 
 facilitate the detection
 and diagnosis of diseases earlier

Exhaled breath contains aerosols
which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure
owns the core IP for the design of a collection device as well as the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances
present within these aerosols using a simple electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) is intended to offer
an alternative to blood, urine and oral fluid collection processes in many situations. 

SensaSure s
testing methodology is a non-invasive way to collect chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism.
We believe that SensaSure s core technology will be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace
drug testing and professional sports organizations. 

Our Products and Ongoing Development 

The different
methods of biological sample collection for drug testing are diverse and can be expensive. The data for our device has been collected
by universities and hospitals which provides us with independent research, some of which has been published in journals related to drug
testing. Our EB device has four main characteristics: 

breath offers a new low
 cost and non-invasive sampling methodology. 

breath sampling has been
 found to be an extremely sensitive, back-to-lab based technique, which has been developed into a complete end-to-end analytical platform
 for use in toxicology, pharmacology and clinical biochemistry that can provide improvements to analyses, diagnostics, and therapies. Independent
 studies confirm our approach for a back-to-lab technique. 

EB can detect a wide range
 of exogenous substances, such as drugs of abuse (narcotics), therapeutic drugs (antibiotics) and performance enhancing drugs used
 in sports (stimulants) as well as many other compounds. 

EB can detect a wide range
 of endogenous substances associated with the study of metabolomics and the determination of biomarkers. These may be used to provide
 health monitoring and diagnostics support. This may make EB a useful tool for breathomics and biomarker discovery.

with an additional 20 or
more trials ongoing across a range of application specific areas. So far 80 substances have been detected across 25 categories using
a commercial grade electrostatic filter membrane. A great amount of work and effort has been performed in the field of drug testing and
anti-doping through collaborative partnerships with key industry players. Further work is planned to gather validation data and increase
the IP portfolio. Our area of interest has been expanded to include more projects in the field of biomarker discovery. 

The current distribution of our product is limited to research organizations,
distribution is relatively easy as the product is sent to only a few locations. All transportation of products is done using commercial
courier services. All order processing steps, and associated paperwork is handled internally by the company s accountant and management.
The current production and delivery system functions well, even throughout the disruptions to business caused by COVID-19. 

2 

In the future, when appropriate,
we will develop a larger scale production and delivery system whereby the processes will be outsourced to a 3 rd party
specialist manufacturing partner when required. This partner will source the piece parts, manufacture the product then assemble and package
the kits before storing as inventory or drop shipping as order fulfillment. This will be done in a suitably certified facility with the
relevant ISO or other quality control standards that are applicable to the medtech industry. This partner may also be used to provide
all the logistical operations directly with vendors. This could include all order fulfillment requirements including any eventual volume
supply agreements. There are many suitable partners available in the US and Europe who can provide manufacturing capability as well as
the entire suite of order fulfillment services into the medtech market. 

While we believe that, from
a technological and/or medical perspective, there are no material disadvantages to the use of our product in comparison to other commercially
available alternative products. Our product is relatively new, and we currently have limited commercialization, sales and marketing experience.
Our product will compete against alternative products that are well-established and are widely accepted. Many of our competitors are
large, well-capitalized companies such as Abbott Labs, NMS Labs and LabCorp, with significantly greater market share and resources than
we have. Our success will depend in part on our ability to increase adoption of our product, expand existing relationships with our potential
customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our product, where necessary. We cannot provide any assurance that our EB device
will receive any regulatory approvals to sell the product commercially. 

Why ExaBreath? 

We believe that ExaBreath is Safe - Simple - Effective 

EB testing is suitable for drug testing such as anti-doping
 in sport. 

EB is a quick, easy, and non-intrusive collection process. 

EB is a one-time-use device to prevent cross-contamination. 

EB is potentially less expensive to collect than some
 other matrices. 

Unlike urine, the detection
 window of EB closely mimics that of blood so EB may be a better indication of recent use, which is likely to cause impairment (driving)
 or enhancement (sport). 

Based upon our research,
we believe that the statements we have made above are accurate. It will be up to regulatory agencies such as the FDA that will conduct
an analysis regarding the accuracy of these statements. We believe that our filing with the FDA will not occur for 3-5 years. There is
no assurance that any regulatory body will approve or clear our EB device for use. 

Our Growth Strategy 

Our mission is to provide
a safe, effective, low cost, and easy-to-use device to support and improve outcomes for drug testing. We believe the following strategies
will advance our mission and will contribute to our future success and growth. 

Expand strategic partnership
 engagements to support future production and distribution systems. 

Advance our EB device as
 a common method for collection of samples for drug testing. 

3 

Grow our specialized sales
 force across geographies to foster deeper relationships with partners, third party vendors and drive revenue growth. 

Execute on our business
 model to expand and build an application specific EB device for the collection of samples for different applications and market sectors. 

Leverage our EB Technology
 to develop new products that satisfy significant unmet testing needs such as biomarker discovery. 

Drive profitability by
 scaling our business operations to achieve cost and production efficiencies. 

At the present time any partnership
that we have regarding the study of our device is on a study-by-study basis. We do not have any specific relationships that require
us to perform any of the functions that are being performed by the independent research organization. As we move forward we will
work to develop strategic relationships that will be beneficial to both parties. We provide the number of units requested by the
research organization and bill them for the same. We do not provide any services during clinical or pre-clinical study. 

The Opportunity 

We are in an omics revolution,
and breathomics (exhaled breath) may offer one of the biggest opportunities to healthcare. SensaSure owns a transformative breath-based
technology that can potentially: 

1. 
 detect and diagnose diseases
 earlier, 

2. 
 make roads and workplaces
 safer, and 

3. 
 ensure cleaner sport 

Exhaled breath contains aerosols
which originate from lungs and blood. These aerosols contain revealing information for diagnostics, therapeutics, and analytics. SensaSure
owns the core IP for the design of a collection device and the methodology to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances
present within these aerosols using electret-based filter technology. This technology called ExaBreath (EB) may be able to displace blood,
urine, and oral fluid collection processes in certain situations as a more convenient, reliable, and less costly alternative. 

SensaSure s testing
methodology is a non-invasive way to measure chemicals in breath, for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. Our
core technology could be a major asset for medical research, healthcare, law enforcement, workplace drug testing and professional sport
organizations. Through our subsidiary there are several patents that we hope will protect our device. The table under Intellectual Property/Patents,
below, provides information regarding our patents. 

Our EB device has not received
any approval from a government agency in the European Union nor from the FDA. We can provide no assurance that any government regulatory
body will clear our EB device for commercial use. 

Intellectual property 

Our
success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property
rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid
and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright
and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business.
We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. 

4 

We
seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information
agreements with suppliers, employees, and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary
information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and
proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade
secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. 

As
of April 30, 2023, we own 4 issued U.S. patents with 2 currently being published and 105 issued foreign patents, relating to our current
EB technology. 

The
term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including
the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application
in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment,
which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent
or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having
an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications that we have filed or may file in the future will
result in issued patents, and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our
current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.

Competition 

The
medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and
other market activities of industry participants. We compete or plan to compete with manufacturers and distributors of biologic chemical
testing medical devices. Our most notable competitors in the highly competitive field include Draeger, Respiratory Research Inc., Hound
Labs and Cannabix Technologies Inc. Some competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and
resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives
than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of
our competitors have: 

significantly greater name
 recognition;

Management
considers the competition for SensaSure s EB technique to consist of two main components. The first originates from the existing
base of established biological specimen collection procedures. This includes sample collection types such as blood, urine, oral fluid,
hair, etc. In certain applications some of these methods have been established for many decades and each offers certain advantages and
disadvantages depending on the specific requirements needed. There is a vast number of companies who supply the collection kits for these
matrices and many labs who have the procedures and assays to analyze multiple specimen types. Since the EB method is a back-to-lab type
test, SensaSure will rely upon this existing lab infrastructure for breath testing analysis in areas such as in forensic toxicology,
pharmacology (pharmacokinetics), and clinical biochemistry. We know this is a practical consideration since the EB method has been evaluated
is multiple labs worldwide with data published in peer reviewed technical papers. SensaSure may engage with manufacturing partners who
also produce collection kits for other matrices. 

The
second type of competition consists of suppliers offering other breath sample collection procedures and kits. Some of these are new breathalyzer 
type instruments for detection of drugs such as cannabis in exhaled breath. These are screening devices. Results from lab-based analysis
are considered confirmatory. Other types of devices are for capturing biomarkers in breath and are primarily aimed at the collection
of volatiles. Some of these devices are active, complicated, bulky, and costly. Also, there is limited data to support the effectiveness,
applicability, and reproducibility of these newer method types and equipment. SensaSure s method was designed to overcome all these
shortcomings. Data that supports this has been published by independent labs. None of the research, studies, and field trials that supports
this published data was funded by SensaSure. 

Studies and Clinical Trials 

The first method procedures
for EB were published in March 2015 by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm to detect multiple drugs of abuse. The EB device has been
used extensively for workplace drug testing in Sweden. 

There are multiple projects
running across a range of application specific studies in areas such as law enforcement (cannabis breathalyzers), workplace drug testing,
therapeutics, infectious disease testing, and sport anti-doping. Collaborative partnerships have been established in key areas and additional
published data from ongoing studies and pilots is expected. 

In early 2016, doping control
in sport was identified as a sweet spot for EB and prioritized as the target market. EB provides the anti-doping community
with significant scientific, performance and logistical benefits at all stages of the process. EB offers athletes and doping control
officers a quick, simple, hygienic, and non-intrusive collection procedure. It gives analytical labs and sports governing authorities
the opportunity to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their anti-doping programs as well as reduce overall administrative and
logistical support costs. 

Also in 2016, as part of
a global investment initiative in anti-doping research, the Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC) (www.cleancompetition.org/about/),
funded a pilot study to assess the suitability and applicability of EB as an alternative bio matrix in anti-doping. This lab study was
undertaken at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited lab in Cologne (Germany) by Dr Mario Thevis and his team. Dr Thevis is recognized
as a leading world expert in the field of doping control. The Institute of Biochemistry of the German Sport University Cologne is one
of the most established doping laboratories in the world. The study s results were positive, and the proof-of-concept data was
published in May 2017. 

11 

During 2017, the PCC funded
a second larger follow-on EB lab study, also performed by Dr Thevis. This study focused on substances prohibited for in-competition testing;
it too was successful. The study s data was presented to lab directors at the 36th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne,
April 2018). Further PCC funded labs studies are ongoing. 

Based on the positive method
characterization and validation data from both of Dr Thevis studies, together with data from multiple other non-sport studies/trials
performed over the last eight years by various research institutes such as the Karolinska in Sweden and the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) in Baltimore, the decision was made to proceed with an EB field study in sport. 

The PCC initiated an IRB-approved
field trial and user survey for in-competition testing of athletes to establish ease-of-use and athlete acceptance. A new anti-doping
specific EB sample collection kit was designed, developed, and produced in quantity to support the field trial. This new device/kit was
funded by the PCC. 

The trial was undertaken
by existing MLB partners. CDT doping control services based in Los Angeles, collected samples from 521 MiLB players across several US
teams. SMRTL, a WADA-accredited lab in Salt Lake City, analyzed the samples (across 3 matrices). The trial s data was presented
to lab directors at the 37th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne, Feb. 2019). This field trial was funded by the PCC.

Government Regulation 

United States 

Our
products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FD C
Act and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable
authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design
and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance
or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable
requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters,
import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 

FDA s
Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements 

Each
medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt,
or a pre-market approval from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance,
the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified
into one of three classes Class I, Class II or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each
medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are
deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD C Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding;
registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices.
Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FD C Act, and therefore
may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls
and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post
market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification
requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such
as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k)
device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device
after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices,
the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in orders to commercially distribute these devices.
The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective
manner. 

510(k)
Clearance Pathway 

When
a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially
equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial
distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before
we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence,
the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological
characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the
device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further
information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device,
or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III. 

16 

There
are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special; and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification
needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s
are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the
FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt. We believe that our filing with the FDA will not occur for 3-5
years. 

De
Novo Classification 

Medical
device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless
of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low
to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the Request
for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation, or the de novo classification procedure. 

This
procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical
device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and
approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 FDASIA ),
a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market
notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de
novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without
first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA,
the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer
seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide
a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition
if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low
to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 

Pre-market
Approval Pathway 

A
pre-market approval application must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The pre-market
approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) pre-market notification process. A pre-market approval application
must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling
to demonstrate to the FDA s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 

After
a pre-market approval application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to
permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed pre-market
approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take
up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already
provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide
recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. 

Although
the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel s recommendations are important to the FDA s overall decision-making
process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality
System Regulation QSR ). The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA s regulations. 

Upon
completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information
for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates
the FDA s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments
that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which
are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and
time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or
not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA s review clock is reset. 

17 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical
trials are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States,
for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported
by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing
protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study
sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring,
reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study
protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials
for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review
boards IRBs at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated
to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove
research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval
of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA s IDE regulations
and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed
may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh
the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance
of the product. 

Sponsors
of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information
related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial
is made public as part of the registration. 

Ongoing
Regulation by the FDA 

Even
after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

establishment
 registration and device listing; 

the QSR,
 which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and
 other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

labeling
 regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses,
 and other requirements related to promotional activities; 

medical
 device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to
 a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would
 be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 

corrections
 and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken
 to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD C Act that may present a risk to health; and 

post market
 surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide
 additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

18 

After
a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute
a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer
to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination.
If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance
or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device
until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory
fines and penalties. 

Some
changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission
and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require
the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that
information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions
in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs. 

FDA
regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services CDHS ), requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS
inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related
documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply
with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements
can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions: 

warning
 or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

customer
 notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 

operating
 restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

delay
 in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products; 

withdrawing
 approvals that have already been granted; and 

criminal
 prosecution. 

The
Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware
of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction
that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an
approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations
prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses
may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 

Newly
discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product s labeling, including the addition of new
warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements,
including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA s policies may change, which could delay or prevent
regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development. 

We
would also be subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing
practices. 

19 

European Union 

Our
products are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the European Union Directive (93/42/EEC), also known as the Medical
Device Directive. An authorized third party, Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking. The CE Mark is contingent upon continued
compliance to the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard. 

Other
Regions 

Most
major markets have different levels of regulatory requirements for medical devices. Modifications to the cleared or approved products
may require a new regulatory submission in all major markets. The regulatory requirements, and the review time, vary significantly from
country to country. Products can also be marketed in other countries that have minimal requirements for medical devices. 

Fraud
and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulations 

Federal
and state governmental agencies and equivalent foreign authorities subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including
heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical
device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers
of our products. Federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service
that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally funded healthcare programs. Patient privacy statutes and regulations by
foreign, federal and state governments may also apply in the locations in which we do business. Descriptions of some of the U.S. laws
and regulations that may affect our ability to operate follows. 

Federal
Healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute 

The
federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from
knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash
or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending
the purchase, lease, or order of any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs,
such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value,
and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge
of the law or a specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting
from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims
Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number
of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors
protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, those exceptions and safe harbors
are drawn narrowly, and there is no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities, such as reimbursement support programs,
educational and research grants or charitable donations. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more
applicable statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued.
However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased
scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of
all facts and circumstances. 

20 

Federal Civil
False Claims Act 

The
federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented,
a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record
or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for
purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the federal civil False Claims Act may be brought by the government or
as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as relators 
or, more commonly, as whistleblowers, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.
The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years. Qui tam actions are filed under seal and impose
a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the
Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material
even if the allegations are without merit. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of
these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal
government. Medical device manufacturers and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including,
among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 

Healthcare
Fraud Statute 

The
federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and its implementing regulations created federal criminal
statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare
benefit program, including private third-party payors knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or
making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing
the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment
for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

Sunshine
Act 

The
federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment
is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program to report annually with certain exceptions to
CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the
request of a physician or teaching hospital, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually
to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers
also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. 

Patient
Data Privacy 

HIPAA,
as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH Act ), and their implementing
regulations impose obligations on covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers,
as well as business associates that provide services involving the use or disclosure of personal health information to or on behalf of
covered entities. These obligations, such as mandatory contractual terms, relate to safeguarding the privacy and security of protected
health information. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many
of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. 

Other
State Laws 

Certain
states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices
and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. 

State
and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the
U.S. Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 BBA increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal healthcare laws, including the Anti-Kickback
Statute. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies
recently have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and
other patient support programs, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the Anti-Kickback Statute, federal
civil False Claims Act and violations of healthcare fraud and HIPAA privacy provisions. 

21 

Enforcement and
Penalties for Noncompliance with Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations 

Compliance
with these federal and state laws and regulations requires substantial resources. If our operations are found to be in violation of any
of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal
and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs
such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the
curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Companies settling federal civil False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute and other fraud
and abuse cases also may be required to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Office of Inspector General in order to avoid exclusion from participation (i.e., loss of coverage for their products) in federal healthcare
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Corporate Integrity Agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. 

For
additional information regarding obligations under federal healthcare statues and regulations, please see the section titled Risk
Factors If we fail to comply with U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including those relating to kickbacks
and false claims for reimbursement, we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected. 

United
States Healthcare Reform 

There
have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or
manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. 

For
example, in the United States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA ), was enacted. The ACA contains a number of significant provisions, including
those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact
existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA, among other things, imposes an excise
tax of 2.3 on the sale of most medical devices. 

In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control
Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year,
which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain
in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased
the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

Further,
recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products,
which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed, and enacted federal and state legislation designed to bring
transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Congress and the Trump
administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control product costs.
Additionally, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products
to purchase, and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. 

Human Capital Resources 

As of April 30, 2023, we had
1 employee, our CEO and Chairman Clarence Chan. Our employee is not represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never
experienced difficulties with our employee. We believe our employee relations are good. 

Facilities 

We do not produce our EB devices testing samples. We rely upon specialist
manufacturing partners. Our first-generation devices testing samples were made for Sensabues AB by a manufacturer in Sweden. These first-generation
devices are our reference design for evaluation purposes and to support small quantity sample devices sales activities. 

22 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the current operational management of the company are all home-office based primarily in the UK and Sweden. Considering the current capability
and trend toward working from home, the management sees the need to continue offering flexible home-office based working arrangements
for existing as well as any new employees. New employees will likely be added in the USA to provide local support for commercialization
plans in the target market sectors and will be home office based to ensure optimal flexibility and resilience for ongoing operations. 

Our second-generation
device testing samples is similar to the first-generation device but with additional features and functionality incorporated into
the design at the request of our sports anti-doping partners. These application specific units, used in a large field trial for
sport by Major League Baseball, were designed and manufactured in the USA. 

Manufacturing of the 2nd gen
EB device can be re-started if more units are required. This would involve an approximate 8-week lead-time. Alternatively, if a modified
version of the EB device is required, the lead time for this unit would be dependent upon the new specification. 

We anticipate the eventual
outsourcing of manufacturing, storage, and delivery operations to a specialist logistics partner. Such partners can offer a flexible
and scalable operation that can be highly responsive in terms of operational scope and product volumes. 

This partner will source the
piece parts, manufacture the product then assemble and package the kits before storing as inventory or drop shipping as order fulfillment.
This will be a suitable facility in terms of level of expertise, scale, and certification. The relevant ISO or other quality control
standards will be met as applicable to the medtech industry. This partner may also be used to provide all the logistical operations directly
with vendors. This could include all order fulfillment requirements including any eventual volume supply agreements. There are many suitable
partners available in the US and Europe who can provide the manufacturing capability as well as the entire suite of order fulfillment
services into the medtech market. 

Legal Proceedings 

We may be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this filing management has no knowledge of any current or
foreseeable legal proceedings. 

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
and Smaller Reporting Company 

We qualify as an emerging
growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act. As a result,
we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that
are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we have included detailed compensation information for only our three most highly compensated
executive officers and have not included a compensation discussion and analysis, or CD A, of our executive compensation programs
in this report. In addition, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

engage
 an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act
 of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act; 

23 

comply
 with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit
 firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements
 (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 

submit
 certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay, say-on-frequency, 
 and say-on-golden parachutes; or 

disclose
 certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparison
 of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 

In addition, the JOBS Act
provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earliest to occur of: 

our reporting
 1 billion or more in annual gross revenues; 

our issuance,
 in a three-year period, of more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt; 

the end
 of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million on the last business
 day of our second fiscal quarter; and 

December
 31, 2027. 

We cannot predict if investors
will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market
for our securities and increased volatility in the price of our securities. 

Finally, we are a smaller
reporting company (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly
may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements
and only two years of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result,
the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in
which you hold equity interests. 

24 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Investing in our common
stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all the other information contained
in this annual report, including our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. While we believe that
the risks and uncertainties described below are the material risks currently facing us, additional risks that we do not yet know of or
that we currently think are immaterial may also arise and materially affect our business. If any of the following risks materialize,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price
of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all your investment. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Products 

We have a history of net losses, and we
expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. If we ever achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it. 

We have incurred losses since
our inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have reported net losses of 782,953 and 1,047,609
for the year ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result of these losses, as of April 30, 2023, we had a total deficit of
approximately 1,061,593 (2022 - 463,205). At April 30, 2023 we had 26,958 (2022 - 437,177) in cash and restricted cash held in trust,
and an accumulated deficit of 6,027,209 (2022 - 4,433,352). We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research
and development, regulatory and other expenses as we expand our marketing efforts to increase adoption of our products, expand our customer
base, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future products, conduct clinical trials on our existing and planned
or future products and develop new products or add new features to our existing products. In addition, we expect our general and administrative
expenses to increase after we have become a public company due to the additional costs associated with being a public company. The net
losses that we incur may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve
and sustain profitability. Even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period
of time. 

Our EB product is not approved or cleared
by any governmental body for sale or use. 

We currently sell our product
for research purposes only in order to gather method validation data. All studies, trials, and projects are undertaken by 3rd party organizations
who get the necessary ethics/IRB approvals to use the device and perform the research across a wide range of application areas. These
sales are made to a very limited market segment. 

We have not applied to any
governmental agency for approval of our EB device for commercial sale or use. Unless we are able to secure the appropriate approvals
by the various government agencies throughout the world our sales will be very limited, and we will not be able to expand our sales. 

Our success depends on our EB technology
(our ExaBreath Technology). If we are unable to successfully produce, market and sell products incorporating our EB Technology, our business
prospects will be significantly harmed, and we may be unable to achieve revenue growth. 

Our future financial success
will depend substantially on our ability to effectively and profitably produce, market and sell our products incorporating our EB Technology.
The commercial success of our product and any of our planned or future products will depend on a number of factors, including the following: 

the actual
 and perceived effectiveness and reliability of our product, especially relative to alternative products; 

the prevalence
 and severity of any adverse user events involving our products; 

the results
 of usage of our product; 

our ability
 to obtain regulatory approval to market our planned or future products for use in drug testing in the United States; 

the availability,
 relative cost and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative technologies or collection methods by our product; 

the degree
 to which our products are covered and receive adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental and private
 insurers; 

the degree
 to which our product is accepted; 

our ability
 to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights in and to our EB Technology and our products that incorporate
 our EB Technology; 

achieving
 and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our products; 

the extent
 to which we are successful in educating users about EB technology in general, and the benefits of our product; 

the strength
 of our marketing and distribution infrastructure; 

25 

the effectiveness
 of our and our distributors marketing and sales efforts in the United States and abroad, including our efforts to build out
 our sales team; 

the level
 of education and awareness among users concerning our product; 

our reputation
 among third party users of our product; 

our ability
 to continue to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing
 Practices cGMP and Quality Systems Regulations QSR and 

whether
 we are required by the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities to get government approval for the use of our products. 

If we fail to successfully
market and sell our product, we will not be able to achieve profitability, which will have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to grow our revenue in future periods will depend on our ability to successfully
penetrate our target markets and increase sales of our product and any new product or product that we introduce, which will, in turn,
depend in part on our success in growing our user base and driving increased use of our products. New products may also need to be approved
or cleared by the FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies to drive revenue growth. If we cannot achieve revenue growth, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We currently third-party manufacture and
sell a product that is used by a limited number of companies, which could negatively affect our operations and financial condition. 

Currently, our product consists
primarily of our EB device for sample collection by labs and research organizations in the European Union and in the United States. Therefore,
we are dependent on limited market adoption of this product, and we will continue to be dependent on the success of this product for
the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that our product will gain a substantial degree of market acceptance among physicians,
healthcare providers or other third-party users. Our failure to successfully increase sales of this product or any other event impeding
our ability to sell this product would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

For our company to thrive, we must lead
and benefit from a shift in thinking about the role of exhaled breath as a sample collection device in drug detection. 

The use of breath as a testing
methodology for multiple chemical indications is a new concept. A shift in thinking in the method of collection of drug samples for testing
is needed for the successful market acceptance of our product. We will need to educate users of our EB device about the safety, efficacy,
necessity, and efficiency of our product. This will require educating them about the benefits of our technology. We believe that focusing
on exhaled breath is a paradigm shift in the collection of samples because other methods of collection have not specifically focused
on this source for sample collection. The failure of our marketing and executive teams to drive this shift in thinking among doctors,
users, third-party payors, and regulators could adversely affect our ability to grow the business. 

We currently have limited sales or marketing
capabilities. If we are unable to establish effective sales and marketing capabilities or if we are unable to enter into agreements with
third parties to commercialize our product, we may not be able to effectively generate product revenue, sustain revenue growth and compete
effectively. 

We currently have limited
sales or marketing capabilities. Our sales were 4,417 and 6,424 for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Building
the requisite sales, marketing or distribution capabilities will be expensive and time-consuming and will require significant attention
from our leadership team to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing or distribution capabilities would
adversely impact the commercialization of our product. The competition for talented individuals experienced in selling and marketing
medical device products is intense, and we cannot assure you that we can assemble or maintain an effective team. Additionally, we may
choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties on the commercialization of our product.
If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our
products. 

26 

We may expend our limited resources to
pursue a particular product and fail to capitalize on products that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood
of success. 

Because we have limited financial
and managerial resources, we focus on a specific product. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of other opportunities with others
that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial
products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs may not yield any commercially
viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular potential product, we may
relinquish valuable rights to that potential product through future collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements in cases
in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such potential product. 

In the future our product may become obsolete,
which would negatively affect operations and financial condition. 

The medical device industry
is characterized by rapid and significant change. There can be no assurance that other companies will not succeed in developing or marketing
devices and products that are more effective than our ExaBreath (EB) device or that would render our EB device obsolete or noncompetitive.
Additionally, new procedures for sample collection could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of our product. Accordingly,
our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to medical and other changes through the development and introduction
of new products. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that our new product development efforts
will result in any commercially successful products. 

The commercial success of our product will
depend upon attaining significant market acceptance of this product among physicians, healthcare payors and the medical community. 

Our success will depend, in
part, on the acceptance of our product as safe, useful and, with respect to providers, cost effective. We cannot predict how quickly,
if at all, our product will be accepted or, if accepted, how frequently it will be used. Our product and planned or future products we
may develop or market may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians and the medical community for some or all of our targeted
usage. Healthcare providers must believe that our product offers benefits over alternative methods. The degree of market acceptance of
our product will depend on a number of factors, including: 

whether
 physicians and others in the medical community consider our product to be safe and cost effective; 

the potential
 and perceived advantages of our product over alternative sample collection methods; 

the possibility
 of any side effects associated with using our product; 

product
 labeling or product insert requirements by the FDA or other non-US regulatory authorities; 

limitations
 or warnings contained in the labeling cleared or approved by the FDA or other non-US authorities; 

the convenience
 and ease of use of our product relative to alternative sample collection methods; 

pricing
 pressure, including from group purchasing organizations GPOs ), seeking to obtain discounts on our product based on
 the collective buying power of the GPO members; 

the availability
 of coverage and adequate reimbursement for the use of our product from third-party payors, including government authorities; 

the willingness
 of users to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities; 

the effectiveness
 of our sales and marketing efforts for our product 

27 

Even if our product achieves
market acceptance, it may not maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies, which are more cost effective
or received more favorably, are introduced. Failure to achieve or maintain market acceptance and/or market share would limit our ability
to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The size of the market for our current
and future products have not been established with precision and may be smaller than we estimate. 

Our estimates of the annual
total addressable markets for our current product and products under development are based on internal and third-party estimates, including,
without limitation, the number of drug tests administered and the assumed prices at which we can sell our EB device for markets that
have not been established. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and
estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the
predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our current or
future products may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of drug tests that would benefit from our product, the price at which
we can sell our device, or the annual total addressable market for our product is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales
growth and have an adverse impact on our business. 

We have limited commercial manufacturing
experience and may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays in producing our product and planned or future products
that could limit the potential growth of our revenue or increase our losses. 

We have limited experience
in commercially manufacturing our product and no experience manufacturing this product in the volume that we anticipate will be required
if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales. The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components
purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. Our failure to obtain required components or sub-assemblies when needed and at a reasonable
cost would adversely affect our business. As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing
capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture our existing, planned, or future products in significant volumes, while
meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design, and production standards required to market our products
successfully. 

We may encounter unforeseen
situations in the manufacturing and assembly of our product that would result in delays or shortfalls in our production. For example,
our production processes and assembly methods may have to change to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing
capacity, which may increase our manufacturing costs, delay production of our products, reduce our product margin and adversely impact
our business. Conversely, if demand for our products shifts such that a manufacturing facility is operated below its capacity for an
extended period, we may adjust our manufacturing operations to reduce fixed costs, which could lead to uncertainty and delays in manufacturing
times and quality during any transition period. 

If our manufacturing activities
are adversely impacted or if we are otherwise unable to keep up with demand for our products by successfully manufacturing, assembling,
testing, and shipping our products in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our product could be adversely
affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors products, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may be unable to compete successfully
with larger companies in our highly competitive industry. 

There are numerous sample
collection methods. Many of these methods are well-established and are widely accepted by physicians, users, and third-party payors.
Third-party payors may encourage the use of competitors products. In addition, many companies are developing products, and we
cannot predict what the standard of care will be in the future. 

28 

The medical device industry
is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities
of industry participants. We compete or plan to compete with manufacturers and distributors of sample collection devices. Many of our
competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence,
they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with
smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have: 

significantly
 greater name recognition; 

broader
 or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payors; 

more established
 distribution networks; 

additional
 lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive
 advantage; 

greater
 experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or
 approval for products; and 

greater
 financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation. 

We believe that our ExaBreath
device, our focus on drug testing sample collection and our organizational culture and strategy, will be important factors in our future
success. We compete primarily on the basis that our product will be regarded as safe and effective, with improved outcomes and procedural
cost savings. Our continued success depends on our ability to: 

develop
 innovative, proprietary products that can cost-effectively address significant sample collection needs; 

continue
 to innovate and develop scientifically advanced technology; 

obtain
 and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals; 

demonstrate
 efficacy in our sponsored and third-party clinical trials and studies; 

apply
 our technology across product lines and markets; 

attract
 and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and 

cost-effectively
 manufacture and successfully market and sell products. 

In addition, competitors with
greater financial resources than ours could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new
technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products, which may cause our revenue to decline and would
harm our business. 

Our competitors also compete
with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary
to, or necessary for, our products. Because of the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient
number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

29 

Our operating results may fluctuate significantly,
which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any
guidance we may provide. 

Our quarterly and annual
operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations
may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to: 

the level
 of demand for our product which may vary significantly; 

expenditures
 that we may incur to acquire, develop, or commercialize additional products and technologies; 

the timing
 and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for planned or future products or innovations; 

the rate
 at which we grow our sales force and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become effective, and the cost and level of investment
 therein; 

the degree
 of competition in our industry and any change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors
 or future partners; 

coverage
 and reimbursement policies with respect to our products, if approved, and potential future products that compete with our products; 

the timing
 and success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product or any future products we develop or competing products; 

the timing
 of customer orders and the number of available selling days in any quarterly period, which can be impacted by holidays, the mix of
 products sold and the geographic mix of where products are sold; 

seasonality,
 including the seasonal slowing of demand for our product which we may experience in the fourth quarter and summer months based on
 the elective nature of using our product, and which we expect to become more pronounced in the future as our business grows; 

the timing
 and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, regulatory approval, and commercialization activities relating to
 our product, which may change from time to time; 

the cost
 of manufacturing our products, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with third-party
 suppliers and manufacturers; and 

future
 accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies 

The cumulative effects of
these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing
our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an
indication of our future performance. 

This variability and unpredictability
could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue
or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results or operations. 

30 

We will require substantial additional
capital to finance our planned operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain additional
financing when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or eliminate our product development programs,
commercialization efforts or other operations. 

Since inception, we have
incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Since our inception, our operations
have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, indebtedness and, to a lesser extent, product revenue. As
of April 30, 2023, we had 26,958 in cash and restricted cash held in trust, and an accumulated deficit of 6,027,209. At April 30, 2022
we had 437,177 in cash and restricted cash held in trust, and an accumulated deficit of 4,433,352. Based on our current planned operations,
we expect our cash and restricted cash held in trust, will enable us to fund our operating expenses for at least the next 12 months.
We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. 

We intend to continue to
make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization by increasing the number of sales representatives and expanding
our international marketing programs to help facilitate further adoption among hospital accounts as well as broaden awareness of our
product to employers, law enforcement agencies, ministries, police forces and insurance companies. We also expect to continue to make
investments in research and development, regulatory affairs, and clinical studies to develop future generations of our product, support
regulatory submissions and demonstrate the clinical efficacy of our product. Moreover, we expect to incur additional expenses associated
with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing and SEC compliance, investor relations and
other expenses. Because of these and other factors, we expect to continue to incur substantial net losses and negative cash flows from
operations for the foreseeable future. 

Our future capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including: 

the cost,
 timing and results of our clinical trials and regulatory reviews; 

the cost
 and timing of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities; 

the terms
 and timing of any other collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements that we may establish; 

the timing,
 receipt and amount of sales from our product; 

the degree
 of success we experience in commercializing our product; 

the emergence
 of competing or complementary technologies; 

the cost
 of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
 and 

the extent
 to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating
 to any of these types of transactions. 

We will require additional
financing to fund working capital and pay our obligations. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination
of public or private equity offerings and/or debt financings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional
funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms
when needed, we may be required to significantly reduce operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business
and/or results of operations and financial condition. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible
debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation
or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we
may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures, or declaring dividends. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. 

We are highly dependent on our senior management
team and key personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success. 

We are highly dependent on
our senior management and other key personnel. Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and
retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers, and
other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments. The loss of members of our senior
management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists, and engineers could result in delays
in product development and harm our business. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, it would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

31 

Competition for skilled personnel
in our market is intense and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. To induce
valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have issued stock options that vest over time.
The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond
our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Despite our efforts to retain
valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice.
Our employment arrangements with our employees provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our
employment at any time, with or without notice. We also do not maintain key man insurance policies on the lives of these
individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. 

We believe we will need to increase the
size of our workforce in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. If we are unable to manage the anticipated
growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected. 

As of April 30, 2023, we
had 1 full-time employee. As our sales and marketing strategies develop and as we transition into operating as a public company, we expect
to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added
responsibilities on members of management, including: 

identifying,
 recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees; 

managing
 our internal development efforts effectively, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties;
 and 

improving
 our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures 

Our future financial performance
and our ability to successfully market and sell our product will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth,
and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of attention away from day-to-day activities to devote a substantial
amount of time to managing these growth activities. 

We expect to grow our sales
force in anticipation of additional product approvals or clearances and increased entry into new markets. The growth we may experience
in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including
our manufacturing operations. Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our product, which
could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring
new employees, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product and,
accordingly, may not achieve our research, sales, and marketing goals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

If we fail to grow our sales and marketing
capabilities and develop widespread brand awareness cost effectively, our growth will be impeded, and our business may suffer. 

We plan to actively expand
our international field presence through new distributors, additional sales and clinical personnel and we hope to add new U.S. sales
territories. We plan to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure to grow our customer base and our business. Identifying
and recruiting qualified personnel and training them on the use of our product, on applicable federal and state laws and regulations
and on our internal policies and procedures, will require significant time, expense, and attention. It can take significant time before
our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if our efforts to expand and train our sales force
do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel
or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize
the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenue. 

Our ability to increase our
customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our product will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing
operations. We plan to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our marketing programs. Our business would be harmed if
our marketing efforts and expenditures do not generate an increase in revenue. 

32 

In addition, we believe that
developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving broad acceptance of our product
and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue and, even if they do,
any increase in revenue may not offset the costs and expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain,
and protect our brand, we may fail to attract or retain the customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building
efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our technology. 

We intend to expand sales of our product
internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval or in successfully marketing
our product internationally even if approved. A variety of risks associated with marketing our products internationally could materially
adversely affect our business. 

While our limited research
revenue has been in the European Union, our EB product is not cleared in any markets. We intend to increase our sales in the United States.
Sales of our product are and will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. We
will incur substantial expenses in connection with our product sales. Additional risks related to operating in foreign countries include: 

differing
 regulatory requirements in foreign countries; 

differing
 reimbursement regimes in foreign countries, including price controls; 

unexpected
 changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements; 

economic
 weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

compliance
 with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; 

foreign
 taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 

foreign
 currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses, reduced revenue and other obligations incident to doing
 business in another country; 

difficulties
 staffing and managing foreign operations; 

workforce
 uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

potential
 liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA ), or comparable foreign regulations; 

challenges
 enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect
 intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; 

product
 shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material or finished good supply or distribution or manufacturing capabilities
 abroad; and 

business
 interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism. 

These and other risks associated
with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations, which would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

33 

Our product is not approved or cleared by any governmental body
for sale. 

We currently sell our product
for research purposes only in order to gather method validation data. All studies, trials, and projects are undertaken by 3rd party organizations
who get the necessary ethics/IRB approvals to use the device and perform the research across a wide range of application areas. These
sales are made to a very limited market segment. 

Unless we are able to secure
the appropriate approvals by the various government agencies throughout the world our sales will be very limited, and we will not be
able to expand our sales. 

Our future growth may depend, in part,
on our ability to operate in foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties. 

Our future growth may depend,
in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our planned and future products in foreign markets. We are not permitted to market
or promote any of our planned or future products before we receive regulatory approval from applicable regulatory authorities in foreign
markets, and we may never receive such regulatory approvals for any of our planned or future products. To obtain separate regulatory
approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing,
among other things, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing, and distribution of our planned or future products. If we obtain regulatory
approval of our products and ultimately commercialize our planned or future products in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional
risks and uncertainties, including: 

different
 regulatory requirements for approval of medical devices in foreign countries; 

reduced
 protection for intellectual property rights; 

the existence
 of additional third-party patent rights of potential relevance to our business; 

unexpected
 changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; 

economic
 weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

compliance
 with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; 

foreign
 currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses, reduced revenue and other obligations incident to doing
 business in another country; 

foreign
 reimbursement, pricing, and insurance regimes; 

workforce
 uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is common; 

production
 shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and 

business
 interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons,
 floods, and fires. 

We will face additional credit and compliance
risks related to our international sales using foreign distributors. 

We plan to partner with distributors
for our product in select geographies outside of the United States. We may not be able to collect all of the funds owed to us by our
foreign distributors. Some foreign distributors may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which may hinder our collection
of accounts receivable. Where we extend credit terms to distributors, we will periodically review the collectability and creditworthiness
when determining the payment terms for such distributors. If our uncollectible accounts exceed our expectations, this could adversely
impact our operating results. In addition, failure by our foreign distributors to comply with the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act
2010 (the U.K. Bribery Act or similar laws, insurance requirements or other contract terms could have a negative impact
on our business. Failure to manage the risks related to our foreign distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

34 

Governmental export or import controls could limit our ability
to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them. 

Governmental regulation of
the import or export of our product, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our product, when applicable,
could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the
export of our product may create delays in the introduction of our product in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export
of our product to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain
products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations
and such economic sanctions, we may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including a denial of certain export privileges. Moreover,
any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or
in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our product by, or in our decreased
ability to export our product to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our product or limitation
on our ability to export or sell access to our product would likely materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

Technological change may adversely affect
sales of our product and may cause our product to become obsolete. 

The medical device market
is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Technological progress or new developments in
our industry could adversely affect sales of our product. Our product could be rendered obsolete because of future innovations by our
competitors or others in the research of Exabreath technology, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

Consolidation in the medical device industry
could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. 

Many medical device companies
are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the medical device industry consolidates, competition to provide
goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to
negotiate price concessions or reductions for our product. If we reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry,
our revenue will decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If product liability lawsuits are brought
against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit or halt the marketing and sale of our product. The expense
and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for liabilities resulting from our products could harm us and our ability to sell
our product. 

We face an inherent risk
of product liability as a result of the future marketing and sale of our product. For example, we may be sued if our product causes or
are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability
claim may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence,
strict liability, or a breach of warranties. In addition, we may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to
the actions of others or the pre-existing health of the user. For example, we may rely on physicians in connection with the use of our
product on patients. If these physicians are not properly trained or are negligent, the capabilities of our product may be diminished,
or the user may suffer critical injury. We may also be subject to claims that are caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as
those who provide us with components and sub-assemblies. 

If we cannot successfully
defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or halt commercialization
of our product. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual
outcome, liability claims may result in: 

decreased
 demand for our product; 

injury
 to our reputation; 

35 

initiation
 of investigations by regulators; 

costs
 to defend the related litigation; 

a diversion
 of management s time and our resources; 

substantial
 monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 

product
 recalls, withdrawals, or labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions; 

loss of
 revenue; 

exhaustion
 of any available insurance and our capital resources; and 

the inability
 to market and sell our product. 

Insurance coverage is increasingly
expensive. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability
that may arise. The potential inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product
liability claims could prevent or inhibit the marketing and sale of our product. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or
negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations, should we obtain insurance coverage, or that are not covered by our
insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts, which would have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any product liability claims brought against us, with or
without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation
in the industry, significantly increase our expenses and reduce product sales. 

Prospective customers may
also have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operations and use of our product. Medical malpractice
carriers in the U.S. are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens,
customers may discontinue using our product and potential customers may opt against purchasing our product due to the cost or inability
to procure insurance coverage. 

Litigation and other legal proceedings
may adversely affect our business. 

From time to time, we may
become involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims,
tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action and other legal proceedings or investigations, which
could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the
operation of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive
relief that affect how we operate our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or
for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. There may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may
be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings, or investigations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation
and brand image, undermine our customers confidence, and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal
action is unfounded or not material to our operations. 

36 

If we experience significant disruptions in our information
technology systems, our business may be adversely affected. 

We depend on our information
technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including the manufacture, distribution, and maintenance of our product,
as well as for accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. We do not have redundant information technology
systems at this time. Our information technology systems may be subject to computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, attacks by
computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, or components thereof, power outages, damage
or interruption from fires or other natural disasters, hardware failures, telecommunication failures and user errors, among other malfunctions.
We could be subject to an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems, which could disrupt
our operations, corrupt our data, or result in release of our confidential information. We address these data security concerns in more
detail below. Technological interruptions would disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders,
project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers or disrupt our customers 
ability to use our product. In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient
and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Currently, we carry business interruption coverage to mitigate
certain potential losses, but this insurance is limited in amount, and we cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed
our policy limits. We are increasingly dependent on complex information technology to manage our infrastructure. Our information systems
require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance our existing systems. Failure to maintain or
protect our information systems and data integrity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

If we experience security or data privacy
breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data or
personal data, or if customers, patients and other partners are reluctant to use our device because of concerns about the privacy or
security of their data, we may face additional costs, loss of revenue, significant liabilities, harm to our brand, decreased use of our
platform and business disruption. 

In connection with various
facets of our business, we may collect and use a variety of personal data, such as name, mailing address, email addresses, mobile phone
number, location information and clinical trial information. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access
to, use of, or disclosure of our data or consumers personal data could result in significant liability under state (e.g., state
breach notification laws), federal (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA and the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH Act )) and international law (e.g., the European Union s
General Data Protection Regulation GDPR )). Such an incident may also cause a material loss of revenue from the potential
adverse impact to our reputation and brand, affect our ability to retain or attract new users and potentially disrupt our business. We
may also rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of our data and that of users, and any failure by such
third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of such information could have similarly adverse
consequences for us. 

Because the techniques used
to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched
against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
Our servers and platforms may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not
detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures may misappropriate our confidential or proprietary information, disrupt
our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. We may need to expend significant resources and
make significant capital investment to protect against security breaches or to mitigate the impact of any such breaches. If we are unable
to prevent or mitigate the impact of such security breaches, our ability to litigation and governmental investigations, which could lead
to a potential disruption to our business. 

If we fail to identify, acquire, and develop
other products, we may be unable to grow our business. 

As a significant part of
our growth strategy, we intend to develop and commercialize additional products through our research and development program or by licensing
or acquiring additional products and technologies from third parties. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify,
select, and acquire the right to products and technologies on terms that are acceptable to us. 

Any product we identify,
license, or acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval
or clearance by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All products are prone to the risks of failure inherent in medical
device product development, including the possibility that the product will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval
or clearance by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved or cleared will be
manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace. 

Proposing, negotiating, and
implementing an economically viable product or technology acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including
those with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the acquisition or license of approved
or cleared products. We may not be able to acquire or license the rights to additional approved or cleared products on terms that we
find acceptable, or at all. 

If we are unable to develop
suitable potential products through internal research programs or by obtaining rights from third parties, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

37 

We may acquire other businesses which could
require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations. 

As part of our business strategy,
we may in the future make acquisitions or investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies that we believe fit within
our business model and can address the needs of our customers and potential customers. In the future, we may not be able to acquire and
integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates,
and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the pursuit of potential acquisitions
may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur additional expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable
acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position
or achieve our goals, including increases in revenue, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors,
and industry analysts. 

Future acquisitions may reduce
our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired. We
may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our
financial condition or the value of our common stock. The sale or issuance of equity to finance any such acquisitions would result in
dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness to finance any such acquisition would result in fixed obligations and could
also include covenants or other restrictions that could impede our ability to manage our operations. In addition, our future results
of operations may be adversely affected by the dilutive effect of an acquisition, performance earn-outs or contingent bonuses associated
with an acquisition. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large, one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities,
adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expenses and the recording and subsequent amortization of amounts related
to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which items could negatively affect our future results of operations. We may also incur
goodwill impairment charges in the future if we do not realize the expected value of any such acquisitions. 

Economic conditions may adversely affect
our business. 

Adverse worldwide economic
conditions may negatively impact our business. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause
unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections, and additional allowances may be required, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely
impact our suppliers ability to provide us with materials and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

Business disruptions could seriously harm
our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. 

Our operations could be subject
to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions,
medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We
rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product could be disrupted if
the operations of these suppliers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The occurrence of any
of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Risks Related to Government Regulation and Our Industry 

If we fail to comply with U.S. federal
and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to kickbacks and false claims for reimbursement,
we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Healthcare providers and
third-party payors play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation, ordering and purchasing of any medical device for which we
have or obtain marketing clearance or approval. Through our arrangements with principal investigators, healthcare professionals, third-party
payors, and customers, we are exposed to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other healthcare laws
and regulations that may constrain our business, our arrangements and relationships with customers, and how we market, sell, and distribute
our marketed medical device. We have a Code of Conduct and associated policies and procedures, but it is not always possible to identify
and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent noncompliance may not
be effective in protecting us from governmental investigations for failure to comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare
laws and regulations. 

In the United States, we
will be subject to various state and federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback
Statute Anti-Kickback Statute and federal civil False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. Our relationships
and our distributors relationships with physicians, other health care professionals and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under
these laws. 

Healthcare fraud and abuse
laws and related regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition
has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

the Anti-Kickback
 Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying remuneration, directly
 or indirectly, overtly, or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchase,
 order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program,
 such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything
 of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual
 knowledge of the law or a specific intent to violate. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services
 resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil
 False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement
 officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. There are a number of statutory exceptions
 and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, those
 exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there is no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities, such
 as reimbursement support programs, educational and research grants or charitable donations. Practices that involve remuneration to
 those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical devices, including discounts, providing items or services for free or engaging
 such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception
 or safe harbor and would be subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute.
 Our practices, such as the loan, consignment, or purchase of certain components of our EB device to customers, may not in all cases
 meet all of the criteria for statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability; 

federal
 civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits,
 among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment
 of government funds and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid
 or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting
 from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims
 Act. Actions under the federal civil False Claims Act may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by
 a private individual in the name of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as relators or, more commonly,
 as whistleblowers, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Many pharmaceutical
 and medical device manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government
 under the federal civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities, including causing false claims to be submitted
 as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable uses and interactions with prescribers and
 other customers, including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission of claims to the federal
 government. Federal civil False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides
 for treble damages and mandatory monetary penalties for each false or fraudulent claim or statement. Because of the potential for
 large monetary exposure, healthcare and medical device companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant
 and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings; 

39 

HIPAA,
 which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute,
 a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying,
 concealing or covering up a material fact or making a materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or
 making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement
 or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

HIPAA,
 as amended by HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, also impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on
 covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as
 their business associates that perform certain services for them or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually
 identifiable health information with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable
 health information. We believe we are not a covered entity for purposes of HIPAA, and we believe that we generally do not conduct
 our business in a manner that would cause us to be a business associate under HIPAA; 

the federal
 Physician Payment Sunshine Act, also known as Open Payments, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical
 supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children s Health Insurance Program to report annually,
 with certain exceptions to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ), information related to payments
 or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group
 purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family
 members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers
 of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified
 nurse-midwives; and 

analogous
 state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply
 to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require medical device companies
 to comply with the industry s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal
 government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state beneficiary
 inducement laws, which are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other
 transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the
 privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and
 may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

State and federal regulatory
and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the U.S. Congress continues
to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Most recently, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 BBA increased the criminal
and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. Enforcement
agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies have recently increased
regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and patient support programs,
including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the Anti-Kickback Statute, federal civil False Claims Act and
HIPAA s healthcare fraud and privacy provisions. 

40 

Because of the breadth of
these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that
some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices of our EB device, and financial arrangements with physicians,
other healthcare providers, and other customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more such laws. 

Achieving and sustaining
compliance with applicable federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. If we or our employees are found to have violated
any of the above laws we may be subjected to substantial criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment, exclusion
from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and significant fines, monetary penalties, forfeiture,
disgorgement and damages, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and
the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial
results. Any action or investigation against us for the violation of these healthcare fraud and abuse laws, even if successfully defended,
could result in significant legal expenses, and could divert our management s attention from the operation of our business. Companies
settling federal civil False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute or civil monetary penalties law cases also may be required to enter into
a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG to avoid exclusion from participation (i.e., loss of coverage for their products) in federal
healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Corporate Integrity Agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to
ensure compliance. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources,
and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations
related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, in which violations of these laws could
result in substantial penalties and prosecution. 

For our sales and operations
outside the United States, we are similarly subject to various heavily enforced anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA,
U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws around the world. These laws generally prohibit U.S. companies and their employees and intermediaries
from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business or gaining any advantage. We face significant risks if we, which includes our third-party business partners and intermediaries,
fail to comply with the FCPA or other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. 

We will leverage various
third parties to conduct our business and sell our product abroad, including to government owned universities and hospitals. We, our
distributors and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government
agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities (such as in the context of obtaining government approvals, registrations or licenses or
sales to government owned or controlled healthcare facilities, universities, institutes, clinics, etc.) and may be held liable for the
corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors,
partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with
developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable
laws and regulations. To that end, we will have to adopt and implement internal control policies and procedures and employee training
and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such compliance measures ultimately may not be effective in prohibiting our employees,
contractors, business partners, intermediaries, or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and/or the law. 

Responding to any enforcement
action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management s attention and resources and significant
defense costs and other professional fees. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money
laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal
or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material
and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Regulatory compliance is expensive, complex,
and uncertain, and a failure to comply could lead to enforcement actions against us and other negative consequences for our business. 

The FDA and similar foreign
agencies will regulate our product as a medical device. Applying to and complying with these regulations is costly, time-consuming, complex,
and uncertain. For instance, before a new medical device, or a new intended use for, an existing device can be marketed in the United
States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or pre-marketing approval from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. 

41 

FDA regulations and regulations
of similar agencies are wide-ranging and include, among other things, oversight of: 

product
 design, development, manufacture (including suppliers) and testing; 

laboratory,
 preclinical and clinical studies; 

product
 safety and effectiveness; 

product
 labeling; 

product
 storage and shipping; 

record
 keeping; 

pre-market
 clearance or approval; 

marketing,
 advertising, and promotion; 

product
 sales and distribution; 

product
 changes; 

product
 recalls; and 

post-market
 surveillance and reporting of deaths or serious injuries and certain malfunctions. 

Our current product will
be subject to regulation by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Further, all of our future potential products and improvement of
our current product will be subject to regulation and will likely require permission from regulatory agencies and ethics boards to conduct
clinical trials and clearance or approval from the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale and distribution. Failure
to comply with applicable U.S. requirements regarding, for example, promoting, manufacturing, or labeling our product, may subject us
to a variety of administrative or judicial actions and sanctions, such as Form 483 observations, warning letters, untitled letters, product
recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal
prosecution. 

After we make applications,
the FDA can also refuse to clear or approve our applications. Any enforcement action by the FDA and other comparable non-U.S. regulatory
agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our failure to comply with
applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following
actions: 

untitled
 letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

unanticipated
 expenditures to address or defend such actions; 

customer
 notifications for repair, replacement, or refunds; 

recall,
 detention, or seizure of our product; 

operating
 restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

refusing
 or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products; 

42 

operating
 restrictions; 

withdrawing
 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 

refusal
 to grant export approval for our product; or 

criminal
 prosecution. 

If any of these events were
to occur, it would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may not be able to obtain
the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are
granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated use for the product, which may
limit the market for the product. 

The FDA will also regulate
the advertising and promotion of our product to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals,
that there is adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false
or misleading in any respect. If the FDA determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated
or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional
claims and make other corrections or restitutions. 

Our medical device operations will be subject
to continuing FDA regulatory requirements. 

Medical devices regulated
by the FDA are subject to general controls'' which include: registration with the FDA; listing commercially distributed products
with the FDA; complying with cGMPs under QSR; filing reports with the FDA of and keeping records relative to certain types of adverse
events associated with devices under the medical device reporting regulation; assuring that device labeling complies with device labeling
requirements; reporting certain device field removals and corrections to the FDA; and obtaining pre-market notification 510(k) clearance
for devices prior to marketing. Some devices known as 510(k)-exempt devices can be marketed without prior marketing-clearance
or approval from the FDA. In addition to the general controls, some Class II medical devices are also subject to special
controls, including adherence to a particular guidance document and compliance with the performance standard. Instead of obtaining
510(k) clearance, most Class III devices are subject to PMA. 

The medical device industry
is now experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. Companies in our industry
are subject to more frequent and more intensive reviews and investigations, often involving the marketing, business practices and product
quality management. Such reviews and investigations may result in civil and criminal proceedings; the imposition of substantial fines
and penalties; the receipt of warning letters, untitled letters, demands for recalls or the seizure of our products; the requirement
to enter into corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or other administrative remedies; and result in our incurring substantial
unanticipated costs and the diversion of key personnel and management s attention from their regular duties, any of which may have
a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may result in greater and continuing
governmental scrutiny of our business in the future. 

Additionally, federal, state,
and foreign governments and entities have enacted laws and issued regulations and other standards requiring increased visibility and
transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. Failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact
our business, and we have had and will continue to spend substantial time and financial resources to develop and implement enhanced structures,
policies, systems, and processes to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business, and which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Product clearances and approvals can often
be denied or significantly delayed. 

Under FDA regulations, unless
exempt, a new medical device may only be commercially distributed after it has received 510(k) clearance, is authorized through the de
novo classification process or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the
510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product not subject
to a PMA. Sometimes, a 510(k) clearance must be supported by preclinical and clinical data. 

43 

The PMA process typically
is more costly, lengthy, and stringent than the 510(k) process. Unlike a 510(k) review, which determines substantial equivalence, 
a PMA requires that the applicant demonstrate reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective by producing valid scientific
evidence, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. Therefore, to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals,
we typically must, among other requirements, provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical
data that demonstrate to their satisfaction that our products satisfy the criteria for approval. Preclinical testing and clinical trials
must comply with the regulations of the FDA and other government authorities in the United States and similar agencies in other countries. 

We may be required to obtain
PMAs, PMA supplements or additional 510(k) pre-market clearances to market modifications to our existing product. The FDA requires device
manufacturers to make and document a determination of whether a modification requires approval or clearance; however, the FDA can review
a manufacturer s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions not to seek approvals or clearances for particular device modifications.
If the FDA requires us to obtain PMAs, PMA supplements or pre-market clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved
device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing of the modified device and perhaps also to recall such modified device
until we obtain FDA clearance or approval. We may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 

The FDA may not approve our
current or future PMA applications or supplements or clear our 510(k) applications on a timely basis or at all. Such delays or refusals
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The FDA may also change its
clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent
or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products
on a timely basis. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

International regulatory
approval processes may take more or less time than the FDA clearance or approval process. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA and
comparable non-U.S. regulatory requirements, we may not receive regulatory clearances or approvals or may be subject to FDA or comparable
non-U.S. enforcement actions. We may be unable to obtain future regulatory clearance or approval in a timely manner, or at all, especially
if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted. For example, the FDA clearance or approval process can take longer
than anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements. A failure or delay in obtaining
necessary regulatory clearances or approvals would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our product may be subject to recalls if
we receive FDA or foreign approval or clearance, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely
affect our business. 

The FDA and similar foreign
governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of our product because of any failure to comply with applicable laws
and regulations, or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary product recall by us could occur because of,
for example, component failures, device malfunctions or other adverse events, such as serious injuries or deaths, or quality-related
issues, such as manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. Any future recalls of our product could divert managerial and financial
resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business. 

If we initiate a correction
or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publicly available
Correction and Removal report to the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified
by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers
regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors
against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation. 

44 

In addition, we will be subject
to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities if our product
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if we become aware that it has malfunctioned in a way that would likely
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred. Failures to properly identify reportable events or to file
timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to the FDA s satisfaction, can subject us to sanctions and
penalties, including warning letters and recalls. Physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers may make similar reports to regulatory
authorities. Any such reports may trigger an investigation by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies, which could divert managerial
and financial resources, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. 

If we or our suppliers fail to comply with
the FDA s Quality System Regulation or any applicable state equivalent, our operations could be interrupted, and our potential
product sales and operating results could suffer. 

The manufacturing processes
of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA s QSR, which covers the design controls, document controls, purchasing
controls, identification and traceability, production and process controls, acceptance activities, nonconforming product requirements,
corrective and preventive action requirements, labeling and packaging controls, handling, storage, distribution and installation requirements,
complaint handling, records requirements, servicing requirements and statistical techniques potentially applicable to the production
of our medical devices. We and our suppliers will also be subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing
process where we market products overseas. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available
our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic announced or unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA,
state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we experience an unsuccessful Quality System inspection, our operations
could be disrupted, and our manufacturing could be interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse
Quality System inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension
of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which
would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our revenue to decline. 

Current regulations depend
heavily on administrative interpretation. If the FDA does not believe that we are in compliance with applicable FDA regulations, the
agency could take legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products. We will also be subject to periodic inspections
by the FDA and other governmental regulatory agencies, as well as certain third-party regulatory groups. Future interpretations made
by the FDA or other regulatory bodies made during the course of these inspections may vary from current interpretations and may adversely
affect our business and prospects. The FDA s and other comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies statutes, regulations or
policies may change, and additional government regulation or statutes may be enacted, which could increase post-approval regulatory requirements,
or delay, suspend or prevent marketing of any cleared or approved products or necessitate the recall of distributed products. We cannot
predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative
action, either in the United States or abroad. 

The medical device industry
has been under heightened FDA scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions. If our operations and activities
are found to be in violation of any FDA laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties,
including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and other legal and/or agency enforcement actions. Any penalties, damages, fines,
or curtailment or restructuring of our operations or activities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial
results. The risk of us being found in violation of FDA laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions
are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend ourselves
against that action and its underlying allegations, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management s
attention from the operation of our business. Where there is a dispute with a federal or state governmental agency that cannot be resolved
to the mutual satisfaction of all relevant parties, we may determine that the costs, both real and contingent, are not justified by the
commercial returns to us from maintaining the dispute or the product. 

Various claims, design features
or performance characteristics of our medical devices that we may regard as permitted by the FDA without marketing clearance or approval,
may be challenged by the FDA or state or foreign regulators. The FDA or state or foreign regulatory authorities may find that certain
claims, design features or performance characteristics, to be made or included in the products, may have to be supported by further studies
and marketing clearances or approvals, which could be lengthy, costly and possibly unobtainable. 

45 

If any of our product causes or contributes
to a death or a serious injury or malfunction in certain ways, we will be required to report under applicable medical device reporting
regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. 

Under FDA medical device
reporting regulations MDR regulations ), medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that
a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or
contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report
events required to be reported to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action and impose
sanctions against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as
recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary
or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require our time and capital, distract management from operating our
business and may harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Healthcare reform initiatives and other
administrative and legislative proposals may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
in our key markets. 

There have been and continue
to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs
of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able
to charge for our products or the coverage and reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability
of our product. The adoption of proposals to control costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. 

For example, in the United
States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
of 2010, together, the Affordable Care Act ACA ), is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the
United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies
to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program. Implementation
of the ACA will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. For example, the ACA,
among other things, imposes a deductible excise tax of 2.3 on the sale of most medical devices, and any failure to pay this amount could
result in the imposition of an injunction on the sale of our products, fines, and penalties. 

There have been judicial
and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the former Trump administration to repeal or
replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, former President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives
designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance
mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA.
While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA
have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA includes a provision repealing, effective January 1,
2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage
for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On January 22, 2018, President Trump
signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 (the 2018 Continuing Resolution ), that delayed the
implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the 2.3 excise tax imposed on manufacturers and importers for certain sales of
medical devices through April 30, 2019. Further, the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close
the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. In July 2018, CMS published a final
rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the
ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine
this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety
because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge,
as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision,
it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. 

46 

In addition, other legislative
changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into
law, which, among other things, includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year, which went into effect on
April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027
unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law,
which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

We cannot assure you that
the ACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not harm our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how
future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. 

There likely will continue
to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance
companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm: 

our ability
 to set a price that we believe is fair for our product; 

our ability
 to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; and 

the availability
 of capital. 

Further, recently there has
been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted
in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing
and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated
that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control product costs. Additionally, individual states
in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control product pricing, including
price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency
measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what
products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment
measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures may prevent or limit our ability
to generate revenue and attain profitability. 

Various new healthcare reform
proposals are emerging at the federal and state level. Any new federal and state healthcare initiatives that may be adopted could limit
the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

If our product is not approved for planned
usage, our commercial opportunity will be severely limited. 

We currently market and sell
our EB device only for research purposes in Europe. Our strategy is to market and sell our product for drug sample collection in the
United States, upon approval or clearance from the FDA. Conducting clinical studies to obtain data for new or additional usage may require
substantial additional funding beyond our current financial abilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully obtain
clearance or approval for any product usages. 

Even if we obtain clearance
or approval to market our product for use in the United States or internationally, we cannot assure you that any such usage will be successfully
commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. If we are unable
to successfully develop our products for new or additional usages, our commercial opportunity will be limited, which would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

47 

We have limited data and experience regarding
the safety and efficacy of our product. Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and planned
studies may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy profile for such products and other planned or future products, which would
affect market acceptance of these products. 

Because our ExaBreath technology
is relatively new in the drug sample collection market, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations. The
long-term effects of using our products on a large-scale basis has not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of such
products do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects. The results of preclinical studies
and clinical trials of our product conducted to date and ongoing or future studies and trials of our current, planned, or future products
may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final
results. Our interpretation of data and results from our clinical trials do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in future
clinical trials. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies
that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials have nonetheless failed
to replicate results in later clinical trials and subsequently failed to obtain marketing approval. Products in later stages of clinical
trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. 

If our clinical trials are unsuccessful
or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, our business may be harmed. 

Clinical development is a
long, expensive, and uncertain process and is subject to delays and the risk that products may ultimately prove unsafe or ineffective
in providing the purpose for which they are designed. 

Completion of clinical trials
may take several years or more. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval
to commence a trial, if needed, in reaching an agreement on acceptable clinical trial terms with prospective sites, in obtaining institutional
review board approval at each site, in recruiting patients to participate in a trial or in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical
trial materials. 

We cannot provide any assurance
that we will successfully, or in a timely manner, enroll our clinical trials, that our clinical trials will meet their primary endpoints
or that such trials or their results will be accepted by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. 

We may experience numerous
unforeseen events during, or because of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory clearance
or approval for new products or modifications of existing products, including new purposes for existing products, including: 

enrollment
 in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or we may experience high screen failure rates in our clinical trials, resulting
 in significant delays; 

our clinical
 trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical
 and/or preclinical testing which may be expensive and time-consuming; 

trial
 results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

the FDA
 or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find the product is not sufficiently safe for use in humans; 

the FDA
 or similar foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials in different ways than
 we do; 

there
 may be delays or failure in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocols from the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

there
 may be delays in obtaining institutional review board approvals or governmental approvals to conduct clinical trials at prospective
 sites; 

the FDA
 or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or facilities unsatisfactory; 

48 

the FDA
 or similar foreign regulatory authorities may change their review policies or adopt new regulations that may negatively affect or
 delay our ability to bring a product to market or receive approvals or clearances to treat new indications; 

we may
 have trouble in managing multiple clinical sites; 

we may
 have trouble finding patients to enroll in our trials; 

we may
 experience delays in agreeing on acceptable terms with third-party research organizations and trial sites that may help us conduct
 the clinical trials; and 

we, or
 regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials because the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health
 risks. 

Failures or perceived failures
in our clinical trials will delay and may prevent our product development and regulatory approval process, damage our business prospects,
and negatively affect our reputation and competitive position. 

Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended,
or terminated for many reasons, which will increase our expenses and delay the time it takes to develop new products or seek new uses
for our product. 

We may experience delays
in our ongoing or future preclinical studies or clinical trials, and we do not know whether future preclinical studies or clinical trials
will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. 

The commencement and completion
of clinical trials for future products or their uses may be delayed, suspended, or terminated as a result of many factors, including: 

the FDA
 or other regulators disagreeing as to the design, protocol, or implementation of our clinical trials; 

the delay
 or refusal of regulators or institutional review boards IRBs to authorize us to commence a clinical trial at a prospective
 trial site; 

changes
 in regulatory requirements, policies, and guidelines; 

delays
 or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations CROs and clinical
 trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial
 sites; 

delays
 in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials; 

the inability
 to enroll a sufficient number of patients in trials to observe statistically significant effects in the trial; 

having
 clinical sites deviate from the trial protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

negative
 or inconclusive results from ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical
 studies or clinical trials or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising; 

safety
 or tolerability concerns that could cause us to suspend or terminate a trial if we find that the participants are being exposed to
 unacceptable health risks; 

reports
 from preclinical or clinical testing of other similar therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; 

49 

regulators
 or IRBs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance
 with regulatory requirements or safety concerns, among others; 

lower
 than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials; 

our CROs
 or clinical trial sites failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner,
 or at all, deviating from the protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

delays
 relating to adding new clinical trial sites; 

difficulty
 in maintaining contact with patients after trial completion, resulting in incomplete data; 

the quality
 of the product falling below acceptable standards; 

the inability
 to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to commence or complete clinical trials; and 

exceeding
 budgeted costs due to difficulty in accurately predicting costs associated with clinical trials. 

We could also encounter delays
if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs or the Ethics Committees of institutions at which such trials are being
conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend
or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory
requirements, including the FDA s current Good Clinical Practice GCP ), regulations, or our clinical protocols, inspection
of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or
adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions
or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. 

In addition, we may encounter
delays if the FDA concludes that our financial relationships with investigators result in a perceived or actual conflict of interest
that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site or the
utility of the clinical trial itself. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants
to us from time to time and receive cash compensation and/or stock options in connection with such services. If these relationships and
any related compensation to or ownership interest by the clinical investigator carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts
of interest, or if the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of
the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized,
which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing any of our
products currently in development. 

If we experience delays in
the commencement or completion of any clinical trial of our product, or if any of our clinical trials are terminated, the commercial
prospects of our product may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenue from sales may be delayed or materially diminished. 

We do not know whether any
of our future preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule,
or at all. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process
and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate associated revenue. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business,
financial condition, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion
of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial, suspension, or revocation of expanded regulatory clearance or approval of
our products. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive
right to commercialize our products or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully
commercialize our products. 

50 

We may be required to suspend or discontinue
clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our product. 

Our clinical trials may be
suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe
that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation
of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. 

If we want to market our products for uses
in the United States, we will need to file for FDA clearances or approvals and may need to conduct trials in addition to our existing
trials to support expanded use, which would be expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. The use, misuse or off-label use
of our products may also result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business. 

Our current product is not
cleared for commercial use. This prohibits our ability to market or advertise our products for any use, which restricts our ability to
sell our product and could affect our growth. Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable
laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved
by the FDA. 

Use of a device outside of
its cleared or approved indication is known as off-label use. 

However, we are not allowed
to actively promote or advertise our product for off-label uses. In addition, we cannot make comparative claims regarding the use of
our product against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical studies, which would be expensive
and time-consuming. If the FDA determines that our promotional, reimbursement or training materials for sales representatives constitute
promotion of an off-label use, the FDA could request that we modify our training, promotional or reimbursement materials or subject us
to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, disgorgement
of profits, a civil fine and criminal penalties. Other federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities also might take action if
they consider our promotion, reimbursement or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could
result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
For example, the government may take the position that off-label promotion resulted in inappropriate reimbursement for an off-label use
in violation of the federal civil False Claims Act for which it might impose a civil fine and even pursue criminal action. In those possible
events, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the product would be impaired. 

Although we will train our
sales force not to promote our product for off-label uses, and our instructions for use in all markets specify that our product is not
intended for use outside of those indications cleared or approved for use, the FDA or another regulatory agency could conclude that we
have engaged in off-label promotion. 

Our financial performance may be adversely
affected by medical device tax provisions in the healthcare reform legislation. 

The imposition of the 2.3 
medical device excise tax enacted as part of the ACA could adversely affect our financial results. Although the suspension of the excise
tax was extended to the end of 2019 by the 2018 Continuing Resolution, we do not know whether the suspension will continue beyond 2019.
We may not be able to pass along the cost of the tax to our customers or offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting
from the expansion of health insurance coverage. Ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Material future modifications to our product
may require new 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances
or approvals are obtained. 

Modifications that could
significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of our product, such as changes to the intended use or technological characteristics
of our product, will require additional new 510(k) clearances or PMAs or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices
until these clearances or approvals are obtained. Based on FDA published guidelines, the FDA requires device manufacturers to initially
make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplemental approval or clearance; however,
the FDA can review a manufacturer s decision. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety
or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA, which
could harm our operating results and require us to redesign such a product. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant
enforcement actions. 

51 

Our employees, independent contractors,
commercial partners, distributors, and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory
standards and requirements. 

We are exposed to the risk
that our employees, independent contractors, commercial partners, distributors, and vendors may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity.
Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to
us that violates: (i) the laws of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies, including those laws requiring the reporting
of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) healthcare fraud and abuse
laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate
reporting of financial information or data. These laws may impact, among other things, future sales, marketing, and education programs.
In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare
industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and
regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing, and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain
customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use
of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. 

We will adopt a code of business
conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the
precautions we take to detect and prevent these activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or
in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such
laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our
rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal
and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, additional integrity reporting and oversight
obligations, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages,
reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability
to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against any such actions or investigations,
we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of
these claims or investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Environmental and health safety laws may
result in liabilities, expenses, and restrictions on our operations. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could
subject us to significant liability. 

Federal, state, local and
foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business.
If our or our suppliers operations result in the contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances,
we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage, if any is in force, and
have a material adverse effect on our on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liability under environmental
laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations
may be expensive, and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third-party property
damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over
time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations
of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment
failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our business, financial condition,
and results of operation. 

We face risks related to our collection
and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press
about our privacy and data protection practices. 

Our business processes personal
data, including some data related to health. When conducting clinical trials, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants 
data, especially health data, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations, such as the Common Rule, GCP guidelines, or
FDA human subject protection regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security
of such data. We could be subject to attacks on our systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service
providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to users accounts using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware,
viruses, spamming, phishing attacks or other means, and may use such access to obtain users personal data or prevent use of their
accounts. Data breaches could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection and other laws, and
subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local
regulatory entities in the United States and by international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil and/or criminal
liability. Further, our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed
and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. 

52 

This risk is enhanced in
certain jurisdictions and, as we expand our operations domestically and internationally, we may be subject to additional laws in other
jurisdictions. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations could
result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These proceedings or actions may subject us to significant
penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business.
The GDPR became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes several stringent requirements for controllers
and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal
data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications,
limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e.,
key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal
data. The GDPR provides that European Union EU member states may make their own laws and regulations limiting the (i) processing
of personal data, including special categories of data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs) and (ii) profiling and automated individual decision-making of individuals, which could limit our ability to use and share
personal data or other data and could cause our costs to increase, harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with
GDPR is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to 20 million or 4 of total worldwide revenue. The interpretations
of the GDPR by local data protection authorities in EU member states, along with the complexity of the new data protection regime itself,
will leave the interpretation and enforcement of the law unclear in the near term, with potential inconsistencies across the EU member
states. The implementation and enforcement of the GDPR may subject us to enforcement risk and requirements to change certain of our data
collection, processing and other policies and practices. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and,
if we are found liable, significant damages. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be adversely
affected. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing laws and regulations relating to privacy and data
security, which enhances risks relating to compliance with such laws. 

Additionally, we are subject
to laws and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside
of the European Economic Area EEA ). We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including EU Standard Contract
Clauses. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny in recent years. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms
for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we could be prevented from transferring personal
data of users or employees in those regions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our services and thus materially
affect our operations and financial results. 

Legislative or regulatory reforms may make
it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any future products and to manufacture, market and
distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained. 

From time to time, legislation
is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture
and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted
by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations
of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of planned or future products. It is impossible to predict
whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes,
if any, may be. 

Any change in the laws or
regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current product or any future products could make it more
difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant
delays in receiving clearance or approval or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse
effect on our ability to expand our business. 

In the EU, on May 25,
2017, the new Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 or MDR was adopted. Following its entry into application
on May 26, 2020, the MDR will introduce substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply
in the EU. High risk medical devices will be subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. 

53 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain
patent or other intellectual property protection for our product, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection
obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours,
and our ability to successfully commercialize any products we may develop, and our technology, may be adversely affected. 

As with other medical device
companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our product, which will
depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims that cover, and other intellectual property with respect to, such products,
their manufacturing processes and their intended methods of use and enforcing those patent claims once granted as well as our other intellectual
property. In some cases, we may not be able to obtain issued claims covering our technologies which are sufficient to prevent third parties,
such as our competitors, from utilizing our technology. Any failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property protection
with respect to our EB product and technologies or other aspects of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 

Changes in either the patent
laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain,
and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope
of our issued patents. 

The patent prosecution process
is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or
desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable
aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality
agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees,
corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, suppliers, consultants to 3 rd parties, advisors and other
third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby
jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends
on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow our inventions to be patentable over the prior art. Furthermore,
the publication of discoveries in scientific literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United
States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot
be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in any of our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were
the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the
preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license
to third parties and are therefore reliant on our licensors or licensees. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may
not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Defects of form in the preparation or
filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example, with respect to proper priority claims,
inventorship and the like, although we are unaware of any such defects that we believe are of material importance. If we or any current
or future licensors or licensees fail to establish, maintain, protect, or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights,
such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If any current or future licensors or licensees are not fully cooperative or disagree with
us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material
defects in the form, preparation or prosecution of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and
unenforceable. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact
on our business. 

54 

The strength of patent rights
generally, and particularly the patent position of medical device companies, involves complex legal and scientific questions and can
be uncertain, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through
either legislative action to change statutory patent law or court action that may reinterpret existing law or rules in ways affecting
the scope or validity of issued patents. Any successful challenge to our patents could deprive us of exclusive rights necessary for the
successful commercialization of our products. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents may not adequately protect our
product, provide exclusivity for our product, or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the scope of any patent protection
we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to prevent our competitors from commercializing
similar or identical technology and products would be adversely affected. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents
we hold or pursue with respect to our product is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten
our ability to commercialize, our products. 

Patents have a limited lifespan.
In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent is generally 20 years after its effective filing date and the natural
expiration of a design patent is generally 14 years after its issue date, unless the filing date occurred on or after May 13, 2015,
in which case the natural expiration of a design patent is generally 15 years after its issue date. Various extensions may be available;
however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our products and services, we
may be open to competition. Further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, the period of time during which we could market
our product and services under patent protection would be reduced and, given the amount of time required for the development, testing
and regulatory review of planned or future products, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products
are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing
products similar or identical to ours. 

Moreover, the coverage claimed
in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance.
Even if patent applications we license or own, currently or in the future, issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide
us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any
competitive advantage. Any patents that we own may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Consequently,
we do not know whether our EB products and technologies will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our
competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products
in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Patents covering our product could be found
invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad. 

The issuance of a patent
is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent
offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (the USPTO ), or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter
partes review, or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our patent rights. An adverse determination
in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our patent rights,
allow third parties to commercialize our technology or product and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our
inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we may have to participate
in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as
oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge our priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our
patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being
narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical
technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology or product. Such proceedings also may result
in substantial cost and require significant time from our management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

In addition, if we initiate
legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is
invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability
are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including
lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected
with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third
parties may also raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the United States
or abroad, even outside the context of litigation, including through re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review,
interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings).
Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover
our products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity
question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware
during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part,
and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

55 

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection
depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies,
and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Obtaining and maintaining
our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural measures, document submissions, fee payments and other requirements
imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Periodic maintenance fees,
renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various
government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S.
government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the
applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent
application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors
might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual
property and proprietary rights throughout the world. 

Third parties may attempt
to commercialize competitive products or services in foreign countries where we do not have any patents or patent applications and/or
where legal recourse may be limited. This may have a significant commercial impact on our foreign business operations. 

Filing, prosecuting, and
defending patents on our product in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries
may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties
from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions
in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained
patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent
protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product, and our patents
or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 

Many companies have encountered
significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain
countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property
protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation
of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights
in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could
put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could
provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies
awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights
around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 

Many countries have compulsory
licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the
enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited
remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect
to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition and results
of operations may be adversely affected. 

56 

Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents
in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product. 

Changes in either the patent
laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution
of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met,
prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United
States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act
(the America Invents Act ), enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system
in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled
to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files
a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even
if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention
to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period
of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products
or invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. 

The America Invents Act also
includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation.
These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack
the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review
and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S.
federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient
for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented
in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would
not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents
Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the
enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition, future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO could
cause the laws and regulations governing patents to change in unpredictable ways. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our reliance on third parties requires
us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be
misappropriated or disclosed. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position
would be harmed. 

In addition to seeking patent
protection for our products, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop
and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect such proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with
our employees, collaborators, contractors, advisors, and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees.
The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses containing
invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with employees or third parties. 

We cannot guarantee that
we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
Additionally, despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including
our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed
or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts
inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully
obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology
or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or
other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. Furthermore, we expect these trade secrets, know-how
and proprietary information to over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal
articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel from academic to industry scientific positions. 

To the extent that our employees,
contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in
related or resulting know-how and inventions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. 

57 

We may be subject to claims challenging
the ownership or inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property and, if unsuccessful in any of these proceedings, we may
be required to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or to cease
the development, manufacture, and commercialization of our product. 

We may be subject to claims
that current or former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual
property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees,
or others who are involved in developing our products. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging
inventorship of our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying
monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property
that is important to our products. If we were to lose exclusive ownership of such intellectual property, other owners may be able to
license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. We also may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from
third parties, including parties involved in any such disputes. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all, or may be non-exclusive. If we are unable to obtain and maintain such licenses, we may need to cease the development, manufacture,
and commercialization of our product. The loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our patent claims could limit our ability to stop others
from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims,
litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Third-party claims of intellectual property
infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us or our collaborators may prevent or delay the sale and marketing of our
product. 

The medical device industry
is highly competitive and dynamic. Due to the focused research and development that is taking place by several companies, including us
and our competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. As such,
we could become subject to significant intellectual property-related litigation and proceedings relating to our or third-party intellectual
property and proprietary rights. 

Our commercial success depends
in part on our and any potential future collaborators ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell any products that we may
develop and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating and otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual
property rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or any potential collaborators
to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The medical device industry is characterized
by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging
patents, including interference, inter partes or post-grant review, derivation and reexamination proceedings before
the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. 

Third parties, including
our competitors, may currently have patents or obtain patents in the future and claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our product
infringes upon these patents. We have not conducted an extensive search of patents issued or assigned to other parties, including our
competitors, and no assurance can be given that patents containing claims covering our product, parts of our product, technology or methods
do not exist, have not been filed or could not be filed or issued. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue
and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending of which we are
unaware and which may result in issued patents which our current or future products infringe. Also, because the claims of published patent
applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with
claims that we infringe. As the number of competitors in our market grows and the number of patents issued in this area increases, the
possibility of patent infringement claims against us escalates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities NPEs ),
which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Third parties, including
NPEs, have claimed, and may in the future claim, that our product infringes or violates their patents or other intellectual property
rights. 

58 

In the event that any third-party
claims that we infringe their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates
litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on
questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party
patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed by our products. To successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal
court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing
evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate
the claims of any such U.S. patent. If we are found to infringe third-party patents, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such
patents are invalid or unenforceable, such third parties may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product or
technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held
invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain
a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay significant license fees and/or royalties, and the rights granted to us might
be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology. If we are unable to obtain a necessary
license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be unable to commercialize our product, or such commercialization
efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business. 

Defense of infringement claims,
regardless of their merit or outcome, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management
and other employee resources from our business, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against
us, we may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing the infringing product and/or have to pay substantial damages for use
of the asserted intellectual property, including treble damages and attorneys fees. We also might have to redesign our infringing
product or technologies, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. 

Engaging in litigation to
defend against third-party infringement claims is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition,
there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities
analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our common stock price. Such
litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities
or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation
or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more
effectively than we can because of greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties
resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings against us could impair our ability to compete
in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
or results of operations. 

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect
or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful. 

Competitors may infringe
our patents, or we may be required to defend against claims of infringement. In addition, our patents also may become involved in inventorship,
priority or validity disputes. To counter or defend against such claims can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding,
a court may decide that a patent owned by us is invalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology
at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover such technology. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or
more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery
required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised
by disclosure during litigation. 

Even if resolved in our favor,
litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract
our management and other personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results
of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to
be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our common stock price. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially
increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution
activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our
competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater
financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation
of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Any of the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We may not be successful in obtaining necessary
rights to any product we may develop through acquisitions and in-licenses. 

Many medical device companies
and academic institutions are competing with us and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. We may find it necessary
or prudent to obtain licenses from such third-party intellectual property holders. In addition, with respect to any patents we may in
the future co-own with third parties, we may require licenses to such co-owners interest to such patents. However, we may be unable
to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary
for planned or future products. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more
established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive
or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater commercialization
capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also
may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return
on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain
the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant product, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We may be subject to claims that our employees,
or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership
of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 

Our employees, and scientific
advisors may be currently or previously employed or engaged at universities or other medical device or healthcare companies, including
our competitors and potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, and advisors do not use the proprietary information
or know-how of others in their work for us, we may in the future become subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently
or otherwise, used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of their current or
former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to
paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could
result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

In addition, while it is
our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to
execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party
who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may
not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend
claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Intellectual property rights do not necessarily
address all potential threats. 

The degree of future protection
afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately
protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: 

others
 may be able to make products that are similar to our product or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims
 of our patents or that incorporate certain technology in our product that is in the public domain; 

60 

we, or
 our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the applicable issued patent
 or pending patent application that we own now or may own or license in the future; 

we, or
 our future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering our or their inventions; 

others
 may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual
 property rights; 

issued
 patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors
 or other third parties; 

our competitors
 or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then
 use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; 

we may
 not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; 

the patents
 of others may harm our business; and 

we may
 choose not to file a patent to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering
 such intellectual property. 

Any of the foregoing could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties 

From time to time, we engage outside parties
to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their
contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product. 

From time to time, we may
engage consultants to help design, monitor and analyze the results of certain of their clinical studies and trials. The consultants we
may engage will interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in their clinical trials. While we currently have no consultants
we will depend on these consultants and clinical investigators to conduct clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from
these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and in compliance with applicable regulations
and standards, such as GCP guidelines, the Common Rule, and FDA human subject protection regulations. We may face delays in our regulatory
approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely, compliant, or competent manner. If these third parties
do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain
is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may
be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful, and we may have to conduct additional studies, which would
significantly increase our costs, to obtain the regulatory clearances or approvals that we need to commercialize our products 

61 

We need to depend on third parties to manufacture
our product. If these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements and strict regulatory standards, we may be unable to develop, commercialize
or market our product. 

We depend upon third parties
to manufacture our product. Reliance on a third-party manufacturer entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured
products ourselves, including: 

reliance
 on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; 

the possible
 breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and 

the possibility
 of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on
 its own business priorities. 

Any of these factors could
cause delay or suspension of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, commercialization or marketing of our product
or cause us to incur higher costs. Furthermore, if our contract manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished
products on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable
of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely
be unable to meet demand for our product and we would lose potential revenue. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers,
or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our product at the times and in the quantities needed, could have
a material adverse effect on our business. It may take a significant amount of time to establish an alternative source of supply for
our products and to have any such new source approved by the FDA. 

We may seek strategic alliances or enter
into licensing arrangements in the future and may not be successful in doing so, and even if we are, we may not realize the benefits
or costs of such relationships. 

We may form or seek strategic
alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe
will complement or augment our sales and marketing efforts with respect to our product and any planned or future products that we may
develop. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such collaborations for our products. Any of these relationships may require
us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing
stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners
and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic
partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license,
we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such a transaction. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership
agreements related to our product could delay the commercialization of our product in certain geographies for certain indications, which
would harm our business prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

In addition, any potential
future collaborations may be terminable by our strategic partners, and we may not be able to adequately protect our rights under these
agreements. Furthermore, strategic partners may negotiate for certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization
of our product, if approved, and may not conduct those activities in the same manner as we do. Any termination of collaborations we enter
into in the future, or any delay in entering into collaborations related to our products, could delay the development and commercialization
of our product and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common
Stock 

We recently became a public company and
a n active, liquid, and orderly market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to sell your common stock. The market
price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you may not be able to sell your shares. 

Prior to our becoming a public
company, there has not been a public market for our common stock. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock
will develop. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active. 

The trading price of our
common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many
of which are beyond our control, including: 

our failure
 to increase the sales of our product; 

62 

unanticipated
 serious safety concerns related to the use of our product; 

introduction
 of new products or services offered by us or our competitors; 

announcements
 of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by our competitors; 

announcements
 of technological or innovations in ExaBreath technology; 

our ability
 to effectively manage growth; 

the size
 and growth of our target markets; 

actual
 or anticipated quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations; 

failure
 to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who cover our stock; 

failure
 to meet our own financial estimates; 

accusations
 that we have violated a law or regulation; 

recalls
 of our product; 

disputes
 or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain, maintain,
 protect, and enforce patent protection and other intellectual property rights for our technology and products; 

significant
 litigation, including stockholder litigation or litigation related to intellectual property; 

our cash
 position; 

any delay
 in any regulatory filings for our planned or future products and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect
 to the applicable regulatory authority s review of such products; 

adverse
 regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval or clearance of our planned and future products or maintain
 regulatory approval or clearance for our existing products; 

changes
 in laws or regulations applicable to our product; 

adverse
 developments concerning our suppliers or distributors; 

our inability
 to obtain adequate supplies of our product or inability to do so at acceptable prices; 

our inability
 to establish and maintain collaborations if needed; 

changes
 in the market valuations of similar companies; 

overall
 performance of the equity markets; 

sales
 of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors, and significant stockholders; 

trading volume of our common
 stock; 

63 

additions or departures of
 key personnel; 

changes in accounting principles; 

ineffectiveness of our internal
 controls; 

general
 market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our
 competitors; and 

other
 events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

In addition, the stock market
in general and the market for medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may
seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility
in the market, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against
us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources, which could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We do not intend to pay dividends on our
common stock, so any returns will be limited to increases, if any, in our stock s value. Your ability to achieve a return on your
investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock. 

We currently anticipate that
we will retain future earnings for the development, operations and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying
any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board
of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business
conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the
appreciation in the value of their stock, if any. 

Our principal stockholders and management
own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval. 

As of April 30, 2023, our
executive officers, directors and 5 stockholders beneficially owned approximately 70.34 of the outstanding shares of capital stock,
and hold 70.34 of our outstanding shares of common stock Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this
ownership position. 

A significant portion of our outstanding
shares of common stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market
price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. 

Sales of a substantial number
of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to lock-up periods under the lock-up agreements.
These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could
reduce the market price of our common stock. As of April 30, 2023, our directors, executive officers, and holders of 5 or more of our
outstanding stock beneficially owned approximately 70.34 of our outstanding stock in the aggregate. If one or more of them were to sell
a substantial portion of the shares they hold, it could cause our stock price to decline. 

Sales of our common stock
as restrictions end may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
These sales also could cause the price of our common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock. 

64 

General Risk Factors 

We are an emerging growth company, and
we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive
to investors. 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). For as long as we continue to be
an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this annual report and
our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding non binding advisory votes on executive compensation
and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five
years following the year in which we became a public company, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. We will
remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary
of the completion of our public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion or (c) in
which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which requires the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates
to exceed 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in
non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 

We will incur significant increased costs
as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 

As a public company, we will
incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will be subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which will require, among other things,
that we file with the SEC, annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC to
implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring that we evaluate
and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, beginning with our annual report for the year ending
April 30 2019, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we are no longer an emerging
growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, or a smaller reporting company under the Securities Act. Further, in July 2010, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), was enacted. There are significant corporate
governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations
in these areas such as say on pay and proxy access. Emerging growth companies are permitted to implement many of these
requirements over a longer period and up to five years after we became a public company. We intend to take advantage of this legislation
but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than anticipated or planned and thereby incur
unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and
regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and
impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. 

We expect the rules and regulations
applicable to public companies to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming
and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net
income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products
or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director
and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot
predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements
could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees,
or as executive officers. 

If we have material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially
misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing our internal control over financial reporting in which the process will
be time-consuming, costly, and complicated. Until such time as we are no longer an emerging growth company, our auditors
will not be required to attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely
manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, once required, if our independent
registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may
lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We
could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation, as well as investigations by any stock exchange on which our
securities may trade, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and
could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies. 

65 

We are at risk of securities class action litigation. 

In the past, securities class
action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially
relevant for us because medical device companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such
litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could harm our
business. 

If securities or industry analysts do not
publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our
common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities
and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities or industry analysts commence
coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts
initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research
about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish
reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. 

Without obtaining adequate capital funding
or improving our financial performance, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. 

The report of our independent
registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended April 30, 2023 includes an explanatory
paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise sufficient
capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will
need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. The inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph
by our auditors, our lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect
our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties. If we are unable
to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution
could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.

You should read the following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations together with its consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current
expectations, whose actual outcomes involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from
those stated in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections
entitled Risk Factors , Cautionary Statement regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report. 

Company Overview 

We are a medical device company
focused on developing and commercializing a product intended to transform the way biological samples are collected for analysis. We hope
to establish a new technique for an exhaled breath collection system, which we refer to as ExaBreath EB . 

Our low cost and one-time-use
EB specimen collection device, which leverages our EB technology, is non-invasive and easy-to-use, and we hope it will be able to improve
the user experience and analytical outcomes. The EB device is being prepared for commercial deployment in Europe and N. America. A 510K
application will be submitted for use in the U.S. however not for 2-3 years, which is the timeline management believes possible. There
is no guarantee that the FDA will give clearance to market our EB device in the U.S. The FDA will determine that class under which we
must file our 510K Application. We have ongoing pilot programs which, if successful, will allow us to expand the commercialization of
our product into new applications and market segments worldwide. 

We offer a new bio matrix
sample collection methodology. This is a novel and proprietary procedure for the collection, extraction, and identification of non-volatile
substances present in exhaled breath aerosols. This is not an instant screening type point of care test (POCT); instead, it is a back-to-lab
based technique, which has been developed into a complete end-to-end analytical platform for use in toxicology, pharmacology, and clinical
biochemistry. It is called ExaBreath (EB). 

EB specimen collection is
achieved using an electret membrane (electrostatic filter) and analysis is made using existing lab-based chromatographic-mass spectrometric
(LC-MS/MS) analytical instrumentation and procedures. These are the same labs and instruments that currently analyze specimens of blood,
urine, saliva, etc. 

EB can detect a wide range
of exogenous substances such as drugs of abuse and therapeutic drugs, as well as many other substances such as those prohibited in sport.
Also, EB detects certain endogenous substances associated with the study of metabolomics and the determination of biomarkers. This includes
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breath using PCR type analysis. 

We have obtained the grant
of several core technology patents for key design features and functional elements of the EB sampling device, system, and method in target
market segments across multiple countries/regions. The first method validation type data for EB was published in March 2015 by the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm to detect multiple drugs of abuse. The EB device has been used extensively for workplace drug testing in Sweden. 

There are multiple projects
running across a range of application specific studies in areas such as law enforcement (cannabis breathalyzers), workplace drug testing,
therapeutics, infectious disease testing, and sport anti-doping. Collaborative partnerships have been established in key areas and additional
published data from ongoing studies and pilots is expected. 

In early 2016, doping control
in sport was identified as a sweet spot for EB and prioritized as the target market. EB provides the anti-doping community
with significant scientific, performance and logistical benefits at all stages of the process. EB offers athletes and doping control
officers a quick, simple, hygienic, and non-intrusive collection procedure. It gives analytical labs and sport s governing authorities
the opportunity to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their anti-doping programs as well as reduce overall administrative and
logistical support costs. 

68 

Also in 2016, as part of
a global investment initiative in anti-doping research, the Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC) (www.cleancompetition.org/about/),
funded a pilot study to assess the suitability and applicability of EB as an alternative bio matrix in anti-doping. This lab study was
undertaken at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited lab in Cologne (Germany) by Dr Mario Thevis and his team. Dr Thevis is recognized
as a leading world expert in the field of doping control. The Institute of Biochemistry of the German Sport University Cologne is one
of the oldest doping laboratories in the world. The study s results were positive, and the proof-of-concept data was published
in May 2017. 

During 2017, the PCC funded
a second larger follow-on EB lab study, also performed by Dr Thevis. This study focused on substances prohibited for in-competition testing;
it too was successful. The study s data was presented to lab directors at the 36th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne,
April 2018). Further PCC funded labs studies are ongoing. 

Based on the positive method
characterization and validation data from both of Dr Thevis studies, together with data from multiple other non-sport studies/trials
performed over the last eight years by various research institutes such as the Karolinska in Sweden and the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) in Baltimore, the decision was made to proceed with an EB field study in sport. 

The PCC initiated an IRB-approved
field trial and user survey for in-competition testing of athletes to establish ease-of-use and athlete acceptance. A new anti-doping
specific EB sample collection kit was designed, developed, and produced in quantity to support the field trial. This new device/kit was
funded by the PCC. 

The trial was undertaken
by existing MLB partners. CDT doping control services based in Los Angeles, collected samples from 521 MiLB players across several US
teams. SMRTL, a WADA-accredited lab in Salt Lake City, analyzed the samples (across 3 matrices). The trial s data was presented
to lab directors at the 37th International Workshop on Doping Analysis (Cologne, Feb. 2019). This field trial was funded by the PCC. 

Expectations are high that
EB is fit-for-purpose and will be widely adopted by sports organizations and readily accepted by athletes, especially as an alternative
to the highly intrusive method of closely observed urine collection. This is particularly so for young adult athletes, where the threat
from of prohibited substances may be higher. 

US professional sports organizations
have collective annual revenues of 60bn. Doping is arguably the single biggest threat to the integrity of professional and amateur sports
in North America and worldwide. As the rewards for sporting success increase, so does the threat from doping. SensaSure, with ownership
of the EB platform, is uniquely positioned, at this critical juncture of sport and technology, to provide the next level of technology
driven protection and user-experience that clean athletes demand and sports organizations require. 

EB can achieve this, for
example, by providing a method which is suited to new platforms that support physically unattended, while virtually observed, sample
collections procedures. The COVID-19 crisis severely affected global anti-doping programs and demonstrated the need for dedicated secure
platforms that support remote sample collection from players and athletes. This same platform, together with EB, may be used for wider
applications such as telemedicine and remote health monitoring. This could include infection prevention and control precautions for COVID-19. 

Supported by a wealth of
peer reviewed published data from multiple independent lab studies and trials, together with close collaboration with our world class
research partners and strategic sponsors, while protected by a portfolio with over 100 granted patents worldwide, we are preparing for
entry into the global market of sports anti-doping as well as a wider range of applications in 2022 and beyond. 

Factors Affecting Our Business 

There are a number of factors
that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our results of operations and growth. These factors include: 

Market acceptance .
 The growth of our business depends on our ability to gain broader acceptance of our current product by continuing to make sporting
 and law enforcement aware of the benefits of our product to generate increased demand and frequency of use, and thus increase sales.
 Our ability to grow our business will also depend on our ability to expand our customer base in existing or new target end markets. 

69 

Regulatory approvals/clearances
 and timing and efficiency of new product introductions . We must successfully obtain timely approvals or clearances and introduce
 new products that gain acceptance with sports organizations, employers, and law enforcement agencies. For our sales to grow, we will
 also need to receive FDA approval for the use of our EB device and will need to obtain regulatory clearance. We believe that our
 EB device will be classified as a Class 1 medical device by the FDA. However, there is no assurance that we will be permitted to
 file as a Class 1 device nor whether we will receive clearance to sell our EB device in the U.S. Device classification depends on
 the intended use of the device and also upon indications for use. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk. 

Sales force size
 and effectiveness . The rate at which we grow our sales force and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become effective
 can impact our revenue growth or our costs incurred in anticipation of such growth. We intend to continue to make significant investments
 in our sales and marketing organization by increasing the number of U.S. sales representatives and expanding our international marketing
 programs to help facilitate further adoption among our target market. While we are not following a traditional retail business model,
 we may still need local support resources. This could involve business development and/or project manager work with strategic/commercial/manufacturing
 partners or sponsors. These resources may be hired indirectly as consultants for the duration of a particular program. 

Competition .
 Our industry is intensely competitive and, in particular, we compete with a number of large, well-capitalized companies. We must
 continue to successfully compete in light of our competitors existing and future products and related pricing and their resources
 to successfully market to the target markets who use our products. We have a portfolio of granted patents, which can serve to protect
 us from another party using our technology in the commercial market without our consent. However, there are always competitive threats.
 The main ones in our target market will come from the existing technologies and established solutions such as blood, urine, saliva
 testing. These methods are widely used and supported by many large companies compliant with recognized standards. Also, these methods
 are supported by established case law in the appropriate jurisdiction where they are in use. Companies providing test kids are Abbott,
 NMS Labs and LabCorp to mention a few. 

Clinical results .
 Publications of clinical results by us, our competitors and other third parties can have a significant influence on whether, and
 the degree to which, our product is used by sports organizations, governing bodies for sports organizations and employers and law
 enforcement. We have published data; however, more data may be required in certain applications to enable wider adoption of our product. 

While these factors may present
significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See the section titled Risk
Factors for more information. 

Components of Our Results of Operations 

Product revenue 

Product revenue is from the
sale of our EB device. Our EB device is only sold for research purposes to gather method validation data and is not approved or cleared
for use in the United States or elsewhere. 

In the future we will sell
our product to sports organizations and their associated governing bodies, primarily through direct sales representatives, as well as
through distributors in selected international markets. For products sold through direct sales representatives, control is transferred
upon delivery to customers. For products to be sold to distributors internationally and certain customers that purchase stocking orders
in the United States, control will be transferred upon shipment or delivery to the customer s named location, based on the contractual
shipping terms. 

70 

Cost of product revenue 

Cost of product revenue consists
primarily of the cost of components for use in our product, the materials and labor that are used to produce our product, manufacturing
overhead that directly supports production. We expect costs of product revenue to increase in absolute terms as our revenue grows. 

Our gross margin has been
and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, primarily production volume, the cost of direct materials, product mix, geographic
mix, discounting practices, manufacturing costs, product yields, headcount, and cost-reduction strategies. We expect our gross margin
percentage to increase over the long term to the extent we are successful in increasing our sales volume and are therefore able to leverage
our fixed costs. While we expect gross margin percentage to increase over the long term, it will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter
as we introduce new products. 

Research and development
expenses 

Research and development R D expenses consist of applicable personnel, consulting, materials, and clinical trial expenses. R D expenses
include: 

certain personnel-related
 expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonus, travel, and stock-based compensation, 

cost of clinical studies
 to support new products and product enhancements, including expenses for clinical research organizations CROs and
 site payments, 

materials and supplies
 used for internal R D and clinical activities, 

allocated overhead including
 facilities and information technology expenses, and 

cost of outside consultants
 who assist with technology development, regulatory affairs, clinical affairs, and quality assurance. 

R D costs are expensed
as incurred. In the future, we expect R D expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop new products, enhance
existing products and technologies, and perform activities related to obtaining additional regulatory approval. 

General and administrative
expenses 

General and administrative
expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, bonus, travel, and stock-based compensation. Other general
and administrative expenses include professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax fees, insurance costs, cost of outside
consultants and employee recruiting and training costs. Moreover, we expect to incur additional expenses associated with operating as
a public company, including legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing and SEC compliance and investor relations. As a result, we
expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. 

Income tax provision 

Income tax provision consists
of income taxes effects in U.S.A and Sweden jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Years
Ended April 30, 2023, and April 30, 2022 

For the year ended April 30,
2023 had minimal revenue of 4,417 (2022 - 6,424). Our efforts were concentrated on the preparation and our timely filing of 10-K and
10-Q. Thereafter, we hope to designate more time to pursue discussions with organizations that are conducting trials and testing of our
product to drive more usage of our EB device. Our revenue remained relatively static due primarily to our attention directed to studies
on the efficacy of the product and less on actual sales. 

Our loss for the year ended
April 30, 2023 was 782,953) (2022 - 1,047,609)). The net loss attributed to the company was 766,058) (2022 - 929,961)) and a net
loss of 16,895) (2022 - 117,648)) was attributed to non-controlling interests. 

Our general and administrative
expense were 617,175 compared with 878,712 for the year ended April 30, 2022. 

The decrease of 261,537 in our general and administrative
expense was mainly due to less legal and professional fees spent during year ended April 30, 2023 compared with year ended April 30, 2022,
which included our legal and professional costs related to our Registration Statement and IPO. Our sales outside of the United States
are denominated principally in Euros. As a result, we have foreign exchange exposure. We have not entered into any material foreign currency
hedging contracts, although we may do so in the future. General and administrative expense, due to the initial stage of the Company, was
mainly consisted of professional fee and legal fee and share-based compensation expenses. 

Research and development expense
decreased 3,217 compared to 165,139 for year ended April 30, 2022. And the change is not significant. 

At April 30, 2023 we have
incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Since our inception, our operations
have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our common stock, indebtedness, and, to a lesser extent, product revenue.
As of April 30, 2023 we had 26,958 (2022 - 437,177) in cash and restricted cash held in trust, and a total deficit of 1,061,593)
(2022 - 463,205)). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity is provided
by our cash on hand and cash held in a restricted account of 26,958 (2022 - 437,177). Our cash has been generated by the sale of our
stock and to a far lesser amount, sales of our product and working capital advance from shareholders. For the next 12 months we expect
our cash on hand and cash held in a restricted account to fulfill our needs. Given the product is sold for research purposes only we
do not believe we will generate any substantial revenue from product sales. 

Management believes that
it will have to rely on future stock sales to generate sufficient cash to begin operational activities. 

Cashflows 

For the year ended April
30, 2023 we had a net loss of 782,953) (2022 - 1,047,609)). The net cash used in operating activities was 435,375) (2022 - 632,119)).
Management believes the decrease of 196,744 in the net cash used in operating activities, mainly attributable to less expenses spent
for the IPO and registration process during year ended April 30, 2022.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

Not applicable. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

The information required
by Item 8 appears after the signature page to this report as a separate section beginning on page F-1. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based on their evaluation
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended) as of April
30, 2023, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report for the purpose of ensuring that
the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is made known to them by others on a timely basis,
and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported by us within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and instructions for Form 10-K. 

73 

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Immersion have been detected. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer and affected by our board of directors and management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023. Management s assessment of internal control
over financial reporting was conducted using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In performing the assessment, our management concluded that,
as of April 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on these criteria. 

Limitations on
the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. The Company s management believes that a control system, no matter how
well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal
control system are met, and no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Further, the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation
in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuers and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes to
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year end April 30, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information.

consists of one (1) members. Our Board members are not compensated through cash payments. All the members are compensated through stock
awards. 

Director Independence 

As of the date of the filing
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have no directors that qualify as independent directors. 

Compensation of Directors 

Directors who are also full-time
officers or employees of our company will receive no additional compensation for serving as directors, and directors who are not full-time
officers or employees of our company non-employee directors will receive compensation that will be developed in accordance
with PCAOB guidelines. 

Board Committees 

As of the date of this annual
report we have not established any audit, compensation or nominating and governance committees. 

Code of Ethics 

Our Code of Ethics was filed
as exhibit 14.1 to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 that was filed on October 4, 2021. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available
on the S.E.C. website at SEC.GOV. 

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification 

Our articles of incorporation,
contains no provision that limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law.
Consequently, our directors may be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties
as directors, for: 

any breach of the director s
 duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, 

any act or omission not
 in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, 

75 

unlawful payments of dividends
 or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions, or 

any transaction from which
 the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

Our articles of incorporation
do not provide for indemnification of our directors and officers. Our bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify our directors
and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law and advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final
disposition of any action or proceeding and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent
for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify
him or her under the provisions of Nevada law. We believe these limitations of liability provisions and indemnification agreements are
necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. 

A stockholder s investment
may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required
by indemnification provisions in our by-laws. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted
to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in
the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.
At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification
is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

We describe below transactions
and series of similar transactions, during our last two fiscal years or currently proposed, to which we were a party or will be a party,
in which: 

the amounts involved exceeds
 120,000, and 

any of our directors, executive
 officers, or beneficial holders of more than 5 of any class of our capital stock had or will have a direct or indirect material
 interest. 

The Company had the following
balances and transaction with related parties for years ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022: 

(a) 
 Amounts due to related

Policies and Procedures for Transactions With Related Persons 

In April 2022, our Board
of Directors adopted a written policy that our executive officers, directors, beneficial owners of more than 5 of any class of our capital
stock, and any members of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction
with us without the prior consent of our Board of Directors. Any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer,
director, beneficial owner of more than 5 of any class of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing
persons, in which such person would have a direct or indirect interest, must first be presented to our Board of Directors for review,
consideration, and approval or ratification. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our Board is to consider all relevant facts
and circumstances of the transaction available to it, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable
than terms generally available to an unrelated third party or to employees under the same or similar circumstances, that could be obtained
in an arm s length transaction and the extent of the related person s interest in the transaction. The written policy will
require that, in determining whether to approve or reject a related person transaction, our Board must consider, in light of known circumstances,
whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and those of our stockholders, as our Board determines
in good faith. 

Certain Related Person Transactions 

Other than compensation arrangements
for our directors and executive officers, which are described elsewhere in this proxy statement, below we describe transactions since
April 30, 2022 to which we were a party or will be a party, in which:

 involved exceeded or will exceed 120,000; and

 our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5 of our outstanding capital stock, or any member of the immediate family
 of, or person sharing the household with, the foregoing persons, which we refer to as our related parties, had or will have a direct
 or indirect material interest. 

The company
 has executed an agreement on January 31, 2022 between John Trainor and Connell Trainor that was for services rendered to the company
 from April 8, 2021 to January 11, 2022. There is a family relationship between Connell Trainor, the son of John Trainor, the Chairman
 of board. The agreement calls for services to be rendered, which have been completed. This agreement is no longer in effect as of
 January 31, 2022.

Item 14. Accountant Fees and Services. 

Aggregate fees by , the Company s principal independent accountants, during the last two fiscal years were as follows:

Audit Fees 
 40,000

 Tax Fees 
 -0- 
 -0- 
 
 All Other Fees 
 -0- 
 -0- 
 
 Total 
 40,000 
 -0- 

Audit Fees consist of fees
billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements and review of the interim consolidated
financial statements included in quarterly reports and services that are normally provided by our auditors in connection with statutory
and regulatory filings or engagements. 

Audit-Related Fees consist
of services by our independent auditors that, including accounting consultations on transaction related matters, are reasonably related
to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported above under Audit Fees. 

Pre-Approval of Services 

In accordance with the SEC s
auditor independence rules, the audit committee has established the following policies and procedures by which it approves in advance
any audit or permissible non-audit services to be provided to us by our independent auditor. 

Prior to the engagement of
the independent auditor for any fiscal year s audit, management submits to the audit committee for approval lists of recurring
audits, audit-related, tax and other services expected to be provided by the auditor during that fiscal year. The audit committee adopts
pre-approval schedules describing the recurring services that it has pre-approved, and is informed on a timely basis, and in any event
by the next scheduled meeting, of any such services rendered by the independent auditor and the related fees. 

The fees for any services
listed in a pre-approval schedule are budgeted, and the audit committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual
fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year. The audit committee will require additional pre-approval if circumstances arise
where it becomes necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services above the amount of fees originally pre-approved.
Any audit or non-audit service not listed in a pre-approval schedule must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee on a case-by-case
basis. Every request to adopt or amend a pre-approval schedule or to provide services that are not listed in a pre-approval schedule
must include a statement by the independent auditors as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the SEC s rules on
auditor independence. 

82 

The audit committee will
not grant approval for: 

any services prohibited
 by applicable law or by any rule or regulation of the SEC or other regulatory body applicable to us; 

provision by the independent
 auditor to us of strategic consulting services of the type typically provided by management consulting firms; or 

the retention of the independent
 auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the tax treatment of which may not be
 clear under the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations and which it is reasonable to conclude will be subject to audit procedures
 during an audit of our financial statements. 

Tax services proposed to
be provided by the auditor to any director, officer or employee of SensaSure who is in an accounting role or financial reporting oversight
role must be approved by the audit committee on a case-by-case basis where such services are to be paid for by us, and the audit committee
will be informed of any services to be provided to such individuals that are not to be paid for by us. 

In determining whether to
grant pre-approval of any non-audit services in the all other category, the audit committee will consider all relevant
facts and circumstances, including the following four basic guidelines : 

whether the service creates
 a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and us; 

whether the service places
 the auditor in the position of auditing his or her own work; 

whether the service results
 in the auditor acting as management or an employee of SensaSure; and 

whether the service places
 the auditor in a position of being an advocate for us.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of SensaSure
Technologies, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of SensaSure Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the related consolidated
statements of loss, comprehensive loss, stockholders deficiency, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2(c) to the financial statements, the has sustained
recurring losses from operations, and had a net working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit as of April 30, 2023. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard
to these matters are also described in Note 2(c). The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Sensa Bues AB Sensa Bues was
incorporated in the Kingdom of Sweden in November 2009. Sensa Bues AB owns the core intellectual properties for the design of sample
collection devices and the methodologies to collect, extract and detect the non-volatile substances presented within aerosols in exhaled
breath. These aerosols, which originate from the lungs and blood, are captured using electret-based filter technologies. This non-invasive
breath-based biological sample collection and testing methodology is called ExaBreath EB technology. 

Sensa Bues AB performs medical device design
and research focusing on developing and commercializing EB for disease detection, exposure monitoring, and drug metabolism. 

On December 21, 2020, No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded
during the reverse capitalization. As noted earlier, this transaction has been accounted for as a reversed recapitalization, the operating
results included in this discussion reflect the historical operating results of Sensa Bues AB prior to the reverse capitalization transaction. 

During April 2021, the Company increased its
ownership interest in Sensa Bues AB pursuant to private placements completed by Sensa Bues AB where common shares and 
common shares were issued to the Company and noncontrolling interests respectively. (Note 9 (b) (c)).

through several private placements, raised and respectively (Note 9 (b)). On March 30, 2021, Sensa Bues AB, through
an agreement with a vendor that is controlled by a then-director of Sensa Bues AB, modified the payment term of payable balance in the
amount of to settle the payable balance in seven installments, the payable balance became current on April 30, 2023 (Note 8

Company s common shares upon exercise of the option by the optionee (Note 8 (a) and Note 9 (b)). 

The Company s operating plan is predicated
on a variety of assumptions including, but not limited to, the level of product demand, cost estimates, its ability to continue to raise
additional financing and the state of the general economic environment in which the Company operates. There can be no assurance that
these assumptions will prove to be accurate in all material respects, or that the Company will be able to successfully execute its operating
plan. In the absence of additional appropriate financing, the Company may have to modify its operating plan or slow down the pace of
development and commercialization of its proposed products. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on the Company s
ability to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until
sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated. 

These consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects to finance their future operations
primarily through cash flow from capital contributions from the shareholders of the Company. In the event that the Company requires additional
funding to finance the growth of the Company s current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives,
the shareholders of the Company indicated the intent and ability to provide additional equity financing. 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
(COVID-19) emerged. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy,
it had spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally. 

During the past several years, as a result of
COVID-19 infections having been reported throughout both the United States and Sweden, certain national, provincial, state and local
governmental issued proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Due to the disruption of the COVID-19
crisis, the Company s business activities might be subject to certain level of adverse impact. At the date of approval of these
consolidated financial statements, it is still not possible to reliably estimate the effect of these developments as well as the impact
on the financial results and condition of the Company in future periods. Management is monitoring these developments on the Company s
operations and is taking all steps to ensure that employees are following all public health and safety protocols.
