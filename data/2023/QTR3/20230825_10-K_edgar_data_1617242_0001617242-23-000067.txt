 Business Strategy 
 We have evolved our business model from that of a traditional thrift into that of a full-service community bank. This evolution has been accomplished by growing our commercial loans and deposits, expanding our product and service offerings, de-novo branching and the acquisition of other financial institutions. During this time, our strategy has been largely focused on profitably deploying capital and enhancing earnings through a variety of balance sheet growth and diversification strategies. The key components of our business strategy are as follows: 
 Maintain Robust Capital and Liquidity Levels 
 As demonstrated by the June 30, 2023 Tier 1 Leverage ratios of the Company and the Bank of 9.07 and 8.15 , respectively, we currently maintain, and plan to continue to maintain, capital levels in excess of regulatory minimums and internal capital adequacy guidelines. 
 In addition to our robust capital levels, we maintain significant sources of both on- and off-balance sheet liquidity and plan to continue to do so. At June 30, 2023, our liquid assets included 70.5 million of short-term cash and equivalents supplemented by 1.23 billion of investment securities classified as available for sale which can be readily sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling 990.0 million via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions and 1.55 billion and 415.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and FRB, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. 
 Continue Our Technology Transformation 
 Given the ongoing evolution of our business towards digital channels, we have invested significant human resources and capital towards enhancing both our internal and client-facing technology systems. Our ongoing technology transformation will impact nearly every area of the Company including the residential and commercial lending functions, retail deposit gathering, risk management and back office operations. In fiscal 2024, we plan to accelerate our digital strategy, spearheaded by the adoption of a cloud-based, best-in-breed digital banking platform, and continue to serve our clients needs in an omnichannel environment while expanding our products and services into new markets in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
 Focus on Relationship Banking and Core Deposits 
 We focus on the acquisition and retention of core non-maturity deposit accounts and expanding customer relationships. Our philosophy is to provide superior, personalized service to our clients. In addition, we intend to increase core non-maturity deposit accounts by growing business banking relationships through expanded product lines tailored to meet our target business customers needs. Core non-maturity deposit accounts totaled 3.61 billion at June 30, 2023, representing 64.2 of total deposits. 
 Improve Our Operating Efficiency 
 In recent years, our operating efficiency has improved both organically and via economies of scale gained from merger and acquisition activity. Exclusive of potential future acquisitions, we plan to continue to improve operating efficiency through organic means, such as the increased use of technology and the continual evaluation of our branch network. We plan to continue to evaluate and optimize the performance of our existing branch network through additional branch consolidations, where appropriate. Such efforts will take into consideration historical branch profitability, market demographic trajectory, geographic proximity of consolidating branches and the expected impact on the Bank s clients and communities served. 
 During the year ended June 2023, we announced the adoption of a company-wide operating efficiency initiative that included the optimization and reduction of vendor spend, the automation or outsourcing of routine activities, and the realignment of our workforce. The result was an improvement in our non-interest expense to average assets ratio to 1.53 during the year ended June 30, 2023 from 1.73 during the year ended June 30, 2022. 
 Market Area. At June 30, 2023, our primary market area consisted of the counties in which we currently operate branches, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union counties in New Jersey and Kings (Brooklyn) and Richmond (Staten Island) counties in New York. Our lending is concentrated in New Jersey and New York and our predominant sources of deposits are the communities in which our offices are located as well as the neighboring communities.

 Competition. We operate in a highly competitive market area with a large concentration of financial institutions and we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans. A number of our competitors are significantly larger institutions with greater financial and technological resources and lending limits. Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability. Our competition for deposits and loans comes from other insured depository institutions located in our primary market area as well as out-of-market depository institutions operating via online channels and from non-depository institutions including mortgage banks, finance companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and financial technology companies. 
 
 Lending Activities 
 General. Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family mortgage loans, nonresidential mortgage loans, commercial business loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans. In recent years our lending strategies have placed increasing emphasis on the origination of commercial loans.

We originate commercial mortgage loans on a variety of multi-family and nonresidential property types, including loans on mixed-use properties which combine residential and commercial space. We generally offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate balloon mortgage loans on multi-family and nonresidential properties with final stated maturities ranging from three to 15 years with amortization terms which generally range from 15 to 30 years. Our commercial mortgage loans are primarily secured by properties located in New Jersey, New York and the surrounding states. 
 Commercial Business (C I) Loans. At June 30, 2023, commercial business loans totaled 146.9 million, or 2.5 of our loan portfolio.

Our commercial lines of credit have terms of up to one year and are generally floating-rate loans. 
 Construction Lending. At June 30, 2023, construction loans totaled 226.6 million, or 3.9 of our loan portfolio. Our construction lending includes loans to individuals, builders or developers for the construction of multi-family residential buildings or commercial real estate or for the construction or renovation of one- to four-family residences. Construction borrowers must hold title to the land free and clear of any liens. Financing for construction loans is limited to 80 of the anticipated appraised value of the completed property. Disbursements are made in accordance with inspection reports by our approved appraisal firms. Terms of financing are generally limited to one year with an interest rate tied to the prime rate and may include a premium of one or more points. In some cases, we convert a construction loan to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of construction. We have no formal limits as to the number of projects a builder has under construction or development and make a case-by-case determination on loans to builders and developers who have multiple projects under development. 
 One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans Held in Portfolio. At June 30, 2023, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled 1.70 billion, or 29.1 of our loan portfolio.

The fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate for portfolio generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ). In addition, we offer a first-time homebuyer program which provides financial incentives for persons who have not previously owned real estate and are purchasing a one- to four-family property in our primary lending area for use as a primary residence. 
 One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale. As a complement to our residential one- to four-family portfolio lending activities, we operate a mortgage banking platform which supports the origination of one- to four-family mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The loans we originate for sale generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards of Freddie Mac. Such loans are generally originated by, and sourced from, the same resources and markets as those loans originated and held in our portfolio. Our mortgage banking business strategy resulted in the recognition of 760,000 in gains associated with the sale of 103.8 million of mortgage loans held for sale during the year ended June 30, 2023. As of that date, an additional 9.6 million of loans were held and committed for sale into the secondary market.

 Asset Quality 
 Collection Procedures on Delinquent Loans. We regularly monitor the payment status of all loans within our portfolio and promptly initiate collection efforts on past due loans in accordance with applicable policies and procedures. Delinquent borrowers are notified when a loan is 30 days past due. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and additional collection notices are sent. All reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection. However, when a residential loan is 120 days delinquent and a commercial loan is 90 days delinquent, it is our general practice to refer it to an attorney for repossession, foreclosure or other form of collection action, as appropriate. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs as we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency. 
 As to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. When other real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less estimated selling costs. The initial write-down of the property, if necessary, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines are identified. 
 Past Due Loans. A loan s past due status is generally determined based upon its principal and interest P I payment delinquency status in conjunction with its past maturity status, where applicable. A loan s P I payment delinquency status is based upon the number of calendar days between the date of the earliest P I payment due and the as of measurement date. A loan s past maturity status, where applicable, is based upon the number of calendar days between a loan s contractual maturity date and the as of measurement date. Based upon the larger of these criteria, loans are categorized into the following past due tiers for financial statement reporting and disclosure purposes: Current (including 1-29 days past due), 30-59 days past due, 60-89 days past due and 90 or more days past due. 
 Additional information about our past due loans is presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Nonaccrual Loans. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when we do not expect to receive all P I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 days past due but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and we expect to receive all remaining P I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. 
 Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans PCD ). PCD loans are acquired loans that, as of the acquisition date, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Non-PCD loans are acquired loans that have experienced no or insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. To distinguish between the two types of acquired loans, we evaluate risk characteristics that have been determined to be indicators of deteriorated credit quality. The determining criteria may involve loan specific characteristics such as payment status, debt service coverage or other changes in creditworthiness since the loan was originated, while others are relevant to recent economic conditions, such as borrowers in industries impacted by the pandemic. As part of our acquisition of MSB, we acquired PCD loans with a par value of 69.4 million and an allowance for credit losses of 3.9 million. Additional information about our PCD loans is presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

 (1) TDRs on accrual status not included above totaled 10.5 million and 8.7 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Total nonperforming assets decreased by 36.7 million to 55.6 million at June 30, 2023 from 92.2 million at June 30, 2022. For those same comparative periods, the number of nonperforming loans decreased to 45 loans from 61 loans. There was one property in other real estate owned at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All nonaccrual loans held-for sale at June 30, 2022 were sold during the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 At June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had loans with aggregate outstanding balances totaling 17.4 million and 22.2 million, respectively, reported as TDRs. 
 Loan Review System. We maintain a loan review system consisting of several related functions including, but not limited to, classification of assets, calculation of the allowance for credit losses, independent credit file review as well as internal audit and lending compliance reviews. We utilize both internal and external resources, where appropriate, to perform the various loan review functions, all of which operate in accordance with a scope and frequency determined by senior management and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 As one component of our loan review system we engage a third-party firm which specializes in loan review and analysis functions. As part of their review process, our third-party review firm compares their review results with their client base to evaluate our risk assessment among our peers. This firm assists senior management and the Board of Directors in identifying potential credit weaknesses; in reviewing and confirming risk ratings or adverse classifications internally ascribed to loans by management; in identifying relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolio and identifying segments of the portfolio that are potential problem areas; in verifying the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; in evaluating the activities of lending personnel including compliance with lending policies and the quality of their loan approval, monitoring and risk assessment; and by providing an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio. Currently, third-party loan reviews are being conducted quarterly and include non-performing loans as well as samples of performing loans of varying types within our portfolio. 
 In addition, our loan review system includes functions performed by internal audit and compliance personnel. Internal audit resources perform credit review functions utilizing guidance from regulatory and Institute of Internal Auditors standards in addition to assessing the adequacy of, and adherence to, internal credit policies and loan administration procedures and adherence to regulatory guidance. Our compliance resources monitor adherence to relevant lending-related and consumer protection-related laws and regulations.

 Classification of Assets. In compliance with the regulatory guidelines, our loan review system includes an evaluation process through which certain loans exhibiting adverse credit quality characteristics are classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. An asset is classified as Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets, or portions thereof, classified as Loss are considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses are designated as Special Mention by management. Adversely classified assets, together with those rated as Special Mention are generally referred to as Classified Assets. Non-classified assets are internally rated within one of four Pass categories or as Watch with the latter denoting a potential deficiency or concern that warrants increased oversight or tracking by management until remediated. 
 Additional information about our classification of assets is presented in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 The following table discloses our designation of certain loans as special mention or adversely classified during each of the two years presented: 
 At June 30, 2023 2022 (In Thousands) Special mention 17,674 12,740 Substandard 75,777 81,650 Doubtful 75 165 Total classified loans 93,526 94,555 
 Individually Evaluated Loans . On a case-by-case basis, we may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on its disparate risk characteristics. When we determine that a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the portfolio, the allowance will be determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral as of the reporting date, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized cost basis of the loan, we will establish an allowance for the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at the reporting date and the amortized cost basis of the loan. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans 
 On July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology, referred to as the CECL methodology. See Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of Topic 326. 
 A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for credit losses is set forth in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 Additional information about our allowance for credit losses is also presented in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses in financial assets at the balance sheet date. The following table presents allowance for credit losses ratios, along with the components of their calculation, for the periods indicated: 
 At June 30, 2023 2022 (Dollars in Thousands) Allowance for credit losses - loans 48,734 47,058 Total loans outstanding 5,850,476 5,436,576 Total non-performing loans 42,627 70,321 Allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans outstanding 0.83 0.87 Allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans 114.33 66.92

 Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses ACL allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans receivable at the dates indicated. The ACL allocated to each category is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover lifetime expected credit losses inherent in any particular category as of the balance sheet date and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. 
 At June 30, 2023 2022 Amount Percent of Loans to Total Loans Amount Percent of Loans to Total Loans (Dollars In Thousands) Multi-family mortgage 26,362 47.21 25,321 44.31 Nonresidential mortgage 8,953 16.56 10,590 18.76 Commercial business 1,440 2.51 1,792 3.25 Construction 1,336 3.87 1,486 2.58 One- to four-family residential mortgage 10,237 29.07 7,540 30.27 Home equity loans 338 0.74 245 0.78 Other consumer 68 0.04 84 0.05 Total 48,734 100.00 47,058 100.00 
 At June 30, 2023, the ACL totaled 48.7 million, or 0.83 of total loans, reflecting an increase of 1.7 million from 47.1 million, or 0.87 of total loans, at June 30, 2022. The increase was largely attributable to a provision for credit losses of 2.5 million, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the expected life of the loan portfolio. Partially offsetting the provision for credit losses were net charge-offs of 810,000. 
 The ACL at June 30, 2023 is maintained at a level that is management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in loans at the balance sheet date. The ACL is subject to estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available and as events or conditions effecting individual borrowers and the marketplace as a whole change over time. Additions to the ACL may be necessary if the future economic environment deteriorates from forecasted conditions. In addition, the banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios, related ACL and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The regulators may require the ACL to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which may negatively affect our earnings. 
 Additional information about the ACL at June 30, 2023 and 2022 is presented in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Investment Securities 
 At June 30, 2023, our investment securities portfolio totaled 1.37 billion and comprised 17.0 of our total assets. By comparison, at June 30, 2022, our securities portfolio totaled 1.46 billion and comprised 18.9 of our total assets. Additional information about our investment securities at June 30, 2023 is presented in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 The year-over-year net decrease in the securities portfolio totaled 88.2 million which largely reflected repayments and sales that were partially offset by purchases. The decrease in the portfolio included a 38.1 million decrease in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio to an unrealized loss of 156.1 million at June 30, 2023 from an unrealized loss of 118.0 million at June 30, 2022. 
 Our investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, is designed to foster earnings and manage cash flows within prudent interest rate risk and credit risk guidelines, taking into consideration our liquidity needs, asset/liability management goals, and performance objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Treasurer/Chief Investment Officer are the senior management members of our Capital Markets Committee that are designated by the Board of Directors as the officers primarily responsible for securities portfolio management and all transactions require the approval of at least two of these designated officers. 
 The investments authorized for purchase under the investment policy approved by our Board of Directors include U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency debentures, municipal obligations, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and subordinated debt.

Table of Contents 

 The carrying value of our mortgage-backed securities totaled 710.0 million at June 30, 2023 and comprised 51.7 of total investments and 8.8 of total assets as of that date. We generally invest in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies or government-sponsored entities. Mortgage-backed securities issued or sponsored by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored entities are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest to investors. 
 The carrying value of our securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions totaled 16.1 million at June 30, 2023 and comprised 1.2 of total investments and less than 1.0 of total assets as of that date. Such securities primarily included highly-rated, fixed-rate bank-qualified securities representing general obligations of municipalities located within the U.S. or the obligations of their related entities such as boards of education or school districts. Each of our municipal obligations were consistently rated by Moody s and S P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling A- or higher by S P or A2 or higher by Moody s, where rated by those agencies. In the absence of, or as a complement to, such ratings, we rely upon our own internal analysis of the issuer s financial condition to validate its investment grade assessment. 
 The carrying value of our asset-backed securities totaled 136.2 million at June 30, 2023 and comprised 9.9 of total investments and 1.7 of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities representing securitized federal education loans with 97 U.S. government guarantees. Our securities represent the highest credit-quality tranches within the overall structures with each being rated AA+ or higher by S P or Aa1 or higher by Moody s, where rated by those agencies. 
 The outstanding balance of our collateralized loan obligations totaled 377.0 million at June 30, 2023 and comprised 27.4 of total investments and 4.7 of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised entirely of structured, floating-rate securities representing securitized commercial loans to large, U.S. corporations. At June 30, 2023, each of our collateralized loan obligations were consistently rated by Moody s and/or S P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling AAA by S P or Aaa by Moody s, where rated by those agencies. 
 The carrying value of our corporate bonds totaled 135.0 million at June 30, 2023 and comprised 9.8 of total investments and 1.7 of total assets as of that date. This category of securities is comprised of two floating-rate corporate debt obligations issued by large financial institutions and subordinated debt representing profitable, well-capitalized, small- to mid-sized community banks located mainly in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. At June 30, 2023, corporate bonds issued by large financial institutions were consistently rated by Moody s and S P well above the thresholds that generally support our investment grade assessment with such ratings equaling BBB- or higher by S P or Baa3 or higher by Moody s, where rated by those agencies. 
 Current accounting standards require that debt securities be categorized as held to maturity or available for sale, based on management s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. These standards allow debt securities to be classified as held to maturity and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as held to maturity. 
 We do not currently use or maintain a trading account. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale. These securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of equity. As of June 30, 2023, our available for sale securities portfolio had a carrying value of 1.23 billion or 89.3 of our total securities with the remaining 146.5 million or 10.7 of securities were classified as held to maturity. 
 Other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, we did not hold securities of any one issuer having an aggregate book value in excess of 10 of our equity at June 30, 2023. All of our securities carry market risk insofar as increases in market interest rates have caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in their market value. We believe that unrealized and unrecognized losses on securities held at June 30, 2023, are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded at that time. 
 During the year ended June 30, 2023, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled 105.2 million and resulted in no gross gains and gross losses of 15.2 million. During the year ended June 30, 2022, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled 100.3 million and resulted in no gross gains and gross losses of 565,000. During the year ended June 30, 2021, proceeds from sales of securities available for sale totaled 98.1 million and resulted in gross gains of 1.2 million and gross losses of 470,000. There were no sales of held to maturity securities during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

 Sources of Funds 
 General. Retail deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition, we derive funds from principal repayments of loan and investment securities. Loan and securities payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Wholesale funding sources including, but not limited to, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB ), wholesale deposits and other short-term borrowings are also used to supplement the funding for loans and investments. 
 Deposits. Our current deposit products include interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from 30 days to five years. Certificates of deposit with terms ranging from six months to five years are available for individual retirement account plans. Deposit account terms, such as interest rate earned, applicability of certain fees and service charges and funds accessibility, will vary based upon several factors including, but not limited to, minimum balance, term to maturity, and transaction frequency and form requirements. 
 Deposits are obtained primarily from within New Jersey and New York through the Bank s network of retail branches, business relationship officers, treasury management officers and digital banking channels. We maintain a robust suite of commercial deposit products designed to appeal to small and mid-size businesses, non-profit organizations and government entities. Our team of experienced and dedicated business relationship officers serve as the primary points of contact for these commercial clients and act as both new business originators and relationship managers. 
 The determination of interest rates on retail deposits is based upon a number of factors, including: (1) our need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs; (2) a current survey of a selected group of competitors rates for similar products; (3) our current cost of funds, yield on assets and asset/liability position; and (4) the alternate cost of funds on a wholesale basis. Interest rates are reviewed by senior management on a regular basis, with deposit product and pricing updated, as appropriate, during recurring and ad-hoc senior management meetings. 
 Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit maturing within a short period were not renewed. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, certificates of deposit maturing within one year were 1.90 billion and 1.47 billion, respectively. Historically, a significant portion of the certificates of deposit remain with us after they mature. 
 At June 30, 2023, 1.42 billion or 70.6 of our certificates of deposit were certificates of 100,000 or more compared to 1.33 billion or 70.2 at June 30, 2022. Excluding brokered certificates of deposit, 783.7 million or 56.9 of our certificates of deposit were certificates of 100,000 or more at June 30, 2023. The general level of market interest rates and money market conditions significantly influence deposit inflows and outflows. The effects of these factors are particularly pronounced on deposit accounts with larger balances. In particular, certificates of deposit with balances of 100,000 or greater are traditionally viewed as being a more volatile source of funding than comparatively lower balance certificates of deposit or non-maturity transaction accounts. In order to retain certificates of deposit with balances of 100,000 or more, we may have to pay a premium rate, resulting in an increase in our cost of funds. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with wholesale funding. 
 Our sources of wholesale funding included brokered certificates of deposit and listing service certificates of deposit whose balances totaled approximately 635.3 million and 5.2 million, or 11.3 and 0.1 of total deposits, respectively, at June 30, 2023. We utilize brokered certificates of deposit and listing service certificates of deposits as alternatives to other forms of wholesale funding, including borrowings, when interest rates and market conditions favor the use of such deposits. For a portion of our short-term brokered certificates of deposit we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend their duration and to fix their cost.

 Borrowings. The sources of wholesale funding we utilize include borrowings in the form of advances from the FHLB as well as other forms of borrowings. We generally use wholesale funding to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and liquidity risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. 
 Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by our FHLB capital stock and certain investment securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans that we choose to utilize as collateral for such borrowings. Additional information about our FHLB advances is included under Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 At June 30, 2023, we had 1.28 billion of FHLB advances outstanding, excluding a net fair value adjustment of 688,000, at a weighted average interest rate of 4.92 . At June 30, 2022, we had 652.5 million of FHLB advances outstanding, excluding a net fair value adjustment of 1.2 million, at a weighted average interest rate of 2.17 . 
 Our FHLB advances mature as follows: 
 At June 30, 2023 2022 (In Thousands) By remaining period to maturity: Less than one year 972,500 520,000 One to two years 103,500 22,500 Two to three years 6,500 103,500 Three to four years 6,500 Four to five years 200,000 Greater than five years Total advances 1,282,500 652,500 Fair value adjustments (688) (1,163) Total advances, net of fair value adjustments 1,281,812 651,337 
 At June 30, 2023, we utilized interest rate contracts to effectively extend the duration and fix the cost of our FHLB advances maturing in less than one year. 
 Based upon the market value of investment securities and mortgage loans that are posted as collateral for FHLB advances at June 30, 2023, we are eligible to borrow up to an additional 1.55 billion of advances from the FHLB as of that date. We are further authorized to post additional collateral in the form of other unencumbered investments securities and eligible mortgage loans that may expand our borrowing capacity with the FHLB up to 30 of our total assets. Additional borrowing capacity up to 50 of our total assets may be authorized with the approval of the FHLB s Board of Directors or Executive Committee. 
 In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling 990.0 million via unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions and 415.0 million from the FRB without pledging additional collateral. 
 The balance of borrowings at June 30, 2023 included overnight line of credit borrowings from the FHLB totaling 125.0 million and unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions totaling 100.0 million. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging 
 We utilize derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps, caps and floors to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk in conjunction with our overall asset/liability management process. In accordance with accounting requirements, we formally designate all of our hedging relationships as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, and document the strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions and its method of assessing ongoing effectiveness. 
 At June 30, 2023, our derivative instruments were comprised of interest rate swaps, caps and a floor with a total notional amount of 2.23 billion. These instruments are intended to manage the interest rate exposure relating to certain wholesale funding positions and assets that were outstanding at June 30, 2023. 
 Additional information regarding our use of interest rate derivatives and our hedging activities is presented in Note 1 and Note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

 Supervision and Regulation 
 Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial operate in a highly regulated industry. This regulation establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings and loan holding company and New Jersey savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 
 Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution and its holding company, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including changes in the regulations governing savings and loan holding companies, could have a material adverse impact on Kearny Financial, Kearny Bank and their operations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of Kearny Bank and/or Kearny Financial or impose burdensome requirements upon one or both of them could reduce their profitability and could impair the value of Kearny Bank s franchise, resulting in negative effects on the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 Regulation of Kearny Bank 
 General. As a nonmember New Jersey savings bank with federally insured deposits, Kearny Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the NJDBI and the FDIC. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory agencies widespread discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies regarding the classification of assets and the level of the allowance for credit losses. The activities of New Jersey savings banks are subject to extensive regulation including restrictions or requirements with respect to loans to one borrower, dividends, permissible investments and lending activities, liquidity, transactions with affiliates and community reinvestment. Both state and federal law regulate a savings bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of Kearny Bank s mortgage documents. 
 Kearny Bank must file reports with the NJDBI and FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition and obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as establishing new branches and mergers with or acquisitions of other depository institutions. The NJDBI and FDIC regularly examine Kearny Bank and prepare reports to Kearny Bank s Board of Directors on any deficiencies found in its operations. The agencies have substantial discretion to take enforcement action with respect to an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or engages in violations of law or unsafe and unsound practices. Such actions can include, among others, the issuance of a cease and desist order, assessment of civil money penalties, removal of officers and directors and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
 Activities and Powers. Kearny Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and the related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, New Jersey savings banks, including Kearny Bank, generally may invest in real estate mortgages; consumer and commercial loans; specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; certain types of corporate equity securities and other specified assets. 
 A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act. Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on individual and aggregate amounts of investments. New Jersey savings banks may also exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks, federal savings banks or federal savings associations, or either directly or through a subsidiary. New Jersey savings banks may exercise powers, rights, benefits and privileges of out-of-state banks, savings banks and savings associations, or either directly or through a subsidiary, provided that prior approval by the NJDBI is required before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is further limited by federal law and the related regulations. See Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks below. 
 Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as principal and equity investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, except such activities and investments that are specifically exempted by law or regulation, or approved by the FDIC. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 Before engaging as principal in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank, or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC, subject to certain specified exceptions. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional requirements. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance. Kearny Bank s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. The general maximum deposit insurance amount is 250,000 per depositor. 
 The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF ). Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion of assets, such as Kearny Bank, are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution s failure within three years. The assessment range for insured institutions of less than 10 billion of total assets is 1.5 to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
 Assessment rates for institutions of Kearny Bank s size ranged from 1.5 to 30 basis points effective through December 31, 2022. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of Kearny Bank s size ranged from 2.5 to 32 basis points. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require nonmember banks to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8 , and a 4 Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The current requirements implement recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of federal law. 
 For purposes of the regulatory capital standards, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. 
 Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45 of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. At June 30, 2023, Kearny Bank has exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to equity interests depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. At June 30, 2023, Kearny Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but also qualitative factors. The FDIC has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 Depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a leverage ratio of greater than 9 , to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. Kearny Bank did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework as of June 30, 2023. 
 Regulations issued by the NJDBI establish generally similar regulatory capital standards for New Jersey-chartered savings banks such as Kearny Bank. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5 or greater. 
 An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 . An institution is categorized as significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 . Critically undercapitalized status is triggered if an institution has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0 . Qualifying banks that elect and comply with the community bank leverage ratio (as established by the regulatory agencies) are considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. 
 Undercapitalized banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5 of the institution s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status adequately capitalized status. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after such status is triggered. These actions are in addition to other discretionary supervisory or enforcement actions that the FDIC may take. 
 As of June 30, 2023, Kearny Bank was well capitalized. 
 Dividend Limitations. Federal regulations impose various restrictions or requirements on Kearny Bank to pay dividends to Kearny Financial. An institution that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Kearny Bank, must file notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least thirty days before paying a dividend. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a notice if: (i) the savings institution would be undercapitalized following the capital distribution; (ii) the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or (iii) the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, enforcement action or agreement or condition imposed in connection with an application. 
 New Jersey law specifies that no dividend may be paid if the dividend would impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, no dividend may be paid unless the savings bank would, after payment of the dividend, have a surplus of at least 50 of its capital stock (or if the payment of dividend would not reduce surplus).

 Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a depository institution (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of an institution is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the institution. In a holding company context, the parent holding company and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to 10 of such institution s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such institution s capital stock and surplus. The term covered transaction includes an extension of credit, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit and similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. 
 The law also requires that affiliate transactions generally be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same as, or at least as favorable to the institution as, those provided to non-affiliates. 
 Kearny Bank s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, subject to certain exceptions, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 
 not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Kearny Bank s regulatory capital. 
 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Kearny Bank s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA ), every insured depository institution, including Kearny Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess the depository institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider that record in its consideration of certain applications by the institution, such as for a merger or the establishment of a branch office. The FDIC may use an unsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for denying such an application. Kearny Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating from the FDIC in its most recent CRA evaluation. 
 On May 5, 2022, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations and the related regulatory framework. 
 Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations . The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: 
 Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100 or more of the bank s capital; or 
 Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300 or more of the bank s total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months. 
 24

 The guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Kearny Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, which is one of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by financial institutions and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members pursuant to policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. 
 As a member, Kearny Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of New York in specified amounts. The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral and limiting total advances to a member. 
 The FHLB of New York may pay periodic dividends to members. These dividends are affected by factors such as the FHLB s operating results and statutory responsibilities that may be imposed such as providing certain funding for affordable housing and interest subsidies on advances targeted for low- and moderate-income housing projects. The payment dividends, or any particular amount of dividend, cannot be assumed.

Bank service providers are also required to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services as soon as possible after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided to such bank for four or more hours. 
 
 Regulation of Kearny Financial 
 General. Kearny Financial is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of federal law. Kearny Financial maintained its savings and loan holding company status (rather than becoming a bank holding company), notwithstanding the June 2017 conversion of Kearny Bank to a New Jersey savings bank charter, through Kearny Bank exercising an election available to it under federal law. Kearny Financial is required to file reports with, and is subject to regulation and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. Kearny Financial must also obtain regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board before engaging in certain transactions, such as mergers with or acquisitions of other depository institutions. 
 In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Kearny Financial and any non-depository subsidiaries. That permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to pose a serious risk to Kearny Bank. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for protection of Kearny Bank s depositors and not for the benefit of stockholders of Kearny Financial. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that, to the greatest extent possible taking into account any unique characteristics of savings and loan holding companies and the requirements of federal law, its approach is to apply to savings and loan holding companies the supervisory principles applicable to the supervision of bank holding companies. The stated objective of the Federal Reserve Board is to ensure the savings and loan holding company and its non-depository subsidiaries are effectively supervised, can serve as a source of strength for and do not threaten the safety and soundness of, the subsidiary depository institution. 
 Nonbanking Activities. As a savings and loan holding company, Kearny Financial is permitted to engage in those activities permissible under federal law for financial holding companies (if certain criteria are met and an election is submitted) and for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Mergers and Acquisitions. Kearny Financial must generally obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5 of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation, or purchase of its assets. Federal law also prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring more than 5 of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized for savings and loan holding companies by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating an application for Kearny Financial to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Kearny Financial and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance fund, the convenience and the needs of the community served and competitive factors. A merger of another depository institution into Kearny Bank requires the prior approval of the NJDBI and FDIC, based on similar considerations.

 Consolidated Capital Requirements. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions (including the community bank leverage ratio alternative) apply to savings and loan holding companies with 3 billion or more of consolidated assets, including Kearny Financial. Kearny Financial was in compliance with the holding company capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer as of June 30, 2023. 
 Source of Strength Doctrine; Dividends. Federal law extended the source of strength doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial distress. Further, the Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also applied to savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve supervisory staff as to dividends in certain circumstances, such as when the dividend is not covered by earnings for the period for which it is being paid, when net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or when the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. In addition, a subsidiary institution of a savings and loan holding company must file prior notice with the Federal Reserve Board, and receive its non-objection, before paying a dividend to the parent savings and loan holding company. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for regulatory review of certain stock redemption and repurchase proposals by holding companies. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Kearny Financial to pay dividends, engage in stock redemptions or repurchases or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for Kearny Financial to be regulated by the Federal Reserve Board as a savings and loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Kearny Bank must remain a qualified thrift lender under applicable law or satisfy the domestic building and loan association test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified thrift lender test, an institution is generally required to maintain at least 65 of its portfolio assets (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20 of total assets; (ii) intangible assets, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain qualified thrift investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12 month period. As of June 30, 2023, Kearny Bank met the qualified thrift lender test. 
 Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire control of a savings and loan holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock of a savings and loan holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial condition of the acquirer, and future prospects of the proposed acquirer, the competence and integrity of the proposed acquirer and the effects of the acquisition on competition. Any company that seeks to acquire control of Kearny Financial or Kearny Bank, within the meaning of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, must file an application, and receive the Federal Reserve Board s prior approval under that statute. The Company would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. 
 The prior approval of the NJDBI would also be necessary for the acquisition of 25 of a class of the Company s voting stock, or control as otherwise defined under New Jersey law. 
 Incentive Compensation . In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule implementing the incentive-based compensation recovery clawback provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule directs national securities exchanges and associations, including NASDAQ, to require listed companies to develop and implement clawback policies to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of a required accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and to disclose their clawback policies and any actions taken under these policies. On June 9, 2023, the SEC approved the NASDAQ proposed clawback listing standards, including the amendments that delay the effective date of the rules to October 2, 2023. Each listed issuer, including Kearny Financial, is required to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after the effective date, or December 1, 2023.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 An investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to these risks and any other risks or uncertainties described in Item 1. Business Forward-Looking Statements and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 Economic and Market Area 
 Changes in economic conditions, in particular an economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could materially and negatively affect our business. 
 Our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Any deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by national or local concerns, in particular any further economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decrease; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans. 
 Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic downturn or prolonged recession may result in the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would hurt its business. If we experience an economic downturn or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans as scheduled. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has remained at an elevated level through 2022 and 2023. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our stock price may be negatively impacted by unrelated bank failures and negative depositor confidence in depository institutions. Further, if we were unable to adequately manage our liquidity, deposits, capital levels and interest rate risk, which have come under greater scrutiny in light of recent bank failures, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 On March 9, 2023, Silvergate Bank, La Jolla, California, announced its decision to voluntarily liquidate its assets and wind down operations. On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the DFPI ), on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank, New York, New York, was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services and on May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank, San Francisco, California, was closed by the DFPI, and in each case the FDIC was appointed receiver for the failed institution. These banks had elevated levels of uninsured deposits, which may be less likely to remain at the bank over time and less stable as a source of funding than insured deposits. These failures led to volatility and declines in the market for bank stocks and questions about depositor confidence in depository institutions. 
 These events have led to a greater focus by institutions, investors and regulators on the on-balance sheet liquidity of and funding sources for financial institutions, the composition of its deposits, including the amount of uninsured deposits, the amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss, capital levels and interest rate risk management.

 If we are unable to adequately manage our liquidity, deposits, capital levels and interest rate risk, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from loan repayments, investment maturities and income on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize the generation of low-cost core deposits as a source of funding, there is strong competition for such deposits in our market area. Additionally, deposit balances can decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Accordingly, as a part of our liquidity management, we must use a number of funding sources in addition to deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments, which may include Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advances, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates of deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, pay our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 A lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators. Depending on the capitalization status and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is subject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. 
 Our financial flexibility would be severely constrained if we were unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing were not available at acceptable interest rates. Further, if we were required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support liquidity, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our increased costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. If alternative funding sources were no longer available to us, we may need to sell a portion of our investment and/or loan portfolio to raise funds, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in us realizing a loss on the sale of such assets. As of June 30, 2023, we had a net unrealized loss of 156.1 million on our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as a result of the rising interest rate environment. Our investment securities totaled 1.37 billion, or 17.0 of total assets, at June 30, 2023. The details of this portfolio are included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Severe weather could harm our business. 
 Weather-related events, including those that may result from climate change, can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The occurrence of a natural disaster could result in one or more of the following: (i) an increase in loan delinquencies; (ii) an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; (iii) a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or (iv) a decrease in the value of the collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing clients borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage. Weather-related events may cause significant flooding and other storm-related damage and these outcomes may become more common in the future. 
 Acts of terrorism, public health issues, and geopolitical and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business. 
 Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, global markets may be adversely affected by the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber attacks or campaigns, military conflicts, terrorism or other geopolitical events, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The impact of global market fluctuations may affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.

 Our inability to achieve profitability on new branches may negatively affect our earnings. 
 We have expanded our presence throughout our market area and we intend to pursue further expansion through de novo branching or the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches. We expect that it may take a period of time before these branches can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our net income. 
 We face intense competition from other financial services and financial services technology companies, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business or financial performance. 
 We face intense competition in all of its markets and geographic regions. We expect competitive pressures to intensify in the future, especially in light of legislative and regulatory initiatives arising out of the recent global economic crisis, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current economic and market conditions, and government monetary and fiscal policies. Competition with financial services technology companies, or technology companies partnering with financial services companies, may be particularly intense, due to, among other things, differing regulatory environments. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans or raising the interest rates on deposits in order to keep or attract high-quality clients. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. The actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of its products and other services, developing and maintaining a strong client base, or prudently managing expenses. 
 Asset Quality and Interest Rate 
 Changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. 
 We derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income. 
 Beginning in March 2022, in response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve Board s Federal Open Market Committee systemically increased the target rate from 0.00 0.25 to 5.25 5.50 in July 2023. In addition, at June 30, 2023, short-term rates were meaningfully lower than long-term rates, which results in an inverted yield curve. Our net interest spread and net interest margin are at risk of being reduced due to potential increases in our cost of funds that may outpace any increases in our yield on interest-earnings assets. 
 Interest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, an increase in interest rates generally results in decreased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as borrowers are less likely to refinance their debt. Changes in market interest rates also impact the value of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the value of our derivatives portfolios. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives serving as cash flows hedges are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders equity. Consequently, declines in the fair value of these instruments resulting from changes in market interest rates have, and may continue to, adversely affect stockholders equity. 
 If our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. 
 We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the required amount of the allowance for credit losses, we evaluate loans individually and establish credit loss allowances for specifically identified impairments. For loans not individually analyzed, we estimate losses and establish reserves based on reasonable and supportable forecasts and adjustments for qualitative factors. If the assumptions used in our calculation methodology are incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in further additions to our allowance. Our allowance for credit losses on loans was 0.83 of total loans at June 30, 2023 and significant additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income. 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 A significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we classify a significant portion of our investment securities as available for sale, which creates potential volatility in our equity and may have an adverse impact on our net income. 
 As of June 30, 2023, our securities portfolio totaled 1.37 billion, or 17.0 of our total assets. Investment securities typically have lower yields than loans. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the weighted average yield of our investment securities portfolio was 3.55 , as compared to 4.00 for our loan portfolio. 
 Accordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. Additionally, at June 30, 2023, 1.23 billion, or 89.3 of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income. 
 Our commercial lending exposes us to additional risk. 
 Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on commercial lending. Our increased commercial lending, however, exposes us to greater risks than one- to four-family residential lending. Unlike single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from employment and other income sources, and are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable and realizable, the repayment of commercial loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions, and are secured, if at all, by collateral that is more difficult to value or sell or by collateral which may depreciate in value. In addition, commercial loans generally carry larger balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers than one- to four-family mortgage loans, which increases the financial impact of a borrower s default. 
 The risk exposure from our increased commercial lending is also a function of the markets in which we operate. Our commercial lending activity is generally focused on borrowers domiciled, and real estate located, within the states of New Jersey and New York. Regional risk factors and changes to local laws and regulations, including changes to rent regulations or foreclosure laws, may present greater risk than a more geographically diversified portfolio. 
 Our increased commercial business and construction loan originations exposes us to increased credit risk. 
 We have increased our originations of commercial business and construction loans, which generally have more risk than both one- to four-family residential and commercial mortgage loans. Since repayment of commercial business and construction loans may depend on the successful operation of the borrower s business or the successful completion of a construction project, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. If we continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for credit losses because of the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any such increase to our allowance for credit losses would adversely affect our earnings. 
 We have a significant concentration in commercial real estate loans. If our regulators were to curtail our commercial real estate lending activities, our earnings, dividend paying capacity and/or ability to repurchase shares could be adversely affected. 
 In 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the Guidance ). The Guidance provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny when total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family property, non-owner occupied commercial real estate and construction loans, represent 300 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 553 of Bank total risk-based capital at June 30, 2023, however our commercial real estate loan portfolio increased by only 31 during the preceding 36 months.

 Income from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings. 
 A component of our business strategy is to sell a portion of residential mortgage loans originated into the secondary market, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. For the year ended June 30, 2023, gains attributable to the sale of residential mortgage loans totaled 760,000, or approximately 27.6 of our non-interest income, a decline of 1.7 million from 2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. If the residential mortgage loan demand decreases or we are unable to sell such loans for an adequate profit, then our non-interest income will likely decline which would adversely affect our earnings. 
 We may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our investment securities portfolio. 
 We review our securities portfolio at the end of each quarter to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of our investment securities has declined below its carrying value, we are required to assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more than likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we would be required to record an impairment charge. 
 We elected the practical expedient of zero loss estimates for securities issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. A possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could adversely impact the value of our investment securities portfolio. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 At June 30, 2023, we had investment securities with fair values of approximately 1.36 billion on which we had approximately 171.7 million in gross unrealized losses and 274,000 of gross unrealized gains. The valuation and liquidity of our securities could be adversely impacted by reduced market liquidity, increased normal bid-asked spreads and increased uncertainty of market participants, which could reduce the market value of our securities, including those with no apparent credit exposure. The valuation of our securities requires judgment and as market conditions change security values may also change. Significant negative changes to valuations could result in impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our investments in corporate and municipal debt securities, subordinated debt securities and collateralized loan obligations expose us to additional credit risks. 
 The composition and allocation of our investment portfolio has historically emphasized U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. agency debentures. While such assets remain a significant component of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2023, prior enhancements to our investment policies, strategies and infrastructure have enabled us to diversify the composition and allocation of our securities portfolio. Such diversification has included investing in corporate debt, municipal obligations, subordinated debt securities issued by financial institutions and collateralized loan obligations. With the exception of collateralized loan obligations, these securities are generally backed only by the credit of their issuers while investments in collateralized loan obligations generally rely on the structural characteristics of an individual tranche within a larger investment vehicle to protect the investor from credit losses arising from borrowers defaulting on the underlying securitized loans. 
 While we have invested primarily in investment grade securities, these securities are not backed by the federal government and expose us to a greater degree of credit risk than U.S. agency securities. Any decline in the credit quality of these securities exposes us to the risk that the market value of the securities could decrease which may require us to write down their value and could lead to a possible default in payment. 
 Source of Funds 
 Our reliance on wholesale funding could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. 
 Among other sources of funds, we rely on wholesale funding, including short- and long-term borrowings, brokered deposits and non-brokered deposits acquired through listing services, to provide funds with which to make loans, purchase investment securities and provide for other liquidity needs. On June 30, 2023, wholesale funding totaled 2.15 billion, or approximately 26.6 of total assets.

 In the future, this funding may not be readily replaced as it matures, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to maintain it. Not being able to maintain or replace those funds as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher interest rates to maintain or replace funding would adversely affect our net interest margin and operating results. 
 Public funds deposits are a notable source of funds for us and a reduced level of those deposits may hurt our profits and liquidity position. 
 Public funds deposits are a notable source of funds for our lending and investment activities. At June 30, 2023, 672.0 million, or 11.9 of our total deposits, consisted of public funds deposits from local government entities in the state of New Jersey, such as townships, counties and school districts. These deposits are collateralized by letters of credit from the FHLB or through the pledge of eligible investment securities. Given our reliance on these typically high-average balance public funds deposits as a source of funds, our inability to retain such funds could adversely affect our liquidity. Further, our public funds deposits are primarily floating rate interest-bearing demand deposit accounts and therefore their pricing is more sensitive to changes in interest rates. If we are forced to pay higher rates on our public funds accounts to retain those funds, or if we are unable to retain such funds and we are forced to rely on other sources of funds for our lending and investment activities, such as borrowings from the FHLB, the interest expense associated with these other funding sources may be higher than the rates we are currently paying on our public funds deposits, which would adversely affect our net interest income. 
 Information Security 
 Risks associated with system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could negatively affect our earnings. 
 Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our client relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the effect of system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, performance failures or other exceptions of our client-facing technologies could deter clients from using our products and services. 
 In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party service providers. If these service providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to timely and accurately process and account for transactions could be adversely affected. 
 The occurrence of any system failures, service interruptions or other performance exceptions could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings. 
 The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches. We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our clients' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption. 
 Our clients are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in clients' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses. The occurrence of a breach of security involving our clients' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 While our Board of Directors takes an active role in cybersecurity risk tolerance, we rely to a large degree on management and outside consultants in overseeing cybersecurity risk management. 
 Our Board of Directors takes an active role in the cybersecurity risk tolerance of the Company and all members receive cybersecurity training annually. The Board reviews the annual risk assessments and approves information technology policies, which include cybersecurity. Furthermore, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing all audit findings related to information technology general controls, internal and external vulnerability, and penetration testing. The Board receives an annual information security report and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee receives an annual presentation from our Information Security Officer as it relates to cybersecurity and related issues. We also engage outside consultants to support our cybersecurity efforts. However, our directors do not have significant experience in cybersecurity risk management outside of the Company and therefore, its ability to fulfill its oversight function remains dependent on the input it receives from management and outside consultants. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations. 
 The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described under the heading Item 1. Business Regulation. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further alter the regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and the manner in which companies within the industry conduct business. 
 In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Future changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies may occur over time through policy and personnel changes, which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry. These changes may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in tax laws and/or regulatory requirements could be enacted. These changes in the law may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. An increase in our corporate tax rate could have an unfavorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities. Similarly, the Bank s clients could experience varying effects from changes in tax laws and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole. In addition, changes to regulatory requirements could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. 
 Business Issues 
 We hold certain intangible assets, including goodwill, which could become impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings would decrease. 
 At June 30, 2023, we had approximately 213.4 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet comprising 210.9 million of goodwill and 2.5 million of core deposit intangibles. We are required to periodically test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels, but recognition of such an impairment loss could significantly restrict Kearny Bank s ability to make dividend payments to Kearny Financial and therefore adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.

 We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives, including stock repurchase plans, will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
 Our business plan calls for us to execute a variety of strategies to allocate and deploy any excess capital including, but not limited to, continued organic balance sheet growth and diversification, implementation of stock repurchase plans and payment of regular cash dividends. Additionally, we will carefully consider acquisition opportunities to further deploy capital when we expect such opportunities to significantly enhance long-term shareholder value. If we are unable to effectively and timely deploy capital through these strategies, it may constrain growth in earnings and return on equity and thereby diminish potential growth in stockholder value. 
 On August 1, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized a new stock repurchase plan to acquire up to 4,000,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. Repurchases are made at management s discretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company s financial performance. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. One such change is a 1 excise tax on stock repurchases, which increased the cost of stock repurchases and may impact our future decisions on how to return value to stockholders in the most efficient manner. 
 Our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the cost savings and benefits anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. There is risk that our acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully; being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition; or the overall performance of the combined entity. 
 Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause clients to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively. 
 Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks. 
 We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and client attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation. 
 Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. 
 Our risk management framework is designed to effectively manage and mitigate risk while minimizing exposure to potential losses. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.

 We could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls. 
 A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that clients, regulators and investors may have of us. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to continually strengthening our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and banking regulations. 
 The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business. 
 The successful execution of our business strategy is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel. Failure to do so could adversely affect our strategy, client relationships and internal operations.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 This discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp. s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and goodwill. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The determination of our allowance for credit losses on loans ACL is considered a critical accounting estimate by management because of the high degree of judgment involved in determining qualitative loss factors, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the forecasted economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded ACL. See Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the ACL. 
 Management believes the following information may enable investors to better understand the changes in our ACL. Our ACL totaled 48.7 million and 47.1 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 1.7 million increase in our ACL was primarily driven by our collectively evaluated loans. The quantitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on the national unemployment rate forecast, increased 8.5 million, which largely resulted from loan growth, slower prepayment speeds and a higher forecasted national unemployment rate. The qualitative component of our ACL, which is largely based on management s judgment of qualitative loss factors, decreased 6.5 million. 
 Our ACL totaled 48.7 million at June 30, 2023 and the amount allocated to our collectively evaluated multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans was 32.0 million, of which 23.3 million was attributable to qualitative loss factors. Changes in managements judgement of qualitative loss factors could result in a significant change to the ACL. As described in Note 1, qualitative loss factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts judgmentally determined by the relative risk to the most severe loss periods identified in the historical loan charge-offs of a peer group of similar-sized regional banks. At June 30, 2023, the most severe historical loss rate for multi-family and nonresidential mortgages loans was 1.72 . 
 Management performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of a change in a key input on our ACL. At June 30, 2023, if the four-quarter national unemployment rate forecast had been 9 rather than an average of approximately 4.0 , our ACL as a percent of total loans would have increased 33 basis points from 0.83 to 1.16 . This sensitivity analysis includes the impact to both the quantitative and qualitative components of our ACL. Changes in quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may not occur in the same direction or magnitude across all segments of our loan portfolio and deterioration in some quantitative inputs and qualitative loss factors may offset improvement in others. This sensitivity analysis does not represent a change to our expectations of the economic environment but provides a hypothetical result to assess the sensitivity of the ACL to a change in a key input. This sensitivity analysis does not incorporate changes to management s judgment of qualitative loss factors. 
 Our ACL on individually analyzed loans is determined on an individual basis using the present value of expected cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, as applicable. Our ACL on individually analyzed loans decreased 315,000 during the year ended June 30, 2023.

 Goodwill. We have goodwill of 210.9 million at June 30, 2023. Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 In assessing impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Due to a significant decline in bank stock prices, triggered by regional bank failures, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2023. The quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value, and impairment loss would be recorded. 
 The quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis income approach and estimates of selected market information market approaches ). The result of the income approach was weighted at 50 and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50 in determining the fair value of our single reporting unit. The fair value of our single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended June 30, 2023. Determining fair value of our single reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, and market estimates. In the future, changes in projected future cash flows, discount rate assumption, or market estimates could result in material goodwill impairment. To quantify the impact of a potential goodwill impairment charge at June 30, 2023, the impact of a five percent impairment charge on goodwill would result in a reduction in pre-tax income of approximately 10.5 million.

 Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 
 Executive Summary. Total assets increased by 344.9 million, or 4.5 , to 8.06 billion at June 30, 2023 from 7.72 billion at June 30, 2022. The increase primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. 
 Investment Securities. Investment securities available for sale decreased by 116.4 million to 1.23 billion at June 30, 2023 from 1.34 billion at June 30, 2022. This decrease was largely the result of principal repayments of 124.7 million, sales of 120.4 million and a 38.1 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of 156.1 million, partially offset by purchases of 166.5 million. 
 Investment securities held to maturity increased by 28.2 million to 146.5 million at June 30, 2023 from 118.3 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was largely the result of purchases of 40.4 million, partially offset by principal repayments of 12.1 million. 
 Additional information regarding investment securities at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Loans Held-for-Sale. Loans held-for-sale totaled 9.6 million at June 30, 2023 as compared to 28.9 million at June 30, 2022 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable. Loans held-for-sale consisted of residential mortgage loans of 9.6 million at June 30, 2023 as compared to residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans of 7.1 million and 21.7 million, respectively, at June 30, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we sold 103.8 million of residential mortgage loans, resulting in a net gain on sale of 760,000, and 25.3 million of commercial mortgage loans, resulting in a net loss on sale of 2.5 million.

 Net Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable increased by 409.9 million, or 7.6 , to 5.78 billion at June 30, 2023 from 5.37 billion at June 30, 2022. Detail regarding the change in the loan portfolio is presented below: 
 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Increase/ (Decrease) (In Thousands) Commercial loans: Multi-family mortgage 2,761,775 2,409,090 352,685 Nonresidential mortgage 968,574 1,019,838 (51,264) Commercial business 146,861 176,807 (29,946) Construction 226,609 140,131 86,478 Total commercial loans 4,103,819 3,745,866 357,953 One- to four-family residential mortgage 1,700,559 1,645,816 54,743 Consumer loans: Home equity loans 43,549 42,028 1,521 Other consumer 2,549 2,866 (317) Total consumer loans 46,098 44,894 1,204 Total loans 5,850,476 5,436,576 413,900 Unaccreted yield adjustments (21,055) (18,731) (2,324) Allowance for credit losses (48,734) (47,058) (1,676) Net loans receivable 5,780,687 5,370,787 409,900 
 Commercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2023 totaled 895.9 million, comprised of 716.4 million of commercial mortgage loan originations, 91.8 million of commercial business loan originations and construction loan disbursements of 87.7 million. 
 One- to four-family residential mortgage loan origination volume, excluding loans held-for-sale, totaled 197.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 and was supplemented with loan purchases totaling 656,000. Home equity loan and line of credit origination volume for the same period totaled 26.0 million. 
 Additional information about our loans at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Nonperforming Loans and TDRs. Nonperforming loans decreased by 27.7 million to 42.6 million, or 0.73 of total loans, at June 30, 2023 from 70.3 million, or 1.30 of total loans, at June 30, 2022. The decrease in nonperforming loans was largely attributable to a decrease of 15.4 million in nonperforming nonresidential mortgage loans and a decrease of 7.5 million in nonperforming multi-family mortgage loans. 
 TDRs are loans where we have modified the contractual terms of the loan as a result of the financial condition of the borrower. Subsequent to their modification, TDRs are placed on non-accrual until such time as satisfactory payment performance has been demonstrated, at which time the loan may be returned to accrual status. At June 30, 2023, we had accruing TDRs totaling 10.5 million, an increase of 1.8 million from 8.7 million at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, we had non-accrual TDRs totaling 6.9 million, a decrease of 6.6 million from 13.5 million at June 30, 2022. 
 Additional information about nonperforming loans and TDRs at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

 Allowance for Credit Losses. At June 30, 2023, the ACL totaled 48.7 million, or 0.83 of total loans, reflecting an increase of 1.7 million from 47.1 million, or 0.87 of total loans, at June 30, 2022. The increase was largely attributable to a provision for credit losses of 2.5 million, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the expected life of the loan portfolio. Partially offsetting the provision for credit losses were net charge-offs of 810,000, of which 396,000 had been individually reserved for within the ACL at June 30, 2022. 
 Additional information about the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes, OREO and other assets, increased by 73.6 million to 829.8 million at June 30, 2023 from 756.2 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in other assets largely reflected a 24.6 million increase in FHLB stock, a 23.8 million increase in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio and a 12.8 million increase in OREO. The increase in OREO was a result of our acquisition of a 13.0 million nonresidential real estate property through foreclosure. The remaining change generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items. 
 Deposits. Total deposits decreased by 233.1 million, or 4.0 , to 5.63 billion at June 30, 2023 from 5.86 billion at June 30, 2022. Included in total deposits are brokered and listing service time deposits of 640.5 million and 773.5 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table sets forth the distribution of, and changes in, deposits, by type, at the dates indicated: 
 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Increase/ (Decrease) (In Thousands) Non-interest-bearing deposits 609,999 653,899 (43,900) Interest-bearing deposits: Interest-bearing demand 2,252,912 2,265,597 (12,685) Savings 748,721 1,053,198 (304,477) Certificates of deposit 2,017,551 1,889,562 127,989 Interest-bearing deposits 5,019,184 5,208,357 (189,173) Total deposits 5,629,183 5,862,256 (233,073) 
 Uninsured deposits totaled 1.77 billion as of June 30, 2023 compared to 1.53 billion as of June 30, 2022. Excluding collateralized deposits of state and local governments, and deposits of the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary and holding company, uninsured deposits totaled 710.4 million, or 12.6 of total deposits, at June 30, 2023 compared to 792.1 million, or 13.5 of total deposits, at June 30, 2022. 
 Additional information about our deposits at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Borrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by 605.5 million, or 67.2 , to 1.51 billion at June 30, 2023 from 901.3 million at June 30, 2022 which included overnight borrowings totaling 225.0 million and 250.0 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a net increase in FHLB advances. 
 Additional information about our borrowings at June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased by 2.8 million to 59.5 million at June 30, 2023 from 62.3 million at June 30, 2022. The change in the balance of other liabilities generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within these line items. 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity decreased by 24.7 million to 869.3 million at June 30, 2023 from 894.0 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in stockholders equity during the year ended June 30, 2023 largely reflected dividends totaling 28.7 million and share repurchases totaling 27.4 million. In addition, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, was 13.7 million, which was driven by a decline in the fair value of our available for sale securities, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio. These items were partially offset by net income of 40.8 million.

 Book value per share increased by 0.18 to 13.20 at June 30, 2023 while tangible book value per share increased by 0.06 to 9.96 at June 30, 2023. 
 On August 1, 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors had authorized a new stock repurchase plan to repurchase up to 4,000,000 shares, and the completion of our previous stock repurchase plan, which authorized the repurchase of 7,602,021 shares. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 2,820,398 shares of common stock at a cost of 27.4 million, or 9.73 per share, including 2,495,253 shares, or 62.4 of the shares authorized for repurchase under the current repurchase program, at a cost of 23.8 million, or 9.54 per share. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 
 Net Income . Net income for the year ended June 30, 2023 was 40.8 million, or 0.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 39.6 from 67.5 million, or 0.95 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in net income reflected a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for credit losses and a decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest expense and a decrease in income tax expense. Net income for the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 was impacted by various non-recurring items, as described in further detail below. 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income decreased by 20.7 million to 175.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease between the comparative periods resulted from an increase of 88.2 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 67.5 million in interest income. Included in net interest income for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was purchase accounting accretion of 5.3 million and 9.0 million and loan prepayment penalty income of 895,000 and 5.4 million. 
 Net interest margin decreased 60 basis points to 2.34 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 2.94 for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease reflected increases in the cost and average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by increases in the yield on and average balance of interest-earning assets. The increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities and yield on interest-earning assets is the result of higher market interest rates that were caused by an increase in the federal funds target rate from 0 - 0.25 in March 2022 to 5.00 - 5.25 in May 2023.

 Details surrounding the composition of, and changes to, net interest income are presented in the table below which reflects the components of the average balance sheet and of net interest income for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the calculation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans has been fully reserved for and therefore not included in interest income. The yields and costs set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense and exclude the impact of prepayment penalties, which are recorded to non-interest income.

 Provision for Credit Losses . The provision for credit losses increased by 10.0 million to a provision for credit losses of 2.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to a reversal of credit losses of 7.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The provision for credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2023 was largely attributable to loan growth, partially offset by a reduction in the expected life of the loan portfolio. By comparison, the reversal of credit losses for the year ended June 30, 2022 was largely attributable to an improvement in our economic forecast, a reduction in the expected life of various segments of the loan portfolio and a net reduction in reserves on loans individually analyzed for impairment. 
 Additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses and the associated provision recognized during the year ended June 30, 2023 is presented under Item 1, Business on this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2023. 
 Non-Interest Income . Non-interest income decreased by 11.2 million to 2.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 Loss on sale and call of securities was 15.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 559,000 recorded during the earlier comparative period. The current year loss was the result of a previously announced wholesale restructuring that involved the sale of 120.4 million of available for sale securities. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested in higher yielding securities. 
 Loss on sale of loans was 1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to a gain on sale of loans of 2.5 million during the earlier comparative period. The current year included a loss of 2.5 million that resulted from the sale of a non-performing commercial mortgage loan held-for-sale. In addition, the decrease in gain on sale of loans reflected a decrease in the volume of loans sold between comparative periods. 
 Income from bank owned life insurance increased 2.5 million to 8.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase is the result of payouts on life insurances policies.

Table of Contents 

 Other non-interest income increased 4.7 million to 6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a non-recurring gain of 2.9 million from the sale of a former branch location and a 1.8 million increase in income from investment services. These increases were partially offset by 356,000 of non-recurring gains on asset disposals in the earlier comparative period. 
 The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest income between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. 
 Non-Interest Expense . Non-interest expense decreased by 2.0 million to 123.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by 675,000 to 75.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was largely due to lower incentive compensation, lower incentive payments tied to loan origination volume and lower expense from retirement plans. These decreases were partially offset by higher salary expense and non-recurring severance expense resulting from a reduction in headcount. 
 Net occupancy expense of premises decreased by 2.1 million to 12.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was largely due to expenses recognized in the prior period including 1.5 million of non-recurring expenses related to the consolidation of three retail branch locations and an office facility and 250,000 related to facility repairs made in connection with damage incurred during Tropical Storm Ida. The current year includes 250,000 of non-recurring occupancy expenses related to the consolidation of two retail branch locations. 
 Equipment and systems expense decreased by 1.3 million to 14.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was largely attributable to a prior period non-recurring expense of 800,000 from the early termination of a contract with a service provider. 
 FDIC insurance premiums increased 2.7 million to 5.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. This increase was largely driven by asset growth. 
 Director compensation decreased by 768,000 to 1.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. This decrease primarily reflected a decline in director-related stock-based compensation expense. 
 The remaining changes in the other components of non-interest expense between comparative periods generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes decreased by 13.2 million to 11.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 24.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in income tax expense reflected a lower level of pre-tax income as compared to the prior period. 
 Effective tax rates for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 22.1 and 26.9 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower taxable income, as well as non-taxable payouts on life insurance policies, noted above, during the year ended June 30, 2023. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 
 A comparison of our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on August 26, 2022.

 Liquidity and Commitments 
 Liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, cash flows from investment securities and loans receivable and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization and maturity of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and securities. 
 Liquidity, at June 30, 2023, included 70.5 million of short-term cash and equivalents and 1.23 billion of investment securities available for sale which can readily be sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we have the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB, FRB or via unsecured overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2023, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling 1.55 billion and 415.0 million from the FHLB and FRB, respectively, without pledging additional collateral. We had the ability to pledge additional securities to borrow an additional 477.0 million at June 30, 2023. As of that same date, we also had access to unsecured overnight borrowings with other financial institutions totaling 990.0 million, of which 100.0 million was outstanding. 
 Deposits decreased 233.1 million to 5.63 billion at June 30, 2023 from 5.86 billion at June 30, 2022. The decrease in deposit balances reflected a 189.2 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a 43.9 million decrease in non-interest-bearing deposits. Borrowings from the FHLB and other sources are generally available to supplement our liquidity position or to replace maturing deposits. As of June 30, 2023, our outstanding balance of FHLB advances, excluding fair value adjustments, totaled 1.28 billion. As of the same date, we had 125.0 million outstanding via our overnight line of credit with the FHLB. 
 The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our short-term borrowings at and for the periods shown:

 In addition to the loan commitments noted above, the pipeline of loans held for sale included 11.7 million of in process loans whose terms included interest rate locks to borrowers that were paired with a best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. 
 In addition to the commitments noted above, we are party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately 115,000 at June 30, 2023 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 At June 30, 2023, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled 251.2 million compared to 510.5 million at June 30, 2022. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2023, see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements.

 Impact of Inflation 
 The financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. 
 Our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. 
 The principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Management of Interest Rate Risk and Market Risk 
 The majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and as such, interest rate risk is a significant form of market risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates and arises from several risk factors including re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk. 
 We maintain an Asset/Liability Management ALM program in order to manage our interest rate risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through its Interest Rate Risk Management Committee, which has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO ), which is comprised of various members of the senior and executive management team. 
 The quantitative analysis that we conduct measures interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to earnings, movements in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve significantly influence the amount of net interest income NII that we recognize. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the spread between the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our projected NII over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into similar instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario. 
 With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity EVE to movements in interest rates. EVE represents the present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet instruments. EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology. The degree to which our EVE changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its base case measurement is a reflection of an institution s sensitivity to interest rate risk. 
 For both earnings and capital at risk our interest rate risk analysis calculates a base case scenario that assumes no change in interest rates. The model then measures changes throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. The relatively low level of interest rates prevalent at June 30, 2022 precluded the modeling of certain falling rate scenarios.

 The following tables present the results of our internal EVE and NII analyses as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively: 
 June 30, 2023 1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months Change in Interest Rates Amount of EVE Change in EVE Amount of NII Change in NII Amount of NII Change in NII (Dollars in Thousands) +300 bps 507,998 (32.36) 154,552 (5.26) 168,366 (3.87) +200 bps 571,129 (23.95) 156,274 (4.20) 167,683 (4.26) +100 bps 673,314 (10.35) 160,344 (1.71) 173,170 (1.13) 0 bps 751,040 163,132 175,143 -100 bps 799,675 6.48 163,455 0.20 173,319 (1.04) -200 bps 814,293 8.42 161,284 (1.13) 166,473 (4.95) -300 bps 849,208 13.07 158,526 (2.82) 156,507 (10.64) 
 June 30, 2022 1 to 12 Months 13 to 24 Months Change in Interest Rates Amount of EVE Change in EVE Amount of NII Change in NII Amount of NII Change in NII (Dollars in Thousands) +300 bps 1,089,795 (15.37) 178,865 (13.62) 214,839 (1.68) +200 bps 1,156,219 (10.21) 187,601 (9.40) 215,528 (1.36) +100 bps 1,239,935 (3.71) 198,126 (4.32) 219,594 0.50 0 bps 1,287,700 207,069 218,501 -100 bps 1,272,203 (1.20) 205,241 (0.88) 204,568 (6.38) 
 There are numerous internal and external factors that may contribute to changes in our EVE and its sensitivity. Changes in the composition and allocation of our balance sheet, or utilization of off-balance sheet instruments such as derivatives, can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also alter the projected cash flows of our interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values thereof. 
 Notwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and NII-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the analyses set forth above. Additionally, an increase in credit risk may result as the ability of borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.

 Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The management of Kearny Financial Corp. and Subsidiaries (collectively the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published consolidated financial statements. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Explanatory Paragraph Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective July 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASC 326. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Qualitative Factors - As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accounts for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. ASC 326 requires the measurement of expected lifetime credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost at the reporting date. As of June 30, 2023, the balance of the allowance for credit losses on loans was 48.7 million. 
 Management employs a process and methodology to estimate the allowance for credit losses ACL on loans that evaluates both quantitative and qualitative factors. The methodology for evaluating quantitative factors involves pooling loans into portfolio segments for loans that share similar risk characteristics. Pooled loan portfolio segments include multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, commercial business, construction, one-to-four family residential mortgage, home equity and consumer loans. 
 For pooled loans, the Company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow DCF methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The DCF methodology combines the probability of default, the loss given default, remaining life of the loan and prepayment and curtailment speed assumptions to estimate a reserve for each loan. The loss rates are adjusted by current and forecasted macroeconomic assumptions and return to the mean after the forecasted periods. These quantitative factors are supplemented by qualitative factors reflecting management s view of how losses may vary from those represented by quantitative loss rates. Qualitative factors are applied to each portfolio segment with the amounts determined by correlation of credit stress to the maximum loss factors of a peer group s historical charge-offs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the Company s financial results. 
 We identified auditing the qualitative component of the ACL on pooled loans in the multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, and one-to-four family residential mortgage loan segments as a critical audit matter because the methodology to determine the estimate of credit losses uses subjective judgments by management and is subject to material variability. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the qualitative factors on the multi-family, nonresidential mortgage, and one-to-four family residential mortgage loan segments involved a high degree of auditor judgment and required significant effort, including the need to involve more experienced audit personnel including the use of internal specialists. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Testing the effectiveness of controls over the evaluation of the ACL on pooled loans, including controls addressing: 
 Methodology and accounting policies. 
 Data inputs, judgments and calculations used to determine the qualitative factors. 
 Information technology general controls and application controls. 
 Management s review of the qualitative factors.

 Substantively testing management s process, including evaluating their judgments and assumptions, for developing the ACL on loans collectively evaluated for impairment, which included: 
 Evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company s methodology and accounting policies involved in the application of ASC 326. 
 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. 
 Testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation including utilizing internal specialists to assist in testing the accuracy of the underlying peer data used to develop the maximum loss factors. 
 Evaluation of the reasonableness of management s judgments related to qualitative factors to determine if they are calculated to conform with management s policies and were consistently applied period over period. Our evaluation considered evidence from internal and external sources and loan portfolio composition and performance. 
 Goodwill Impairment - As described in Notes 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 210.9 million as of June 30, 2023, which is allocated to the Company s single reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Company s single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis income approach and estimates of selected market information market approaches ). The result of the income approach was weighted at 50 and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50 in determining the fair value of the Company s single reporting unit. The fair value of the Company s single reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charges were recorded as of June 30, 2023. The goodwill impairment assessment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of management judgment. 
 We identified the goodwill impairment assessment of the Company as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for this determination were the degree of auditor judgment in performing procedures over the key assumptions, which include discount rate, cost savings rate, expected future cash flows, and weighting allocation to valuation methodologies. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Testing the effectiveness of controls over the valuation methodologies, assumptions and data used to estimate the fair value of the Company, including controls addressing: 
 Management s review of the reasonableness and accuracy of the Company s expected future cash flows used in the income approach. 
 Management s evaluation of assumptions and inputs used, including discount rate, cost savings rate, comparable companies data, and allocated weightings incorporated into the methodologies used to determine fair value. 
 Completeness and accuracy of key financial data used in the assessment. 
 Substantively testing management s estimate, for estimating the fair value of the Company, which included: 
 Testing of key financial data for completeness and accuracy. 
 Evaluation of management s ability to reasonably forecast cash flows. 
 Utilization of an internal specialist to evaluate appropriateness of valuation methodologies, the discount rate assumption, cost savings rate, comparable companies data, and overall reasonableness of the fair value. 
 Evaluation of management s weighting allocation to each valuation methodology.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 For the year ended June 30, 2023, the annual quantitative assessment of goodwill for our single reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis income approach and estimates of selected market information market approaches ). The income approach measures the fair value of an interest in a business by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. The market approaches take into consideration fair values of comparable companies operating in similar lines of business that are potentially subject to similar economic and environmental factors and could be considered reasonable investment alternatives. The result of the income approach was weighted at 50 and the results of the market approaches comprised the remaining 50 in determining the fair value of our single reporting unit. The results of the annual quantitative impairment analysis indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for our single reporting unit. 
 impairment charges were required to be recorded in the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021. If an impairment loss is determined to exist in the future, such loss will be reflected as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the impairment loss is determined. 
 The balance of other intangible assets at June 30, 2023 and 2022 totaled million and million, respectively, representing the remaining unamortized balance of the core deposit intangibles ascribed to the value of deposits acquired by the Bank through the acquisition of Clifton Bancorp Inc. in April 2018 and MSB Financial Corp. in July 2020.

 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Management engaged a third-party specialist to develop the fair value estimate of certain MSB s assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at their fair values as of July 10, 2020 based on management s best estimate using the information available as of the merger date. The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in the recognition of bargain purchase gain of million and a core deposit intangible of .

 Available for sale securities are evaluated to determine if a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or from other factors. An impairment related to credit factors would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the amount by which the security s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. An impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses shall be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income if management intends to sell, or may be required to sell, the securities before they recover in value. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments and none of these securities were past due or were placed in nonaccrual status at June 30, 2023. Management believes that the unrealized losses on these securities are a function of changes in market interest rates and credit spreads, not changes in credit quality. allowance for credit losses was recorded at June 30, 2023 on available for sale securities. 
 The sale of available for sale securities during the year ended June 30, 2023 was part of a wholesale restructuring and the proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding securities. The Company was not required to sell these securities. 
 At June 30, 2023, the held to maturity securities portfolio consisted of agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions. The mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government agencies and are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. The obligations of state and political subdivisions in the portfolio are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The Company regularly monitors the obligations of state and political subdivisions sector of the market and reviews collectability including such factors as the financial condition of the issuers as well as credit ratings in effect as of the reporting period. allowance for credit losses was recorded at June 30, 2023 on held to maturity securities.

 Nonperforming Loans 
 Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractual payments become 90 or more days past due or when the Company does not expect to receive all P I payment owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, regardless of past due status. Loans that become 90 days past due, but are well secured and in the process of collection, may remain on accrual status. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all payments due are brought current and the Company expects to receive all remaining P I payments owed substantially in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Payments received in cash on nonaccrual loans, including both the principal and interest portions of those payments, are generally applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. The Company did t recognize interest income on non-accrual loans during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 On a case-by-case basis, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to assist a borrower who may be experiencing financial difficulty, as well as to preserve the Company s position in the loan. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a TDR. The Company had TDRs totaling million and million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The allowance for credit losses associated with the TDRs presented in the tables below totaled and as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Loan modifications generally involve a reduction in interest rates and/or extension of maturity dates and also may include step up interest rates in their modified terms which will impact their weighted average yield in the future. The loans which qualified as TDRs during the year ended June 30, 2023, capitalized prior past due amounts, reduced the interest rate or modified the repayment terms. 
 Individually Analyzed Loans 
 Individually analyzed loans include loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. TDRs will generally be evaluated for individual impairment, however, after a period of sustained repayment performance which permits the credit to be returned to accrual status, a TDR would generally be removed from individual impairment analysis and returned to its corresponding pool. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of individually analyzed loans, including loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality that were individually analyzed, totaled million, of which million were considered collateral dependent. 
 For collateral dependent loans where management has determined that foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the allowance for credit losses is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. See Note 18 for additional disclosure regarding fair value of individually analyzed collateral dependent loans.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 Pass Loans that are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 
 Special Mention Loans which do not currently expose the Company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification but have some credit deficiencies or other potential weaknesses. 
 Substandard Loans which are inadequately protected by the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful Loans which have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. 
 Loss Loans which considered uncollectible or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.

 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company uses derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and an interest rate floor as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate products are designated as cash flow hedges. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had a total of interest rate swaps and caps with a total notional amount of billion hedging specific wholesale funding positions and interest rate floor with a notional amount of million hedging floating-rate available for sale securities. 
 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
 For cash flow hedges on the Company's wholesale funding positions, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s hedged variable rate wholesale funding positions. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company reclassified million as a reduction in interest expense. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that million will be reclassified as a reduction in interest expense. 
 For cash flow hedges on the Company s assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income as interest payments are received on the Company s hedged variable rate assets. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company did t reclassify any amount to interest income. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that will be reclassified as a reduction in interest income.

 Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Such derivatives are used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of fixed rate assets. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million hedging fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. 
 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. Gain on hedges recorded in interest income on loans

 percent of quarterly net income of the Bank. 
 During the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company, in conjunction with quarterly capital distributions, as discussed above, totaled million, million and million, respectively. 
 The Bank and the Company are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank and consolidated Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their respective assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s and consolidated Company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. 
 The minimum capital level requirements applicable to both the Bank and the consolidated Company include: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 ; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 for all institutions. The Bank and the consolidated Company are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the regulatory minimum capital ratios which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0 ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 ; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5 . An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.

 The effective income tax rate represents total income tax expense divided by income before income taxes. Retained earnings at June 30, 2023, includes approximately million of bad debt allowance , pursuant to the IRC, for which income taxes have not been provided. If such amount is used for purposes other than to absorb bad debts, including distributions in liquidation, it will be subject to income tax at the then current rate. 
 A tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation process, if any. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management s judgment. 
 Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryover period. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. Based on its assessments as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized. 
 During the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company reversed a valuation allowance totaling which was associated with the realization of a capital loss carryforward.

 Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis: 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 Individually Analyzed Collateral Dependent Loans: 
 The fair value of collateral dependent loans that are individually analyzed is determined based upon the appraised fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. Such collateral primarily consists of real estate and, to a lesser extent, other business assets. Management may also adjust appraised values to reflect estimated changes in market values or apply other adjustments to appraised values resulting from its knowledge of the collateral. Internal valuations may be utilized to determine the fair value of other business assets. For non-collateral-dependent loans, management estimates fair value using discounted cash flows based on inputs that are largely unobservable and instead reflect management s own estimates of the assumptions as a market participant would in pricing such loans. Individually analyzed collateral dependent loans are considered a Level 3 valuation by the Company. 
 Other Real Estate Owned 
 Other real estate owned is recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for credit losses. If further declines in the estimated fair value of the asset occur, a write-down is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions.

 (1) The fair value basis of collateral dependent loans is generally determined based on an independent appraisal of the fair value of a loan s underlying collateral. 
 (2) The fair value basis of collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned is adjusted to reflect management estimates of selling costs including, but not limited to, real estate brokerage commissions and title transfer fees. 
 (3) The fair value basis of other real estate owned is generally determined based upon the lower of an independent appraisal of the property s fair value or the applicable listing price or contracted sales price. 
 At June 30, 2023, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balance totaling million and valuation allowance of million reflecting an aggregate fair value of million. By comparison, at June 30, 2022, collateral dependent loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balance totaling million and valuation allowances of million reflecting an aggregate fair value of million.

 Commitments. The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans held in portfolio or loans held for sale is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, including those relating to loans held for sale that are considered derivative instruments for financial statement reporting purposes, the fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure. 
 Limitations. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no fair value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
 The fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes and insurance. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates. 
 Finally, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.
