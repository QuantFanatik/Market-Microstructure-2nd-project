PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

(a) Business Development 

 C2 Blockchain, Inc. was incorporated on June 30, 2021 in the State of Nevada. 

 On June 30, 2021, Levi Jacobson was appointed Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of C2 Blockchain, Inc. 

 On
March 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Agreement and Plan of Merger , whereas it agreed to, and subsequently participated
in, a Nevada holding company reorganization pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS 92A.200, NRS 92A.230 and NRS 92A.250 Reorganization ).
The constituent corporations in the Reorganization were American Estate Management Company AEMC or Predecessor ),
C2 Blockchain, Inc. Successor or CBLO ), and AEMC Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub ). Our director
is, and was, the sole director/officer of each constituent corporation in the Reorganization. 

C2
Blockchain, Inc. issued 1,000 common shares of its common stock to Predecessor and Merger Sub issued 1,000 shares of its common stock
to C2 Blockchain, Inc. immediately prior to the Reorganization. As such, immediately prior to the merger, C2 Blockchain, Inc. became a
wholly owned direct subsidiary of American Estate Management Company and Merger Sub became a wholly owned and direct subsidiary of C2
Blockchain, Inc. 

On
March 31, 2022 , Merger Sub filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. The merger became
effective on April 1, 2022 at 4:00 PM PST Effective Time ). At the Effective Time, Predecessor was merged with and into
Merger Sub (the Merger), and Predecessor became the surviving corporation. Each share of Predecessor common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of C2 Blockchain, Inc. s Successors common stock. 

On
May 23, 2022, C2 Blockchain, Inc., as successor issuer to American Estate Management Company began a quoted market in its common
stock which was the market effective date for our corporate action. 

The
Company believes that the Reorganization, deemed effective on April 1, 2022, was not a transaction of the type described in subparagraph
(a) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 and the consummation of the Reorganization will not be deemed to involve an offer ,
 offer to sell , offer for sale or sale within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act
of 1933. The Reorganization was consummated without the vote or consent of the Company s stockholders. In addition, the provisions
of NRS 92A.180 did not provide a stockholder of the Company with appraisal rights in connection with the Reorganization. The Company believes
that in the absence of any right of any of the Company s stockholders to vote with respect to the Reorganization or to insist that
their shares be purchased for fair value, the Reorganization could not be deemed to involve an offer offer to sell 
or sale within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

On
April 1, 2022, after the completion of the Holding Company Reorganization, we cancelled all of the stock we held in AEMC resulting in
AEMC as a stand-alone company. Pursuant to the holding company merger agreement and effects of merger, all of the assets and liabilities,
if any, remain with AEMC after the Reorganization. Levi Jacobson, the Director of AEMC, did not discover any assets of AEMC from the time
he was appointed Director until the completion of the Reorganization and subsequent separation of AEMC as a stand-alone company. 

Given
that the former business plan and objectives of AEMC and the present day business plan and objectives of CBLO substantially differ from
one another, we conducted the corporate separation with AEMC immediately after the effective time of the Reorganization in order to avoid
any shareholder confusion. The former business plan of AEMC under the leadership of its former directors, does not, in any way, represent
the current day business plan of CBLO. The result of corporate separation ameliorated shareholder confusion about our identity
and/or corporate objectives. Furthermore, we wanted to continue trading in the OTC MarketPlace. 

On April 1, 2022, the Company transmuted its business plan from that of
a blank check shell company to a business combination related shell company with a holding company formation pursuant to a reorganization
with American Estate Management Company. 

The
corporate actions taken by the Company, including, but not limited to, the corporate structuring of the transactions, was deemed, in the
discretion of our sole director, to be for the benefit of the corporation and its shareholders. Former shareholders of AEMC are now the
shareholders of CBLO. Each and every shareholder of AEMC became a shareholder of CBLO with each share of capital stock of AEMC held by
former AEMC shareholder becoming an equivalent amount of capital stock held in CBLO. The former shareholders of AEMC now have the opportunity
to benefit under our business plan and we have the opportunity to grow organically from our shareholder base and new leadership under
our sole director. 

FINRA
completed its review of our corporate action pursuant to our Reorganization. On April 26, 2022, CBLO was given a CUSIP number by CUSIP
Global Services of 12675R 109. The announcement of our Predecessor s corporate action was posted on the FINRA daily list on May
20, 2022. The Market Effective date was May 23, 2022. 

Our
Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc s Pink Open Market under the symbol CBLO . 

After completion of the Holding Company Reorganization and separation
of AEMC as a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company reverted back to a blank check shell company. 

Currently, we no longer believe we are deemed to be a blank check
shell company, but rather a shell company as we have a bona fide business plan at this time. The Company s business plan is to
concentrate on cryptocurrency related investments and development opportunities including but not limited to cryptocurrency mining, primarily
for Bitcoin, for our own account, investments in private and/or public entities, joint ventures and acquisitions of blockchain related
companies. We have not commenced our planned principal operations. 

Currently,
Mendel Holdings, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, owned and controlled by Levi Jacobson, our sole director is our controlling
shareholder, owning 200,000,000 shares of our common stock representing approximately 78.76 voting control.

At this time our office space is provided to us rent free by our director. Our office space is located at 123 SE 3RD Ave, #130, Miami,
FL 33131. 

The Company has elected June 30th as its fiscal
year end. 

 At this time we have no employees and we
have no intellectual property. 

 (b) Business Summary 

We have not yet commenced any material operations. The Company
plans to build a 14 MW Bitcoin mining facility in Georgia U.S. specifically designed for hosting cryptocurrency mining equipment and
mining Bitcoin for our own account. Cryptocurrency mining (e.g. bitcoin mining) entails
running ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) servers or other specialized servers which solve a set of prescribed complex
mathematical calculations in order to add a block to a blockchain and thereby confirm digital asset transactions. A party which is
successful in adding a block to the blockchain is awarded a fixed number of digital assets in return. 

At this time, we own no real estate. Since our inception, June 30,
2021, we have not generated any revenues. 

In order to implement our plan of operations for the next
twelve-month period, we require a minimum of 200,000 in funding. At present, we plan to to acquire the aforementioned funding from
the sale of our common stock pursuant to a Tier II Regulation A Offering we seek to conduct in the near future. At present, the
Offering Statement pursuant to the Tier II Regulation Offering remains in review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is
not yet qualified. The Offering Circular and related documentation was filed on July 5, 2023. At this time, we cannot accurately
forecast when the Offering may be qualified and or subsequently conducted. 

The number of computers that we may purchase or lease for
mining bitcoin will depend on how quickly we are able to raise funds through the aforementioned Offering. We expect the proceeds
from the Offering will be sufficient for us to implement our business plan and that no additional funding will be needed to
implement our business plan, however there is no guarantee that this may be the case. We may be unsuccessful in raising any capital
from the Offering, and thus we may need to seek out alternate sources of financing. The scalability of our business plan also
depends entirely on our ability to secure funds for future operations. 

Our plan of operations for the next twelve (12) months is as follows: 

We are seeking up to a maximum of 60,000,000 in
funding from our pending Regulation A Offering to jumpstart our cryptocurrency mining operation including the purchase of ASIC
computers, land, and construction of a warehouse to host our mining operation. The following plan for the next 12 months assumes
that we receive 60,000,000. As mentioned, we believe a minimum of 200,000 is needed to commence material operations, albeit on a
smaller scale than what may be proposed below. There is a possibility that we do not obtain the necessary funding to carry out our
business plan. If this is to occur we may need to reconsider the feasibility of our business plan, or reconsider how
we allocate funds available to us. 

The amount we may spend on any of the various endeavors
below is subject to change and depends entirely on our future financial condition of the Company.

The amounts that we actually spend for any
specific purpose may vary significantly, and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the amount of money
that we actually receive from our pending Regulation A Offering, the pace of progress of our development efforts, actual needs with
respect to product testing, research and development, market conditions, and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies, as
well as any legal or regulatory changes which may ensue. You will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the proceeds of any sale of our common stock. 

If management is unable to implement our proposed
business plan or employ alternative financing strategies, it does not presently have any alternative proposals. In that event, investors
should anticipate that their investment may be lost and there may be no ability to profit from this investment. 

We cannot assure you that our planned mining operation
for bitcoin or any other digital coin will ever happen or that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that
we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to
severely curtail, or even to cease our operations.

We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue
to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:

Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal
control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls
and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment
on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. 

As an emerging growth company, we are also exempt from Section 14A (a)
and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. 

We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with
new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a
result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates,

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. 

As a smaller reporting company , we
are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

We have not yet commenced any material operations. The Company
plans to build a 14 MW Bitcoin mining facility in Georgia U.S. specifically designed for hosting cryptocurrency mining equipment and
mining Bitcoin for our own account. Cryptocurrency mining (e.g. bitcoin mining) entails
running ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) servers or other specialized servers which solve a set of prescribed complex
mathematical calculations in order to add a block to a blockchain and thereby confirm digital asset transactions. A party which is
successful in adding a block to the blockchain is awarded a fixed number of digital assets in return. 

At this time, we own no real estate. Since our inception, June 30,
2021, we have not generated any revenues. 

In order to implement our plan of operations for the next
twelve-month period, we require a minimum of 200,000 in funding. At present, we plan to to acquire the aforementioned funding from
the sale of our common stock pursuant to a Tier II Regulation A Offering we seek to conduct in the near future. At present, the
Offering Statement pursuant to the Tier II Regulation Offering remains in review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is
not yet qualified. The Offering Circular and related documentation was filed on July 5, 2023. At this time, we cannot accurately
forecast when the Offering may be qualified and or subsequently conducted. 

The number of computers that we may purchase or lease for mining
bitcoin will depend on how quickly we are able to raise funds through the aforementioned Offering and the amounts that we are ultimately
able to raise. We expect the proceeds from the Offering will be sufficient for us to implement our business plan and that no additional
funding will be needed to implement our business plan, however there is no guarantee that this may be the case. We may be unsuccessful
in raising any capital from the Offering, and thus we may need to seek out alternate sources of financing. The scalability of our business
plan also depends entirely on our ability to secure funds for future operations and the amount of funds at our disposal. At this time
we do not have the needed funding to implement our business plan in any capacity. 

Net
Loss 

Our
net income/loss for the year ended June 30, 2023 was (18,507) and was attributed to general and administrative expenses. 

Our
net income/loss for the year ended June 30, 2022 was (8,407) and was attributed to general and administrative expenses.

Liquidity 

We
have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm 

 To the stockholders and the board of directors
of C2 Blockchain, Inc. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of C2 Blockchain, Inc. as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30,
2023 and June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. 

 Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company
has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, 
as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, which at this time consists
solely of our officer and director, Levi Jacobson. 

As of June 30, 2023, the end of the year covered
by this Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of Mr. Jacobson, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Mr. Jacobson concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the year covered by this Report due to material weaknesses identified below. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control
over financial reporting is a process, including policies and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). A system
of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Based on our evaluation under the framework in COSO,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of June 30, 2023 based on such criteria.
Deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affect our internal controls
and that may be considered material weaknesses. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result of the determination that there was a lack of resources to provide segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives, the lack of a formal audit committee, and the lack of a formal review process that includes
multiple levels of review over financial disclosure and reporting processes, management has determined that material weaknesses existed
as of June 30, 2023. 

The weaknesses and the related risks are not uncommon
in a company of our size because of the limitations in the size and number of our staff. To address these material weaknesses, and subject
to the receipt of additional financing or cash flows, we intend to undertake remediation measures to address the material weaknesses described
in this Report, including implementing procedures pursuant to which we can ensure segregation of duties and hire additional resources
to ensure appropriate review and oversight. 

A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met under all potential conditions,
regardless of how remote, and may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a
simple error or mistake. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. 

Auditor s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

This Report does not include an attestation report
of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was
not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide
only management s report in this Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have occurred during
the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Committees of the Board 

We currently do not have nominating, compensation, or
audit committees, or committees performing similar functions, nor do we have a written nominating, compensation, or audit committee charter.
Our board of director(s) believes that it is not necessary to have such committees given our current size and the limited scope of our
business. Currently, our board of director(s) is performing the functions of such committees. 

In lieu of an Audit Committee, our board of director(s)
is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results, and
effectiveness of the annual audit of our financial statements and other services provided by our independent registered public accounting
firm. Our board of director(s), our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, all of whom are Levi Jacobson, review our
internal accounting controls, practices, and policies. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

Our board of director(s) has determined that we do
not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation
S-K . We believe that given our current size and the limited scope of our business, retaining an independent director who would qualify
as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome. We will consider establishing an Audit Committee, and identifying
an individual to serve as an independent director and as the audit committee financial expert when so required. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

None of our executive officers and directors, of which
we have one, have been involved in or a party to any of the following events or actions during the past ten years: 

1. 
 Any petition under the federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency laws filed by or against, or an appointment of a receiver, fiscal agent, or similar officer by a court for the business or property of such person, a partnership in which such person was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which such person was an executive officer either at or within two years prior to the time of such filing; 
 
 2. 
 Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 
 
 3. 
 Being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, such person from, or otherwise limiting, the following activities: (i) acting as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, floor broker, leverage transaction merchant, any other person regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or an associated person of any of the foregoing, or as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director, or employee of any investment company, bank, savings and loan association, or insurance company, or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with such activity; (ii) engaging in any type of business practice; or (iii) engaging in any activity in connection with the purchase or sale of any security or commodity or in connection with any violation of federal or state securities laws or federal commodities laws; 
 
 4. 
 Being the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any federal or state authority barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for more than 60 days the right of such person to engage in any activity described in paragraph (3)(i) above, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; 
 
 5. 
 Being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action) or the SEC to have violated a Federal or State securities law, and the judgment has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Being found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Being the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of :(i) any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; (ii) any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or (iii) any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Being the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. We only
have one employee, our sole officer and director, Levi Jacobson. In the event we commence operations, or the number of employees, number
of officers, and/or number of directors increases in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Nomination of Directors 

As of September 18, 2023, we had not effected any material
changes to the procedures by which our stockholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. We do not have any defined policy
or procedural requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. Our board of directors believes that,
given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations
develop to a more advanced level. We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to our board
of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our board of directors will assess all
candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A stockholder who wishes to communicate with our board
of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to the Company with the address appearing on the first page of this Report. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s
executive officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company s equity
securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company s common stock.
 Such officers, directors, and persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
that they file with the SEC. 

Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms
that were received by the Company, the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner
during the year ended June 30, 2023. 

Family Relationships 

There are no family relationships among our directors
or executive officers. We have only one officer and director at this time. 

Arrangements 

There are no arrangements or understandings between
an executive officer or director and any other person pursuant to which he was selected as an executive officer or director.
