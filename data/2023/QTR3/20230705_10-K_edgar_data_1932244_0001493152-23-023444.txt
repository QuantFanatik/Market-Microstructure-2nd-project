 BUSINESS 

Lever
Global Corporation (the Company, we, our, or us was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware on March 24, 2022. We are a fintech-driven consumer liabilities and debt management company. Our mission is
to empower subscribers to use our App to become financially independent by managing all of their liabilities and debt obligations in
one place. Mr. McKendrick is the Company s Founder, CEO, and Director and has started several fintech companies focusing on credit
and debt management for consumers and businesses since 2015. The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Lever Technology, Inc. Lever
Technology ), a California corporation. There are no operating activities for Lever Technology. 

The
Company had a soft launch of the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on the iOS App Store. Currently, the App allows the subscribers
to analyze their existing student loans and recommend programs the US Department of Education offers after the initial
assessment and processes enrollments into these programs. The App provides a list of qualified federal programs. The subscribers can
digitally enroll in these programs by uploading or self-declaring their W-2, wage, or tax statements through the App. If subscribers
are accepted for a federal program, the App manages their annual certifications for a monthly subscription fee. The average life of a
loan is twenty-one years. The Company has partnered with Array US, Inc. to give subscribers personalized credit and financial data through
the App, allowing them to understand their borrowing capacity better. The subscribers can also use the information to manage their credit
scores. 

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company added a round-up option, allowing subscribers to link their bank account and student loan
to the App and select to pay a few cents per transaction towards the principal of their student loan. The App will have a feature showing
the subscriber how the extra payments towards the loan will result in interest savings and reduce the loan term. 

In
fiscal 2023, the Company intends to offer its subscribers the tools in the App to directly negotiate and refinance their outstanding
credit card and auto loans with their lenders. The Company plans to connect several credit card companies and auto loan providers to
the App through API. As well as provide more ways to save, spend and invest through the development, acquisition, and key hires across
these technologies. The Company also plans to launch the App officially in the App Store and Play Store in the fiscal 2023. There is
no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans. 

We
are a development stage entity devoting all of its efforts to substantially establishing our flagship product, the Lever App App ).
The App s official launch is expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company had a soft launch of the App in the third
quarter of fiscal 2022; as a result, we have generated 16,878 for the three months ending December 31, 2022. 

The
App allows everyday people to directly negotiate, enroll, repay, and settle student loans for the US market without the complexity and
confusion of the fine print. The App helps subscribers with debt management - negotiation, repayment, and settlement. We are committed
to providing our subscribers impartial guidance in their journey toward financial independence. The App will be available on the Play
Store (Android) and App Store (iOS) under Lever App (the App as its brand name for a subscription-based fee billed monthly
or annually. 

4 

The
App will help the subscriber manage and resolve liabilities such as credit cards, student loans, and other types of consumer debts through
continued education and recommendations on how and when to refinance the student loan with the Department of Education, federal student
loan prequalification and enrollment, access credit scores, and other features that enable subscribers to manage their debt obligations
smartly, intuitively, and cost-effectively. The Company initially intends to target student debt holders in the United States as its
primary customer base. The Company believes that manually managing liabilities is complex and time-consuming, which involves actively
monitoring personal finances, estimating payments, negotiating with lenders, and finding the proper federal and state grants and loan
arrangements. It is difficult to maintain and monitor these loan terms with annual renewals that can last up to twenty-one (21) years
on average. 

The
Company believes the student loan borrower will benefit from the App. Our Application Program Interface (APIs) and artificial intelligence
(AI) driven programming connect them to the right and relevant federal loan programs with the most favorable terms qualifying
amount and rate, enrolling, and saving with a few clicks. The Lever App further informs the subscribers when and how to refinance their
student loans. 

Based
on the inputs the subscriber provides, the Lever App provides visual guidelines on how the subscriber s budget and spending suit
their current and future liabilities, including their student loan repayments, and provides a smarter way to repay their debts through
features like payment roundups and extra repayment recommendations, to help a subscriber pay off the liabilities smarter, without affecting
their existing spending habits. 

 The
Lever App provides subscribers instant matches through Student Aid, the largest provider of financial aid for college in the United States,
and other Federal student aid programs. The subscriber can access the complex world of student debt management in an easy four-step process
through the Lever App, which includes: 

Basic
 subscriber information per KYC requirements, 

The
 subscriber links one or multiple loans in real-time, also known as Enrollment, 

The
 software matches with up to three (3) options to manage loans (deferment or forbearance or reduced payments, etc.), and 

The
 subscriber picks the best option to connect to the best United States Government aid program to complete the application. 

Once
subscribers sync their respective liabilities and loans with the Lever App, the software automates with a data-driven algorithm to match
users with better ways to repay debts, such as providing automation for snowball or avalanche plans and extra repayment recommendations
for managing liabilities. The App also includes credit score insights and payment round-up technology using open banking protocols that
help and recommend that loan borrowers contribute micro amounts towards their loan principal, saving on years of interest and reaching
financial independence faster and better with the App.

Business
Strategy 

Our
experienced Management and in-house software development team have carefully designed various B2C debt management solutions to meet the
needs of borrowers in the United States and globally. We intend to grow our core business, increase market share, and improve profitability
principally by deploying the following growth strategies: 

Completed
 version 1 of the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with the soft launch, and launch the App officially to the public in the
 third quarter of fiscal 2023; 

Ramp
 up subscriber acquisition through our digital and traditional marketing strategies; 

Continue
 to enhance and promote our core proprietary liabilities and debt management app and introduce other innovative repayments, finance,
 and spending features for United States consumers; 

Future
 growth will depend on the timely development and successful distribution of the Lever App by signing enterprise and employer deals
 in the United States; 

Increase
 our software development capabilities to develop disruptive and next-generation machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven
 technologies to grow and retain subscriber base; 

Grow
 subscriber base through accretive acquisitions, opportunistic investments, and beneficial partnerships; and; 

Recognize
 and enter high-growth markets to expand our services to meet the demand for other financial solutions, including but not limited
 to auto-save and auto loan repayment from day-to-day debit card usage and investments such as IRAs and 401Ks.

Marketing
and Sales 

The
Company aims to be flexible and responsive to its sales and marketing strategies to provide an omnichannel customer experience. Therefore,
our primary focus is on different subscriber acquisition channels to expand our paid customer base. The Company is actively integrating
digital and traditional marketing channels effectively, as we believe these are scalable channels and that one-size-fits-most customers
no longer work. Our marketing strategy identifies and targets student borrowers who are high-value/high-potential subscribers. We have
found that these customers are often more receptive to a digital marketing strategy that includes SEO marketing, an intuitive website
experience, targeted emails/ content, educational blogs, and active social media engagement involving celebrities and influencers. For
traditional marketing, such as conferences, trade shows, expos, media events, and direct meetings, the senior Management in person provides
presentations, gives media interviews, and engages potential subscribers at events. 

We
have designed our marketing and sales strategies to drive prospective subscribers to the Play Store and App Store, where they can download
our App. 

To
spread the word, the Company has engaged celebrities and influencers, such as Austin Reaves (Age 23), to promote and endorse Company s
products and services to target audiences. The Company carefully executes its media strategy by using billboard signage, street posters,
bus ads, social media posting, digital TV ads, creating video-on-demand advertising, and attending events at schools, colleges, and university
campuses. 

The
App s official launch is expected to be in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company intends to use traditional marketing strategies
such as billboard signage, digital TV ads, creating video-on-demand advertising, and attending events at schools, colleges, and university
campuses after the App s official launch. Currently, the Company uses only online marketing, mainly social media campaigns, including
engagement of celebrities and influencers and educational and other incentives-based posts on social media, to drive online traffic to
its websites or directly to the App Store. 

The
Company implements an effective marketing funnel where we map out our subscribers journey from when they are a lead and then tailored
strategies to encourage them to move through this funnel. 

We
also utilize many indirect channels where a network of industry professionals, introducing and referring affiliates as third parties,
promote our services in exchange for performance-based compensation. In most cases, affiliates carry out the lead generation function,
while the Company s staff provides subscribers and technical support to subscribers. 

Most
of the marketing and branding initiatives are taken in-house by our team. The Company may hire outside marketing and branding consultants
and advertising firms from time to time.

Industry
and Competitive Analysis 

A
student loan is money that the federal government and private institutions lend to students or parents to finance post-secondary education.
Most students who get a bachelor s degree finance their education with one or more student loans. Student loans are the largest
source of debt in the United States after mortgages. Student loans do not require the borrower to provide collateral, such as a house
or a car, to guarantee the loan. The interest payment on the student loan is tax-deductible up to a maximum of 2,500. However, student
loans are usually disbursed directly to the educational institution s financial aid office. The loans can only be used to cover
tuition, college fees, room and board, living expenses while at college, and books. In most cases, bankruptcy laws do not allow the discharge
of student loans under bankruptcy. 

Public
and Private Student Debt 

43.4
million student loan borrowers in the United States owe a collective nearly 1.75 trillion in federal and private student loan debt as
of April 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (1) . According to a July 2021 report by MeasureOne (2) ,
academic data firm about 92 of student debt is owned by the US Department of Education, referred to as Public student debt.
The balance of student debt, referred to as Private Student Loans, makes up 7.89 of the total outstanding US student loans, equal to
 131.10 billion.

Average
Student Loans 

The
average student debt is estimated to be 28,950 and 71,000 for graduate and post-graduate students. The average US household with student
debt owes 57,520, according to NerdWallet s 2020 household debt study. 

Parent
PLUS loans (3) are direct federal loans parents can use to pay for their dependent child s education. According to federal
loan data, the average outstanding parent PLUS loan debt is 28,778. Total parent PLUS debt: 104.8 billion distributed among 3.7 million
parent PLUS borrowers.

Status
of Student Loan Repayment (4) 

The
government offered student loan relief in 2020, which caused forbearance spikes and data suspension from federal agencies. There are
6.42 million federal loan borrowers in school, 1.17 million federal borrowers in the grace period, 460,000 federal loan borrowers in
repayment, 3.05 million federal loan borrowers in deferment, and 26.78 million federal loan borrowers with loans in forbearance. 

Borrowers
can also postpone private student loan payments via deferment or forbearance, but interest always accrues regardless of whether the borrower
makes payments. If public student loan borrowers can t make payments, they can postpone them through deferment or forbearance.
Interest typically accrues during these periods, but borrowers with subsidized loans don t owe the interest that accrues during
deferment. 

The
US Government paused federal student loan repayments and interest during the pandemic throughout 2021 and extended it into the fall of
2022. Despite the freeze, student loan balances still increased as newer loans entered repayment, despite no current payment due on most
loans.

Status
of Student Loan Default (5) 

Student
loan default happens after a missed payment period after approximately 270 days (or nine months) past due. Private student loans typically
default after three missed payments (typically three months). Still, according to the lender s terms and conditions, it can happen
after one missed payment. Around 9.7 of student loan borrowers default after entering repayment within a couple of years.

Student
Loan Forgiveness Options 

The
US Government provides several student loan forgiveness options and plans, including but not limited to: 

Public
 Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or PSLF Waiver forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after making 120 qualifying
 monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. 

Income-driven
 repayment forgiveness sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount intended to be affordable based on your income
 and family size. 

Borrower
 defense to repayment if the school misled or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws, the student
 borrower may be eligible for borrower defense to loan repayment, to the discharge of some or all of federal student
 loan debt, and 

Free
 Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA is the application for financial aid completed by current and prospective
 college students in the United States to determine their eligibility for student financial aid. 

We
believe the personal debt management industry is highly fragmented and diversified, with several large and small companies offering a
wide variety of debt management solutions. We believe that our direct and indirect competition includes but is not limited to HR benefits
platforms, round-up saving and investing apps, personal finance and credit bureau platforms, personal finance educational tools, and
other personal debt management companies. General financial content providers may also be considered indirect competition. Our target
market is student loan borrowers looking to better their financial future by paying their loans and saving money. We offer a unique solution
catered to student loan management in the most comprehensive and user-friendly way for the borrower and the servicer. 

Our
industry is active in mergers and acquisitions of digital debt management software companies by large and well-capitalized companies
looking for complementary services. For example, in July 2018, LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE) announced today that it had entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire Student Loan Hero, Inc. (6) , a personal finance website dedicated to helping student loan
borrowers manage their student debt. In April 2021, Acorns, the Californian investment and savings app, landed its second acquisition
of 2021 with artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Pillar (7) .

According
to the Harvard Kennedy School report (8) , the fintech industry deals with the dangers of potential misuse and abuse of consumer
data. This includes but is not limited to the loss of privacy; violation of data security; increasing risks of fraud and scams; unfair
and discriminatory uses of data and data analytics against rules and regulations; uses of data that are non-transparent to both consumers
and regulators; harmful manipulation of consumer behavior; and risks that tech firms entering the financial or financial regulatory space
will lack adequate knowledge, operational effectiveness, and stability. 

The
student loan forgiveness debate has entered into the national conversation. White House officials plan to cancel 10,000 in student debt
per borrower after months of internal deliberations over how to structure loan forgiveness for tens of millions of Americans. According
to Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank wiping out 10,000 of debt per borrower could cost roughly 230
billion. 

The
Company firmly believes that the student loan industry will continue to be the fastest-growing source of debt for the United States households.
Student loans are now the largest source of unsecured debt in the United States. They have become a financial industry, especially with
its secondary market and student loan asset-backed securities.

March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the United States.
While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries and reported infections globally. Many countries
worldwide, including the United States, implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including temporary
closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the business. Even
though the pandemic appears to slow down and is in control, these measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s
labor workforce, and other disruptions. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments.
These developments are highly uncertain. We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak
and the actions required to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. In particular, the spread of the coronavirus globally could
adversely impact our operations and workforce, including our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital,
which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation results. 

Russia-Ukraine
Conflict 

The
geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The war between the
two countries continues to evolve as military activity continues. The United States and certain European countries have imposed additional
sanctions on Russia and specific individuals. As of the date of this filing, there has been no disruption in our operations.

 MARKET
 FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

SHARES
ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE 

At
present, we do not have a public market; the selling shareholders will offer and sell their shares at a fixed price until our shares
are listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTCQX, or OTCQB, or any other stock exchange, at which
time they may be sold at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. Future sales of substantial amounts of our
Common Shares in the public market, including Common Shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or debt conversion,
or the anticipation of these sales, could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to
raise capital through sales of equity securities. 

Holders 

We
have 63,660,926 Common Shares issued and outstanding held by 77 shareholders of record, calculated as of December 31, 2022, by our Direct
Transfer, LLC., a subsidiary of Issuer Direct Corporation, our Transfer Agent, assuming no exercise of outstanding options or warrants
and no exercise of the underwriters option. All of the Common Shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction
immediately following this offering, except that any Common Shares purchased by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under
the Securities Act, may only be sold in compliance with the limitations described below. All remaining Common Shares held by existing
shareholders immediately before this offering will be restricted securities as defined in Rule 144. These restricted securities
were issued and sold by us in private transactions and are eligible for public sale only if registered under the Securities Act or if
they qualify for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, including the exemptions provided by Rule 144 or Rule 701,
summarized below. 

Dividends 

The
Company did not declare any cash dividends for the December 31, 2022 fiscal year. Our Board of Director(s) (currently constituted by
Trent M. McKendrick) does not intend to distribute any cash dividends in the near term. The Board of Directors decides the declaration,
payment, timing, and amount of future dividends. The dividends will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash
flows, financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors the Board of Directors considers relevant. There is
no assurance that the Company shall pay any future dividends. If the Company decides to pay dividends, there is no assurance concerning
dividends. 

Sale
of Restricted Securities 

Our
Common Shares sold pursuant to this offering will be registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, freely transferable, except
for our affiliates shares. Our affiliates will be deemed to own control securities not registered for resale under
the registration statement covering this Report. Individuals who may be considered our affiliates after this offering include individuals
who control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us, as those terms generally are interpreted for federal securities
law purposes. These individuals may include some or all of our directors and executive officers. Individuals who are our affiliates are
not permitted to resell their securities unless such securities are separately registered under an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available, such as Rule 144. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities 

All
of the Company s recent sales of unregistered securities within the past three years reported previously reported as required in
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed November 14, 2022. 

Rule
144 

In
general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated), including an affiliate, who beneficially
owns restricted securities (i.e., securities that are not registered by an effective registration statement) of a reporting
company may not sell these securities until the person has beneficially owned them for at least six months. Thereafter, affiliates
may not sell within any three months a number of shares above the greater of: (i) 1 percent of the then outstanding shares as shown by
the most recent report or statement published by the issuer; and (ii) the average weekly reported trading volume in such securities during
the four preceding calendar weeks. 

Sales
under Rule 144 by our affiliates will also be subject to restrictions relating to the manner of sale, notice, and the availability of
current public information about us. They may be affected only through unsolicited brokers transactions. 

Persons
not deemed to be affiliates who have beneficially owned restricted securities for at least six months but less than one
year may sell these securities, provided that current public information about the Company is available, which means that,
on the date of sale, we have been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for at least ninety days and are currently
in our Exchange Act filings. After beneficially owning restricted securities for one year, our non-affiliates may engage
in unlimited resales of such securities. 

Shares
received by our affiliates in this offering, upon exercise of stock options, or upon vesting other equity-linked awards may be control
securities rather than restricted securities. Control securities are subject to the same volume limitations
as restricted securities but are not subject to holding period requirements. 

Rule
701 

Rule
701 generally allows a shareholder who purchased our Common Shares pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not
deemed to have been our affiliate during the immediately preceding ninety days to sell those shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without
being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also
permits our affiliates to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144.
However, all holders of Rule 701 shares are required to wait until ninety days after the date of this Report before selling such shares
pursuant to Rule 701 and until the lock-up period described below expires. 

ADMISSION
TO QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD AND OTC LINKS 

We
intend to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board and/nor OTC Link, a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value
of our securities. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it: (i) is not situated in a single
location but operates through the communication of bids, offers, and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (ii) securities admitted
to the quotation are offered by one or more Broker-dealers rather than the specialist common to stock exchanges. 

To
qualify for a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link, the Company s equity security requires one registered broker-dealer,
known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and sponsor the company listing. We do not yet have an agreement with
a registered broker-dealer, as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and sponsor the Company listing. If the Company
meets the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link, our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin
Board and/or OTC Link until a future time, if at all. We may not now, and it may never qualify for a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board
and/or OTC Link.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This
Annual Report Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth due to general
economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes
and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. 

Lever
Global Corporation (the Company, we, our, or us was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware on March 24, 2022. We are a fintech-driven consumer liabilities and debt management company. Our mission is
to empower subscribers to use our App to become financially independent by managing all of their liabilities and debt obligations in
one place. Mr. McKendrick is the Company s Founder, CEO, and Director and has started several fintech companies focusing on credit
and debt management for consumers and businesses since 2015. The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Lever Technology, Inc. Lever
Technology ), a California corporation. There are no operating activities for Lever Technology. 

The
Company had a soft launch of the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on the iOS App Store. Currently, the App allows the subscribers
to analyze their existing student loans and recommend programs the US Department of Education offers after the initial
assessment and processes enrollments into these programs. The App provides a list of qualified federal programs. The subscribers can
digitally enroll in these programs by uploading or self-declaring their W-2, wage, or tax statements through the App. If subscribers
are accepted for a federal program, the App manages their annual certifications for a monthly subscription fee. The average life of a
loan is twenty-one years. The Company has partnered with Array US, Inc. to give subscribers personalized credit and financial data through
the App, allowing them to understand their borrowing capacity better. The subscribers can also use the information to manage their credit
scores. 

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company added a round-up option, allowing subscribers to link their bank account and student loan
to the App and select to pay a few cents per transaction towards the principal of their student loan. The App will have a feature showing
the subscriber how the extra payments towards the loan will result in interest savings and reduce the loan term. 

In
fiscal 2023, the Company intends to offer its subscribers the tools in the App to directly negotiate and refinance their outstanding
credit card and auto loans with their lenders. The Company plans to connect several credit card companies and auto loan providers to
the App through API. As well as provide more ways to save, spend and invest through the development, acquisition, and key hires across
these technologies. The Company also plans to launch the App officially in the App Store and Play Store in the fiscal 2023. There is
no assurance that the Company will be successful in future plans. 

The
App allows everyday people to directly negotiate, enroll, repay, and settle student loans for the US market without the complexity and
confusion of the fine print. The App helps subscribers with debt management - negotiation, repayment, and settlement. We are committed
to providing our subscribers impartial guidance in their journey toward financial independence. The App will be available on the Play
Store (Android) and App Store (iOS) under Lever App (the App as its brand name for a subscription-based fee billed monthly
or annually. 

The
App will help the subscriber directly negotiate debt through continued education and recommendations on how and when to refinance the
student loan, federal student loan prequalification and enrollment, access credit scores, and other features that enable subscribers
to manage their debt obligations smartly, intuitively, and cost-effectively. The Company initially intends to target student debt holders
in the United States as its primary customer base. The Company believes that manually managing debt is complex and time-consuming, which
involves actively monitoring personal finances, estimating payments, negotiating with lenders, and finding the proper federal and state
grants and loan arrangements. Maintaining and monitoring these loan terms with annual renewals that can last up to twenty-one (21) years
on average isn t easy. 

A
student loan default has severe consequences for the borrower as it damages the borrower s credit score, making it difficult to
qualify for future loans. Still, the borrower may also be subject to wage garnishment when the lender automatically takes a portion of
the paycheck to repay the loan. In addition, defaulting on a student loan can lead to the seizure of tax refunds and Social Security
benefits. The Company believes that if borrowers struggle to make student loan payments, it s crucial to take action before falling
too far behind. The Lever App allows the borrower to contact the loan servicer to discuss options, including deferment or forbearance.
The Company believes acting through its intuitive technology can help them avoid the devastating consequences of student loan default. 

12 

The
Company believes the student loan borrower will benefit from the App. Our Application Program Interface (APIs) and artificial intelligence
(AI) driven programming connect them to the right and relevant federal loan programs with the most favorable terms qualifying
amount and rate, enroll and save with a few clicks. The Lever App further informs the subscribers when and how to refinance their student
loans. Based on the subscriber s inputs, the Lever App provides visual guidelines on how the subscriber s budget and spending
suit their student loan repayments. 

The
Lever App provides subscribers instant matches through Student Aid, the largest provider of financial aid for college in the United States,
and other Federal student aid programs. The subscriber can access the complex world of student debt management in an easy four-step process
through the Lever App, which includes: 

Basic
 subscriber information per KYC requirements, 

The
 subscriber links one or multiple loans in real-time, also known as Enrollment, 

The
 software matches with up to three (3) options to manage loans (deferment or forbearance or reduced payments, etc.), and 

The
 subscriber picks the best option to connect to the best United States Government aid program to complete the application. 

Once
subscribers sync their respective loans with the Lever App, the software automates with a data-driven algorithm to match users with qualifying
federal loan programs. The App also provides credit score insights and payment round-up technology using open banking protocols that
help and recommend that loan borrowers contribute micro amounts towards their loan principal, save on years of interest, and reach financial
independence faster and better with the App. 

The
Company expects to continue to earn revenues through a subscription-based model, which will charge monthly recurring fees to subscribers.
The Company is developing and testing the App, which it expects to market and launch in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The App will
be available on the App Store and PlayStore. 

We
are a development stage entity devoting all our efforts to substantially establishing our flagship product, the Lever App App ).
The App s official launch is expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. From March 24, 2022 Inception Date to
December 31, 2022, the Company earned 16,878 in subscription revenue. Our independent auditors have raised concerns about our ability
to continue as a going concern. We expect the Company to raise significant additional capital to accomplish its growth plan over the
next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that financing and/or capital might be available to the Company. 

13 

PLAN
OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company has prepared consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. From March 24, 2022 Inception Date to December
31, 2022, the Company earned 16,878 in subscription revenue. 

Our
experienced Management and in-house software development team have carefully designed various B2C debt management solutions to meet the
needs of borrowers in the United States and Australia. We intend to grow our core business, increase market share, and improve profitability
principally by deploying the following growth strategies: 

Completed
 the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with the soft launch, and launch the App officially to the public in the third quarter
 of fiscal 2023; 

Ramp
 up subscriber acquisition through our digital and traditional marketing strategies; 

Continue
 to enhance and promote our core proprietary debt management platform and introduce other innovative debt management tools for the
 United States student loan borrowers; 

Future
 growth will depend on the timely development and successful distribution of the Lever App by signing enterprise and employer deals
 in the United States; 

Increase
 our software development capabilities to develop disruptive and next-generation machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven
 technologies to grow and retain subscriber base; 

Grow
 subscriber base through accretive acquisitions, opportunistic investments, and beneficial partnerships; and 

Recognize
 and enter high-growth markets to expand our services to meet the demand for other financial solutions, including but not limited
 to auto-save and auto loan payment from day-to-day debit card usage.

Financial
Conditions at December 31, 2022 

On
December 31, 2022, the Company had 315,788 cash to execute its business plan and accumulated a deficit of 1,932,194. The Company had
a working capital surplus of 75,299 on December 31, 2022. Lever Holdings provided the working base source code for the launch of the
Company, valued at 758,316; the contributed tangible software. 

The
Company believes it has the necessary funding and in-house capabilities to develop and successfully launch the App. The Company budgets
 500,000 for sales and marketing campaigns in the next twelve months. Should we require additional capital to the extent the Company s
operations are insufficient to fund its capital requirements, the Company may attempt to raise capital through the issuance of equity
or debt. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern may depend on Management s plans success. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Fiscal
Year Ended December 31, 2022 

The
Company generated 16,878 for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022. During the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, the Company
had a net income loss of 1,932,194. 

During
the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022, the Company incurred general administrative costs G and A of 1,189,111.
During the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022, the Company incurred sales and marketing costs of 690,212. The sales marketing

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At
December 31, 2022, we had a cash balance of 315,788. The Company had a working capital surplus of 75,299 on December 31, 2022. 

Since
its inception, the Company has sustained losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Management believes that cash on hand may
not be sufficient for the Company to meet working capital and corporate development needs as they become due in the ordinary course of
business for twelve (12) months following December 31, 2022. From inception to December 31, 2022, the Company had earned 16,878 in revenues
and had an operating loss of 1,923,711. The Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations and the ongoing requirement
for substantial additional capital investment to develop its financial technologies. We expect to conduct the planned operations for
a maximum of twelve months using currently available capital resources. The Management anticipates raising significant additional capital
to accomplish its growth plan over the next twelve (12) months. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new funding sources.
The Management expects to seek to obtain additional funding through private equity or public markets. However, there can be no assurance
about the availability or terms such as financing and capital might be available. 

In
the next twelve months, the Company will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support, development of technology solutions,
and enhancement of existing technology to serve our customers. We expect capital expenditures to increase to up to 250,000 in the next
twelve months to support the growth, which mainly includes software development, acquisition of complementary software, and purchasing
of computers and servers. In addition, the Company estimates additional expenditure needed to be 500,000, which provides for 100,000
and 400,000 for sales marketing, and working capital, respectively. 

For
the next six to nine months, we expect existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and access to funding to be sufficient to fund
our operating activities and other cash commitments, such as related party payments and material capital expenditures. However, we may
need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance
that any additional financing will be available or, if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

GOING
CONCERN CONSIDERATION 

We
generated 16,878 in revenues from inception to December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company accumulated a deficit of 1,932,194.
Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the audited financial statements for Form S-1/A (Amendment
3) filed on September 19, 2022, regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain
additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result in the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

We
have based our Management s discussion, and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements,
which we have prepared following the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Our actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material and uncertain in the current economic environment
due to COVID-19. 

In
more detail, we have described significant accounting policies in Note 2 of our Form S-/A (Amendment 3) statements filed with the SEC
on September 19, 2022. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update
them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

JOBS
Act Accounting Election 

We
are an emerging growth company , defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can
take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging
growth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We
have elected not to avail ourselves of the delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, we will adopt new or revised
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for
other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We
have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC s Regulation S-B. We did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that
would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption
of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We have adopted this ASU as of the inception date of March 24, 2022, for ASC 606, Revenue Recognition and Amended ASU 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 840). The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we have described
significant accounting policies in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in Form S-/A (Amendment 3) statements
filed with the SEC on September 19, 2022, we believe the accounting policies as described in Note 2 to be critical to the judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of our company, 

 (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors, and 

 (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2022. Based on our assessments,
management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to the
material weakness in our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel
and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business identifying
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the
requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in the
internal controls and financial reporting process. 

This
Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting materially.

Term
of Office 

All
directors serve until the next annual meeting; their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve for one year
until the board of directors meeting following the stockholders annual meeting until the Directors successors have
been elected and qualified. 

Director
of Independence 

Our
board of directors is currently composed of four (4) members, out of which three (3) directors are executive directors and who do not
qualify as independent directors by the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market (the Company has no plans to list
on the NASDAQ Global Market). The third non-executive director is an independent director. The NASDAQ independence definition includes
a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three (3) years, one of our employees and
that neither the director nor any of his family members have engaged in various types of business dealings with us. Also, our board of
directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of our board
of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. However,
the NASDAQ rules require such subjective determination. Had our board of directors made these determinations, they would have reviewed
and discussed the information provided by directors and us concerning our director s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management. 

Audit
Committee and Conflicts of Interest 

Since
we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that such committees would have performed
are performed by our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has not established an audit committee and does not have an audit committee
financial expert, nor has the Board of Directors established a nominating committee. The Board believes such committees are unnecessary
since the Company is an early start-up company with only three (3) directors. To date, such directors have been performing the functions
of such committees. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our three (3) directors and officers have the authority to
determine issues concerning management compensation, nominations, and audit issues that may affect management decisions. 

There
are no family relationships among our directors or officers other than as described above. We are unaware of any other conflicts of interest
with our executive officers or directors. 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

No
director, person nominated to become a director, executive officer, promoter, or control person of our Company has, during the last ten
(10) years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of
the such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating
activities subject to any federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting
involvement in any business activity, or finding any violation to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against
the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two
(2) years prior thereto. 

Stockholder
Communications with the Board Of Directors 

We
have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our board of directors. Nevertheless,
every effort will be made to ensure that the board hears the views of stockholders of directors and that the appropriate responses are
provided to stockholders promptly. Our board of directors will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process
during the upcoming year.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Lever Global Corporation 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lever Global Corporation as of December 31, 2022, the related statements
of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared to assume the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to
the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition,
the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
App allows everyday people to directly negotiate, enroll, repay, and settle student loans for the US market without the complexity and
confusion of the fine print. The App helps subscribers with debt management - negotiation, repayment, and settlement. We are committed
to providing our subscribers with impartial guidance in their journey toward financial independence. The App will be available on the
Play Store (Android) and App Store (iOS) under Lever App (the App as its brand name for a subscription-based fee billed
monthly or annually. 

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

The
App will help the subscriber manage and resolve liabilities such as credit cards, student loans, and other types of consumer debts through
continued education and recommendations on how and when to refinance the student loan with the department of education, federal student
loan prequalification and enrollment, access credit scores, and other features that enable subscribers to manage their debt obligations
smartly, intuitively, and cost-effectively. The Company initially intends to target student debt holders in the United States as its
primary customer base. The Company believes that manually managing liabilities is complex and time-consuming, which involves actively
monitoring personal finances, estimating payments, negotiating with lenders, and finding the proper federal and state grants and loan
arrangements. It is difficult to maintain and monitor these loan terms with annual renewals that can last up to twenty-one (21) years
on average. 

The
Company believes the student loan borrower will benefit from the App. Our Application Program Interface (APIs) and artificial intelligence
(AI) driven programming connect them to the right and relevant federal loan programs with the most favorable terms qualifying
amount and rate, enrolling and saving with a few clicks. The Lever App further informs the subscribers when and how to refinance their
student loans. 

Based
on the inputs the subscriber provides, the Lever App provides visual guidelines on how the subscriber s budget and spending suit
their current and future liabilities, including their student loan repayments, and provides a smarter way to repay their debts through
features like payment round-ups and extra repayment recommendations, to help a subscriber pay off the liabilities smarter, without affecting
their existing spending habits. 

 The
Lever App provides subscribers instant matches through Student Aid, the largest provider of financial aid for college in the United States,
and other Federal student aid programs. The subscriber can access the complex world of student debt management in an easy four-step process
through the Lever App, which includes: 

Basic
 subscriber information per KYC requirements, 

The
 subscriber links one or multiple loans in real-time, also known as Enrollment, 

The
 software matches with up to three (3) options to manage loans (deferment or forbearance or reduced payments, etc.), and 

The
 subscriber picks the best option to connect to the best United States Government aid program to complete the application. 

Once
subscribers sync their respective liabilities and loans with the Lever App, the software automates with a data-driven algorithm to match
users with better ways to repay debts, such as providing automation for snowball or avalanche plans and extra repayment recommendations
for managing liabilities. The App also includes credit score insights and payment round-up technology using open banking protocols that
help and recommend that loan borrowers contribute micro amounts towards their loan principal, saving on years of interest and reaching
financial independence faster and better with the App. 

Business
Strategy 

Our
experienced Management and in-house software development team have carefully designed various B2C debt management solutions to meet the
needs of borrowers in the United States and globally. We intend to grow our core business, increase market share, and improve profitability
principally by deploying the following growth strategies: 

Complete
 version 1 of the App in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 with the soft launch, and launch the App officially to the public in the
 third quarter of fiscal 2023; 

Ramp
 up subscriber acquisition through our digital and traditional marketing strategies; 

Continue
 to enhance and promote our core proprietary liabilities and debt management app and introduce other innovative repayments, finance,
 and spending features for United States consumers; 

Future
 growth will depend on the timely development and successful distribution of the Lever App by signing enterprise and employer deals
 in the United States; 

Increase
 our software development capabilities to develop disruptive and next-generation machine learning and artificial intelligence-driven
 technologies to grow and retain subscriber base; 

Grow
 subscriber base through accretive acquisitions, opportunistic investments, and beneficial partnerships; and; 

Recognize
 and enter high-growth markets to expand our services to meet the demand for other financial solutions, including but not limited
 to auto-save and auto loan repayment from day-to-day debit card usage and investments such as IRAs and 401Ks. 

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

Marketing
and Sales 

The
Company aims to be flexible and responsive to its sales and marketing strategies to provide an omnichannel customer experience. Therefore,
our primary focus is on different subscriber acquisition channels to expand our paid customer base. The Company is actively integrating
digital and traditional marketing channels effectively, as we believe these are scalable channels and that one-size-fits-most customers
no longer work. Our marketing strategy identifies and targets student borrowers who are high-value/high-potential subscribers. We have
found that these customers are often more receptive to a digital marketing strategy that includes SEO marketing, an intuitive website
experience, targeted emails/ content, educational blogs, and active social media engagement involving celebrities and influencers. For
traditional marketing, such as conferences, trade shows, expos, media events, and direct meetings, the senior Management in person provides
presentations, gives media interviews, and engages potential subscribers at events. 

We
have designed our marketing and sales strategies to drive prospective subscribers to the Play Store and App Store, where they can download
our App. 

To
spread the word, the Company has engaged celebrities and influencers, such as Austin Reaves (Age 23), to promote and endorse the Company s
products and services to target audiences. The Company carefully executes its media strategy by using billboard signage, street posters,
bus ads, social media posting, digital TV ads, creating video-on-demand advertising, and attending events at schools, colleges, and university
campuses. 

The
App s official launch is expected to be in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company intends to use traditional marketing strategies
such as billboard signage, digital TV ads, creating video-on-demand advertising, and attending events at schools, colleges, and university
campuses after the App s official launch. Currently, the Company uses only online marketing, mainly social media campaigns, including
engagement of celebrities and influencers and educational and other incentives-based posts on social media, to drive online traffic to
its websites or directly to the App Store. 

The
Company implements an effective marketing funnel where we map out our subscribers journey from when they are a lead and then tailored
strategies to encourage them to move through this funnel. 

We
also utilize many indirect channels where a network of industry professionals, introducing and referring affiliates as third parties,
promote our services in exchange for performance-based compensation. In most cases, affiliates carry out the lead generation function,
while the Company s staff provides subscribers and technical support to subscribers. 

Most
of the marketing and branding initiatives are taken in-house by our team. The Company may hire outside marketing and branding consultants
and advertising firms from time to time.

Industry
and Competitive Analysis 

A
student loan is money that the federal government and private institutions lend to students or parents to finance post-secondary education.
Most students who get a bachelor s degree finance their education with one or more student loans. Student loans are the largest
source of debt in the United States after mortgages. Student loans do not require the borrower to provide collateral, such as a house
or a car, to guarantee the loan. The interest payment on the student loan is tax-deductible up to a maximum of . However, student
loans are usually disbursed directly to the educational institution s financial aid office. The loans can only be used to cover
tuition, college fees, room and board, living expenses while at college, and books. In most cases, bankruptcy laws do not allow the discharge
of student loans under bankruptcy. 

Public
and Private Student Debt 

million student loan borrowers in the United States owe a collective nearly 1.75 trillion in federal and private student loan debt as
of April 2022, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (1) . According to a July 2021 report by MeasureOne (2) ,
academic data firm about of student debt is owned by the US Department of Education, referred to as Public student debt.
The balance of student debt, referred to as Private Student Loans, makes up of the total outstanding US student loans, equal to
 billion.

Borrowers
can also postpone private student loan payments via deferment or forbearance, but interest always accrues regardless of whether the borrower
makes payments. If public student loan borrowers can t make payments, they can postpone them through deferment or forbearance.
Interest typically accrues during these periods, but borrowers with subsidized loans don t owe the interest that accrues during
deferment. 

The
US Government paused federal student loan repayments and interest during the pandemic throughout 2021 and extended it into the fall of
2022. Despite the freeze, student loan balances still increased as newer loans entered repayment, despite no current payment due on most
loans.

Loan Forgiveness Options 

The
US Government provides several student loan forgiveness options and plans, including but not limited to: 

Public
 Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or PSLF Waiver forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after making 120 qualifying
 monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. 

Income-driven
 repayment forgiveness sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount intended to be affordable based on your income
 and family size.

 defense to repayment if the school misled or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws, the student
 borrower may be eligible for borrower defense to loan repayment, to the discharge of some or all of federal student
 loan debt, and 

Free
 Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA is the application for financial aid completed by current and prospective
 college students in the United States to determine their eligibility for student financial aid. 

We
believe the personal debt management industry is highly fragmented and diversified, with several large and small companies offering a
wide variety of debt management solutions. We believe that our direct and indirect competition includes but is not limited to HR benefits
platforms, round-up saving and investing apps, personal finance and credit bureau platforms, personal finance educational tools, and
other personal debt management companies. General financial content providers may also be considered indirect competition. Our target
market is student loan borrowers looking to better their financial future by paying their loans and saving money. We offer a unique solution
catered to student loan management in the most comprehensive and user-friendly way for the borrower and the servicer. 

Our
industry is active in mergers and acquisitions of digital debt management software companies by large and well-capitalized companies
looking for complementary services. For example, in July 2018, LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE) announced today that it had entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire Student Loan Hero, Inc. (6) , a personal finance website dedicated to helping student loan
borrowers manage their student debt. In April 2021, Acorns, the Californian investment and savings app, landed its second acquisition
of 2021 with artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Pillar (7) . 

NOTE
1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (continued) 

According
to the Harvard Kennedy School report (8) , the fintech industry deals with the dangers of potential misuse and abuse of consumer
data. This include but is not limited to the loss of privacy; violation of data security; increasing risks of fraud and scams; unfair
and discriminatory uses of data and data analytics against rules and regulations; uses of data that are non-transparent to both consumers
and regulators; harmful manipulation of consumer behavior; and risks that tech firms entering the financial or financial regulatory space
will lack adequate knowledge, operational effectiveness, and stability. 

The
student loan forgiveness debate has entered into the national conversation. White House officials are planning to cancel in student
debt per borrower after months of internal deliberations over how to structure loan forgiveness for tens of millions of Americans. According
to Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank wiping out of debt per borrower could cost roughly 
billion. 

The
Company firmly believes that the student loan industry will continue to be the fastest-growing source of debt for United States households.
Student loans are now the largest source of unsecured debt in the United States. They have become a financial industry in its own right,
especially with its secondary market and student loan asset-backed securities.

Covid-19 

In
March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic throughout the United
States. While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries and reported infections globally. Many
countries worldwide, including the United States, implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including
temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the business.
Even though the pandemic appears to slow down and is in control, these measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company s
labor workforce, and other disruptions. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments.
These developments are highly uncertain. We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak
and the actions required to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally
could adversely impact our operations and workforce, including our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital,
which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation results. 

Russia-Ukraine
Conflict 

The
geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The war between the
two countries continues to evolve as military activity continues. The United States and certain European countries have imposed additional
sanctions on Russia and specific individuals. As of the date of this filing, there has been no disruption in our operations.

We evaluate contributed tangible software for impairment at least annually to confirm if the carrying amount of contributed tangible
software exceeds their fair value. The contributed tangible software primarily consists of the source code of the Lever App, fundamental

2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in
Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ,
issued in August 2020 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock by removing the requirements to
present certain conversion features in equity separately. In addition, the amendments also simplify the guidance in ASC Subtopic 815-40,
Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, by removing certain criteria that must be satisfied to classify a contract
as equity, which is expected to decrease the number of freestanding instruments and embedded derivatives accounted for as assets or liabilities.
Finally, the amendments revise the guidance on calculating earnings per share, requiring the use of the if-converted method for all convertible
instruments and rescinding an entity s ability to rebut the presumption of share settlement for instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets. The amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early
adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The guidance must be adopted as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this ASU 2020-06 to impact its condensed consolidated financial statements.
