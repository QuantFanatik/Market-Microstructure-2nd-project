 GLOSSARY OF SELECTED PETROLEUM INDUSTRY TERMS 

Term Definition Bbl One stock tank barrel, of 42 U.S. gallons of liquid volume, used herein in reference to oil or NGL. BCF Billion cubic feet. BFPD Barrels of fluid per day. BOE Barrels of oil equivalent. BOE is calculated by converting six MCF of natural gas and 42 gallons of NGL to one Bbl of oil which reflects energy equivalence and not price equivalence. Natural gas prices per MCF and NGL prices per barrel often differ significantly from the equivalent amount of oil. BOEPD Barrels of oil equivalent per day. BOPD Barrels of oil per day. BTU British Thermal Unit: the standard unit of measure of energy equal to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. One Bbl of oil is typically 5.8 MMBTU, and one standard MCF is typically one MMBTU. CO 2 Carbon Dioxide; CO 2 is a gas that can be found in naturally occurring reservoirs, is typically associated with ancient volcanoes, is a major byproduct from manufacturing and power production, and is also utilized in enhanced oil recovery through injection into an oil reservoir. Developed Reserves Reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by a means not involving a well. EOR Enhanced Oil Recovery; projects that involve injection of heat, miscible or immiscible gas, or chemicals into oil reservoirs, typically following full primary and secondary waterflood recovery efforts, in order to gain incremental recovery of oil from the reservoir. Field An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped within or related to the same geologic structural features and/or stratigraphic features. Farmout Sale or transfer of all or part of the operating rights from the working interest owner (the assignor or farmout party), to an assignee (the farm-in party) who assumes all or some of the burden of development, in return for an interest in the property. The assignor may retain an overriding royalty or any other type of interest. For Federal tax purposes, a farmout may be structured as a sale or lease, depending on the specific rights and carved out interests retained by the assignor. Gross Acres or Gross Wells The total acres or number of wells participated in, regardless of the amount of working interest owned. Horizontal Drilling Involves drilling horizontally out from a vertical well-bore, thereby potentially increasing the area and reach of the well-bore that is in contact with the reservoir. Hydraulic Fracturing Involves pumping a fluid with or without particulates into a formation at high pressure, thereby creating fractures in the rock and leaving the particulates in the fractures to ensure that the fractures remain open which potentially increases the ability of the reservoir to produce oil or natural gas. LOE Lease Operating Expense(s); a current period expense incurred to operate a well. MBBL One thousand barrels. MMBBL One million barrels. MBOE One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. MBOEPD One thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. MMBOE One million barrels of oil equivalent. MCF One thousand cubic feet of natural gas at standard conditions, being approximately sea level pressure and 60 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. MMCF One million cubic feet of natural gas at standard conditions, being approximately sea level pressure and 60 degrees Fahrenheit temperature. MMBTU One million British Thermal Units. Mineral Royalty Interest A royalty interest that is retained by the owner of the minerals underlying a lease. See Royalty Interest. 
 iv 

Table of Contents 
 Net Acres or Net Wells The sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross acres or gross wells. NGL Natural Gas Liquids; the combination of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline that can be removed from natural gas through processing, typically through refrigeration plants that utilize low temperatures, or through plants that utilize compression, temperature reduction and expansion to a lower pressure. Non-operated Interest An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property but does not participate in or have any responsibility for actual operation of the property. Non-operated Working Interest An interest in an oil and/or natural gas property but does not participate in or have any responsibility for actual operation of the property, but is burdened with the cost of development and operation of the property. NYMEX New York Mercantile Exchange. OOIP Original Oil in Place; an estimate of the barrels originally contained in a reservoir before any production therefrom. Operator An oil and natural gas joint venture participant that manages the joint venture, pays venture costs and bills the venture s non-operators for their share of venture costs. The operator is also responsible to market all oil and natural gas production, except for those non-operators who take their production in-kind. Overriding Royalty Interest or ORRI A royalty interest that is created out of the operating or working interest. Unlike a royalty interest, an overriding royalty interest terminates with the operating interest from which it was created or carved out of. See Royalty Interest. Permeability The measure of ease with which a fluid can move through a reservoir. The unit of measure is a darcy (d), or any metric derivation thereof, such as a millidarcy (md), where one darcy equals 1,000 millidarcy. Extremely low permeability of 10 millidarcy, or less, are often associated with source rocks, such as shale. Extraction of hydrocarbons from a source rock is more difficult than a sandstone reservoir where permeability typically ranges one to two darcy or more. Porosity The relative volume of the pore space (or open area) compared to the total bulk volume of the reservoir, stated in percent. Higher porosity rocks provide more storage space for hydrocarbon accumulations than lower porosity rocks in a given cubic volume of reservoir. Primary Recovery Method The extraction of oil and natural gas from reservoirs using natural or initial reservoir pressure combined with artificial lift techniques such as pumps. Producing Reserves Any category of reserves that have been developed and production has been initiated. Producing Well Any well that has been developed and production has been initiated. Proved Developed Reserves Proved Reserves that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by a means not involving a well. Proved Developed Nonproducing Reserves Proved Reserves that have been developed and no material amount of capital expenditures are required to bring on production, but production has not yet been initiated due to timing, markets, or lack of third party completed connection to a natural gas sales pipeline. Proved Developed Producing Reserves PDP Proved Reserves that have been developed and production has been initiated. Proved Reserves Estimated quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs which geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.

Table of Contents 
 Proved Undeveloped Reserves PUD Proved Reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. Present Value When used with respect to oil and natural gas reserves, present value means the estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil and natural gas reserves (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves) computed using a discount factor and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Productive Well A well that is producing oil or natural gas or that is capable of production. PV-10 Means the present value, discounted at 10 per annum, of future net revenues (estimated future gross revenues less estimated future costs of production, development, and asset retirement costs) associated with reserves and is not necessarily the same as market value. PV-10 does not include estimated future income taxes. Unless otherwise noted, PV-10 is calculated using the pricing scheme as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). PV-10 of proved reserves is calculated the same as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, except that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes future estimated income taxes discounted at 10 per annum. See the definition of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Reservoir A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. Royalty or Royalty Interest The mineral owner s share of oil or natural gas production (typically between 1/8 and ), free of costs, but subject to severance taxes unless the lessor is a government. In certain circumstances, the royalty owner bears a proportionate share of the costs of making the natural gas saleable, such as processing, compression, and gathering. Secondary Recovery Method The extraction of oil and natural gas from reservoirs utilizing water injection (waterflooding) in order to maintain or increase reservoir pressure and direct the displacement of oil into producing wells. Shut-in Well A well that is not on production, but has not been plugged and abandoned. Wells may be shut-in in anticipation of future utility as a producing well, plugging and abandonment or other use. Standardized Measure The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The Standardized Measure is an estimate of future net cash flows associated with proved reserves, discounted at 10 per annum. Future net cash flows are calculated by reducing future net revenues by estimated future income tax expenses and discounting at 10 per annum. The Standardized Measure and the PV-10 of proved reserves are calculated in the same exact fashion, except that the Standardized Measure includes future estimated income taxes discounted at 10 per annum. The Standardized Measure is in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). Tertiary Recovery Method The extraction of oil and natural gas from reservoirs which employs injection of gas, heat, or chemicals into the reservoir in order to change the physical properties of the oil and aid in its extraction, also known as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). Undeveloped Reserves Reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.

Table of Contents 
 Water Injection Well A well which is used to inject water under high pressure into a producing formation to maintain sufficient pressure to produce the recoverable reserves. Working Interest The interest in the oil and natural gas in place which is burdened with the cost of development and operation of the property. Also called the operating interest. Workover A remedial operation on a completed well to restore, maintain, or improve the well s production.

 PART I Item 1. Business Note: See Glossary of Selected Petroleum Industry Terms starting on page iv. General Evolution Petroleum Corporation Evolution, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company , our , we, us or similar terms) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our long-term goal is to maximize total shareholder return from a diversified portfolio of long-life oil and natural gas properties built through acquisition and through selective development opportunities, production enhancement, and other exploitation efforts on our oil and natural gas properties. Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On September 11, 2023, Evolution s Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly dividend of 0.12 per common share payable September 29, 2023. Senior Secured Credit Facility On May 5, 2023, we entered into the Tenth Amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility which has a current borrowing base of 50.0 million. This amendment, among other things, extends the maturity of our Senior Secured Credit Facility to April 9, 2026 and converts our benchmark interest rate from London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.05 . For further discussion of this amendment and our Senior Secured Credit Facility, see Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations . Appointment of Chief Operating Officer On February 23, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors appointed J. Mark Bunch as Chief Operating Officer COO ). Mr. Bunch had been providing consulting services to the Company since 2016. We entered into an offer letter with Mr. Bunch setting forth his compensation as COO on February 21, 2023. Appointment of Chief Executive Officer On October 27, 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors selected Kelly W. Loyd as President and Chief Executive Officer CEO ). Mr. Loyd had been serving as Interim CEO since June 2022 and has served as a member of the Board of Directors since 2008. We entered into an offer letter with Mr. Loyd setting forth his compensation as CEO on October 25, 2022. Upon commencing employment, Mr. Loyd no longer receives compensation for his services as a member of the Board of Directors. Share Repurchase Program On September 8, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of our common stock in the open market through December 31, 2024. We intend to fund repurchases from available working capital and cash provided by operating activities. As we continue to focus on our goal of maximizing total shareholder return, the Board of Directors and management team believe that a share repurchase program is complimentary to the existing dividend policy and is a tax efficient means to further improve shareholder return. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s

 assessment of the intrinsic value of our shares, our capital needs and resources, the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by our Board of Directors does not require us to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Once we completed repayment of borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility and emerged from our blackout period in December 2022, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan that authorized a broker to repurchase shares in the open market subject to pre-defined limitations on trading volume and price. The plan included a 30-day cooling off period that did not allow repurchases to commence until January 2023. The plan was effective until June 30, 2023 and had a maximum authorized amount of 5.0 million over that period. During the year ended June 30, 2023, 0.6 million shares of our common stock were repurchased under the plan at a total cost of approximately 3.9 million, including incremental direct transaction costs. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled. We may enter into additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future, the terms of which will be approved by the Board of Directors. Business Strategy Our business strategy is to maximize total shareholder return based on our assessment of the operating environment and marketplace, subject to our obligations to other stakeholders. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish our goal of maximizing shareholder return are: Maintaining a strong balance sheet and conservative financial management; Growing the asset base through investment in our existing properties, direct acquisitions of new low decline, long-life oil and natural gas properties, selective development opportunities, or accretive acquisitions of similar companies; and Returning cash to shareholders by sustaining and growing our dividend payout over time or repurchases of our shares in the open market. 
 Properties Our oil and natural gas properties consist of non-operated interests in the following areas: the Jonah Field in Sublette County, Wyoming; the Williston Basin in North Dakota; the Barnett Shale located in North Texas; the Hamilton Dome Field located in Hot Springs County, Wyoming; the Delhi Holt-Bryant Unit in the Delhi Field in Northeast Louisiana; as well as small overriding royalty interests in four onshore central Texas wells.

The approximately 5,900 gross acre unitized field, of which we hold approximately 1,400 net acres, is operated by Merit Energy Company Merit ), a private oil and natural gas company, who owns the vast majority of the remaining working interest in the Hamilton Dome Field. The Hamilton Dome Field is located in the southwest region of the Big Horn Basin in northwest Wyoming. For the year ended June 30, 2023, our average net daily production from the Hamilton Dome Field properties was 0.4 MBOEPD consisting of 100 oil. The primary producing reservoirs in the field are the Tensleep and Phosphoria. Produced oil from the field is subject to Western Canadian Select pricing. Delhi Field Enhanced Oil Recovery CO 2 Flood Onshore Louisiana Our non-operated interests in the Delhi Field, a CO 2 -EOR project, consist of approximately 24 average net working interest, with an associated 19 revenue interest and separate overriding royalty and mineral interests of approximately

 7 yielding a total average net revenue interest of approximately 26 . The field is operated by Denbury Onshore LLC Denbury ), a subsidiary of Denbury Inc. The Delhi Field is located in northeast Louisiana in Franklin, Madison, and Richland Parishes and encompasses approximately 14,000 gross unitized acres, or approximately 3,200 net acres. For the year ended June 30, 2023, our average net daily production from the Delhi Field properties was 1.1 MBOEPD consisting of 80 oil and 20 NGLs. The primary producing reservoirs in the field are the Tuscaloosa and Paluxy formations. Produced oil from the field is priced off of Louisiana Light Sweet LLS crude, which often trades at a premium to West Texas Intermediate WTI ). Refer to Production volumes, average sales price and average production costs table below for further information regarding our properties and their fiscal year results. Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC sets rules related to reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. These rules require disclosure of oil and natural gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the trailing 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Subject to limited exceptions, the rules also require that proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and estimates of reserves quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available. Summary of Oil Gas Reserves for Fiscal Year Ended 2023 Our proved reserves as of June 30, 2023, denominated in thousands of barrels of oil equivalent MBOE ), were estimated by our independent reservoir engineers, Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. NSAI and DeGolyer and MacNaughton D M ), both worldwide petroleum consultants. NSAI evaluated the reserves for our Jonah Field and Williston Basin properties. NSAI began evaluating these properties when we acquired each of them during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter from the firm, which is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. D M evaluated the reserves for our Barnett Shale, Hamilton Dome, and Delhi Field properties. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter from the firm, which is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2023. For additional reserve information, see our Supplemental Disclosure about Oil and Natural Gas Properties (unaudited) to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . The New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was 83.23 per barrel of oil and 4.78 per MMBtu of natural gas. The net price per barrel of NGLs was 33.71, which does not have any single comparable reference index price. The NGL price was based on historical prices received. For periods for which no historical price information was available, we used comparable pricing in the geographic area. Pricing differentials were applied based on quality, processing, transportation, location and other pricing aspects for each individual property and product.

 (1) Equivalent oil reserves are defined as six Mcf of natural gas and 42 gallons of NGLs to one barrel of oil conversion ratio which reflects energy equivalence and not price equivalence. Natural gas prices per Mcf and NGL prices per barrel often differ significantly from the equivalent amount of oil. 
 Our PUD reserves were 3.7 MMBOE as of June 30, 2023, with related future development costs of approximately 71.7 million, which are primarily associated with the Williston Basin properties. The downward revisions were due to adjustments of development timing and economic assumptions at the Williston Basin properties. Extensions of 0.1 MMBOE are associated with two new wells that Denbury, the operator of the Delhi Field, is currently drilling. See Drilling and Present Activities below for a further discussion of our expected development of the PUDs for the Williston Basin properties. Drilling and Present Activities Currently, none of our oil and natural gas properties are operated by us. We therefore rely on information from our operators regarding near-term drilling programs. As certain of our properties are considered fully developed, there are no plans to drill new wells in fiscal year 2024 in the Jonah Field, the Barnett Shale, and the Hamilton Dome Field. At this time, operators of our properties at Williston Basin, Hamilton Dome Field and Delhi Field are periodically running workover rigs focusing on projects to return wells to production that have experienced mechanical issues. At Delhi Field, the third-party operator, Denbury, is currently drilling two new down dip wells in the field. Completion and first production of these wells are expected in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Denbury is also evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of development of Test Site V. Should they choose to propose proceeding with this project, we anticipate being an active participant based on our current analysis of the project. As of June 30, 2023, Test Site V is not included in our proved reserves due to timing. For fiscal year 2024, at the Williston Basin, we are evaluating drilling two sidetrack locations targeting the Birdbear formation with our operator, Foundation. Efforts to continue evaluating other sidetrack locations and undeveloped drilling locations at the Williston Basin is ongoing. For further discussion, see Capital Expenditures within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations .

(2) This table excludes acreage attributable to small overriding royalty interests retained in various formations in the Texas Giddings Field area. Except for de minimis production that began on two leases during late fiscal year 2019, none of such acreage is currently producing and our interests are subject to expiration if leases are not maintained by others or commercial production is not established. It does not currently appear likely that we will obtain any significant value from these interests and no reserves have been assigned to any of the Giddings interests.

Markets and Customers Our production is marketed to third parties in a manner consistent with industry practices. In the United States market where our properties are operated, crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are readily transportable and marketable. In the

Table of Contents 
 Jonah Field, we take our natural gas and NGL working interest production in-kind and market separately to purchasers on six-month contracts for natural gas and to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. for NGLs. We do not currently market our share of oil, natural gas, or NGLs production from the Williston Basin, the Barnett Shale, the Hamilton Dome Field, or the Delhi Field separately from the operators shares of production. Although we have the right to take our working interest production in-kind, we are currently selling our production through the field operators pursuant to the delivery and pricing terms of their sales contracts. Under such arrangements, we typically do not know the identity of the buyers. As a non-operator, we are highly dependent on the success of our third-party operators and the decisions made in connection with their operations. With the exception of the Jonah Field, our third-party operators sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs to purchasers, collect the cash, and distribute the cash to us. In the year ended June 30, 2023, approximately 83 of our total revenues were realized from the Jonah Field, Barnett Shale and Delhi Field combined. Diversified, our largest operator at Barnett remitted approximately 26 of our total revenue proceeds to us and at Delhi Field, Denbury, the operator of the Field, remitted approximately 22 of our total revenue proceeds to us. At Jonah Field, where we take our natural gas and NGL production in-kind, during the current year, we sold approximately 17 of our total revenues to Conoco Phillips. In the year ended June 30, 2022, three operators each distributed over 10 of our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues making up approximately 83 of total revenues for the year. The loss of a purchaser at any of our five major producing properties or disruption to pipeline transportation from these fields could adversely affect our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels. Market Conditions Prices we receive for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, the exact effect of which is difficult to predict. These factors include changes in supply and demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, government regulation, weather, and actions of major foreign producers. Oil and natural gas prices over the past few years have been volatile and we expect that volatility to continue. Worldwide factors such as global health pandemics, geopolitical, international trade disruptions and tariffs, macroeconomics, supply and demand, refining capacity, petrochemical production, and derivatives trading, among others, influence prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Local and domestic factors also influence prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs and include increasing or decreasing production trends, quality differences, regulation, legislation and transportation issues unique to certain producing regions and reservoirs. Competition The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive for prospects, acreage, and capital. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, numerous independent oil and natural gas companies, individuals, and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staff and greater capital resources. Competitors are national, regional, or local in scope and compete on the basis of financial resources, technical prowess or local knowledge. The principal competitive factors in our industry are expertise in given geographical areas and geologic systems and the ability to efficiently conduct operations, achieve technological advantages, identify and acquire economically producible reserves, and obtain capital at rates that allow economic investments. Risk Management We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including commodity price risk. In accordance with our company policies and the covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, derivative instruments are occasionally utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. While there are many different types of derivative instruments available, historically we have used costless collars and fixed-price swaps to attempt to manage price risk. Costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement is below the floor. The fixed-price swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the fixed-price swap agreement. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. Our hedge strategies and objectives may change as our operational profile changes. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 7, Derivatives to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. Government Regulation As an oil and natural gas exploration and production company, our interests are subject to numerous legal requirements. Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production Federal, state and local authorities have promulgated extensive rules covering oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. Those regulations require our third-party operator to obtain permits, post bonds and submit reports. They also may address conservation, including unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, well locations, the method of drilling and casing wells, surface use and restoration of properties where wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the process of drilling, completion and abandonment, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can produce. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legal requirements may result in substantial penalties. Because such regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict future compliance costs or impacts. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations, however, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Regulation of Transportation of Oil and Natural Gas The prices for crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and natural gas are negotiated and not currently regulated. But Congress, which has been active in oil and natural gas regulation, could impose price controls in the future. Our sales of crude oil and natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC primarily regulates interstate oil and natural gas transportation rates. In some circumstances, FERC regulations also may affect intrastate pipelines. In addition, states may impose on intrastate pipelines various obligations relating to such matters as safety, environmental protection, nondiscriminatory take and pay rates. The basis for intrastate oil and natural gas pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to such matters, vary from state to state. To the extent effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil and natural gas transportation rates will not affect our business in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated. Environmental Matters Our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker safety and human health. Such requirements may address: the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and disposal of materials; reclamation or remediation of sites, including former operating areas; the acquisition of a permit or other authorization; 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 air emissions; protection of water supplies; limits on construction, drilling and other activities in wilderness or other environmentally sensitive areas; and assessment of environmental impacts. Failure to comply with such requirements may result in a variety of sanctions, including fines, administrative orders and injunctions. In addition, issuing authorities may revoke, adversely condition or deny permits necessary for our operations. In the opinion of management, our properties are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Significant environmental requirements that may affect our operations are described below. The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA and comparable state statutes impose strict liability, and in some cases joint and several liability, on owners and operators of sites and on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners or other third parties to also file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by any hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substance, our operations do entail handling other chemicals that may be subject to the statute. In addition, state laws affecting our properties may impose cleanup liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste. Violations may result in substantial fines. Although RCRA currently classifies certain oil field wastes as non-hazardous, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous, thereby subjecting our operations to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. In some circumstances, moreover, RCRA authorizes both the federal government and private persons to seek injunctions requiring the cleanup of wastes, whether hazardous or non-hazardous. The Endangered Species Act ESA protects fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the ESA, exploration and production operations may not significantly impair or jeopardize a protected species or its habitat. The ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations. Our operations also may be subject to other statutes that protect animals and plants such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Although we believe that our properties are in compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company (directly or indirectly through our third-party operators) to significant expenses to modify operations, could force discontinuation of certain operations altogether and could limit the locations our third-party operators may utilize in the future. The Clean Air Act CAA is the comprehensive federal law addressing sources of air emissions. Oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations are among the many source categories subject to the CAA. Regulated emissions from oil and natural gas operations include sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds VOCs and hazardous air pollutants such as benzene, among others. In particular, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued proposed CAA regulations in November 2021, which it strengthened and expanded in November 2022, that would impose more comprehensive restrictions on emissions of methane (a greenhouse gas) and VOCs from new, existing and modified facilities in the oil and gas sector. Among other things, EPA s proposed new rule would require states to implement plans that meet or exceed established emission reduction guidelines for oil and natural gas facilities. These regulations and proposals and any other new regulations requiring the installation of more sophisticated pollution control equipment could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Clean Water Act (the CWA is the primary federal law controlling the discharge of produced waters and other pollutants into waters of the United States. Permits must be obtained for such discharges and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Some states also require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater. 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 The CAA, CWA and comparable state statutes authorize civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations. Further, the CWA and Oil Pollution Act may impose liability on owners or operators of onshore facilities that impact surface waters. Pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA (or an authorized state) regulates the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells used to place oil and natural gas wastes and other fluids underground for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, storage or disposal. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. Underground injection associated with oil and gas operations, particularly the disposal of produced water, has been linked in some cases to localized earthquakes. This in turn has led to new legislative and regulatory initiatives, which have the potential to restrict injection in certain wells or limit operations in certain areas. Certain of the oil and natural gas production in which we have an interest is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection into the formation of water, sand and chemicals under pressure to stimulate production. From time to time, legislation has been proposed in the United States Congress to repeal the Safe Drinking Water Act s exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing. If ever enacted, such legislation would add to costs for hydraulic fracturing. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. Several states where our properties are located have proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing. A number of municipalities likewise have enacted bans on hydraulic fracturing. We cannot predict whether any other legislation restricting hydraulic fracturing will be enacted and if so, what its provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were to be required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level, it could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. The National Environmental Policy Act NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions. Among the broad range of actions covered by NEPA are decisions on permit applications and federal land management. Many of the activities of our third-party operators involve federal decisions subject to NEPA. Such federal actions may trigger robust NEPA review, which could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In 2022, moreover, the Biden Administration reversed changes to NEPA rules enacted under the Trump Administration that had been intended to streamline NEPA review. The revised regulations lay the foundation for additional scrutiny of impacts on climate change, which could affect the assessment of projects ranging from oil and gas leasing to development on public and Indian lands. Climate Change Climate change has become a major public concern and policy issue in the United States and around the world. Much of the debate has focused on greenhouse gas GHG emissions from oil and natural gas, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. In the United States, there is no comprehensive federal regulatory statute addressing climate change, although Congress does periodically consider such measures. At the federal level, the United States therefore has primarily addressed climate change through executive actions and regulatory initiatives pursuant to existing statutes. These include rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Biden Administration s commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 50-52 percent of 2005 levels, various executive orders, limiting land available for oil and gas leasing, the United States Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan (intended to reduce overall methane emissions by 30 below 2020 levels by 2030), and Clean Air Act rules (such as the November 2021 proposal to regulate methane from the oil and gas sector). In addition, several states have already implemented or are considering programs to reduce GHG emissions. These include cap and trade programs, promotion of alternative forms of energy, transportation standards and restrictions

 on particular GHGs. To the extent that new climate change measures are adopted, and our third-party operators must further control GHG emissions, our business may be adversely impacted. In addition, recent court decisions have left open the question of whether tort claims alleging property damage may proceed against sources of GHG emissions under state common law. Thus, there is some litigation risk for such claims. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources, for example, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. But in 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act that, among other things, creates a series of financial incentives intended to discourage use of oil and natural gas (including imposing a fee on methane emissions) and to promote alternative sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products may become less desirable in the market with such government intervention. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations. Various studies on climate change indicate that extreme weather conditions and other risks may occur in the future in the areas where we operate. Although we have not experienced any material impact from such extreme conditions to date, no assurance can be given that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business in the future. See discussion captioned Government regulation and liability for oil and natural gas operations and environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors . Insurance We maintain insurance on our oil and natural gas properties and operations for risks and in amounts customary in the industry. Such insurance includes, but is not limited to, general liability, excess liability, control of well, operators extra expense, casualty, fraud, and directors and officer s liability coverage. Not all losses are insured, and we retain certain risks of loss through deductibles, limits, and self-retentions. We do not carry business interruption or lost profits coverage. Human Capital, Sustainability, and ESG Employees As of June 30, 2023, we had eleven full-time employees, not including contract personnel and outsourced service providers. Due to our current focus on non-operating properties, our staff is disproportionately weighted towards higher wage professionals. We believe that we have positive relations with our employees. Our team is broadly experienced in oil and natural gas operations, development, acquisitions, and financing. We follow a strategy of outsourcing most of our property accounting, human resources, administrative, and other non-core functions. For our full-time employees, our benefits package, as determined by our Board of Directors, includes medical, dental, and vision insurance, short-term disability, 401(k) contributions based on a portion of the employee s base salary, short and long-term performance-based and service-based incentive pay (i.e., annual bonuses and stock awards), and paid time off. Our workforce is provided with annual training and is expected to sign an acknowledgement regarding our policies and disclosures which include, but are not limited to, the Corporate Sustainability Report CSR ), employee handbook, human rights, code of ethics, health and safety, emergency procedures, conflicts of interest, insider trading, bribery, kickbacks, discrimination, diversity, equality, and inclusion. Sustainability and ESG In fiscal year 2023, we formed a Sustainability Committee which is responsible for overseeing our Environmental Social Governance ESG initiatives. In fiscal year 2021-2022, under the supervision of our Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance committee, and senior management, the foundation of our sustainability efforts

 and CSR were led by an ESG Task Force. Evolution s most recent CSR was published in October 2022. This report is accessible on our website at www.evolutionpetroleum.com. The ESG Task Force formalized our existing ESG programs, proposed and implemented new ESG initiatives, monitored adherence to our internal and third-party sustainability standards, and provided public disclosures for our stakeholders. Each year, we continue to disclose, enhance, implement, and provide training for a number of new and existing policies and procedures. These include, but are not limited to: implementing a charitable donation program and employee volunteer initiative, an annual company-wide ESG training program for both the Board of Directors and our workforce, implementation of safety inspections and health and safety coordinators, and incorporating ESG considerations into our compensation structure. We are committed to high standards of conduct and ethics in order to contribute to the sustainability of our business. Our core values are the base to support our strategy and long-term success. We believe integrity is paramount and we are committed to developing and producing energy resources in environmentally, socially, and ethically respectful and responsible ways. Our people are critical to our success and as such we promote and maintain a safe and inclusive work environment. We strategically plan for the long-term and strive to maintain capital discipline, stakeholder transparency, and continuous focus on returning capital to shareholders. We work with third-party operators that share our desire to operate and work responsibly, particularly for the natural environments in which they operate. Denbury Inc., the operator of our Delhi Field property, is an industry leader in Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage with a network of CO 2 EOR operations and the United States largest operated system of CO 2 transmission pipelines. As of year-end 2022, Denbury reportedly injects over three million tons of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 annually, and has a goal to reach Net Zero for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 CO 2 emissions by 2030, primarily through increasing the amount of captured industrial-sourced CO 2 used in their operations. Jonah Energy, the operator of our Jonah Field property, is one of the leading sustainable natural gas producers in the U.S. In 2021, Jonah was the first and only U.S. company to achieve the Gold Standard Rating, announced by the United Nations Environment Programme International Methane Emissions Observatory. As a non-operator of our current properties, we do not have direct control over environmental initiatives at a property-level. However, we believe it is important to partner with third-party operators that share our core values and are committed to being environmental stewards as they responsibly produce energy resources. We recognize that the expectations, requirements, and responsibilities of operators regarding safeguarding the environment and environmental stewardship continue to evolve. We are, and will continue to be, committed to supporting our third-party operators as they respond to these expectations, requirements, and responsibilities. In fiscal year 2023, we implemented our first annual voluntary Environmental Operator Questionnaire to collect various environmental metrics on behalf of our third-party operators. In addition, we host regular operations meetings with our third-party operators in which we discuss asset level operations, expenses, any environmental issues and compliance, including ESG and health and safety related topics. We do not report Scope 1 GHG, or direct, emissions to the EPA as we are not the operator of our properties, nor do we have financial control over our oil and natural gas properties and operations. We prefer to partner with third-party operators that work to reduce their Scope 1 GHG emissions, and we encourage them to accelerate their efforts as appropriate in this regard. The Company reports in its CSR the estimated Scope 2 GHG emissions for its corporate office located in Houston, Texas. Scope 2 GHG emissions are based on indirect emissions representing purchased electricity. We are one of many tenants leasing space in our corporate office building and do not know the actual amount of electricity used in our space. As such, we estimate our consumption by multiplying the electricity purchased for the entire building by the percentage of the floor area that we occupy. Water use is also reported in the CSR and is calculated in a similar fashion. We maintain a hotline which operates 24/7/365 and allows anonymous and confidential reporting for employees, consultants, partners, and contractors, including the ability to report concerns or violations of our policies through the phone or internet (Phone: 877-628-7489 / Website: www.epm.alertline.com).

Risk Factors Our business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. Risks Related to Our Business: A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas significantly influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital, capital spending, and future rate of growth. At June 30, 2023, approximately 32 of our proved reserves were oil reserves, 49 were natural gas and 19 were NGLs. Oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas, and NGLs have been volatile and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to the following: changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;
 worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;
 social unrest, political instability or armed conflict in major oil and natural gas producing regions outside the United States, such as the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;
 the ability and willingness of the members of OPEC+ to agree and maintain oil price and production controls;
 the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;
 governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions; 
 the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies;
 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;
 the level of global oil and natural gas inventories;
 localized supply and demand fundamentals of regional, domestic, and international transportation availability;
 weather conditions, natural disasters, and seasonal trends;
 domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including embargoes, sanctions, tariffs, and environmental regulations;
 speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;
 price and availability of competitors supplies of oil and natural gas;
 technological advances affecting energy consumption; 
 increasing attention to ESG matters; and

 the price, availability and use of alternative fuels.
 Substantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12-month) contracts at market-based prices. A decline in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices will reduce our cash flows, borrowing ability, the present value of our reserves, and our ability to develop future reserves. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms. Low oil, natural gas, and NGL prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas, and NGL that we can produce economically, which could lead to a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Generally, we hedge substantially less than all of our anticipated oil and natural gas production and typically only with the requirements of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. To the extent that we have not hedged production, any significant and extended decline in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices may adversely affect our financial position. Our existing developed oil and natural gas production will decline; we may be unable to acquire or develop the additional oil and natural gas reserves that are required in order to sustain our production and business operations. The volume of production from developed oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Environmental issues, operating problems, or lack of extended future investment in any of our properties would cause our net production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs to decline significantly over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The types of resources we focus on have substantial operational risks. Our business plan focuses on the acquisition and development of known resources in partially depleted, naturally fractured, or low permeability reservoirs. Our Hamilton Dome Field and Delhi Field properties produce from relatively shallow reservoirs, while our Jonah Field, Williston Basin and Barnett Shale properties produce from deeper reservoirs. Shallower reservoirs usually have lower pressure, which generally translates into lower reserves volumes in place. Deeper reservoirs have higher pressures and usually more reserves volumes in place, but capturing those reserves often comes at increased drilling and completion costs and risks and, generally, a higher rate of initial production decline. Low permeability reservoirs require substantial stimulation for development of commercial production. Naturally fractured reservoirs require penetration of sufficient un-depleted fractures to establish commercial production. Depleted reservoirs require successful application of newer, or more expensive, technologies to produce incremental reserves. Our approach on the development and application of technologies on these different types of reservoirs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The CO 2 -EOR project in the Delhi Field, operated by Denbury, requires significant amounts of CO 2 reserves, development capital, and technical expertise, the sources of which to date have been committed by the operator. On July 13, 2023, Exxon Mobil Corporation Exxon announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Denbury. Exxon s plans with respect to the Delhi Field are unknown. Additional capital remains to be invested to fully develop the EOR project and maximize the value of the properties. The operator s failure to manage these and other technical, environmental, operational, strategic, financial, and logistical risks may ultimately cause enhanced recoveries from the planned CO 2 -EOR project to fall short of our expectations in volume and/or timing. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. All of our property interests are operated by third-party working interest owners, not by us. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operations or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety, and other standards, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Operators of these properties may act in ways that are not in our best interest. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, result in lower production, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

 We will be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions. We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects, leaseholds, and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including, but not limited to: recoverable reserves; future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials; development and operating costs; potential for future drilling and production; validity of the seller s title to properties, which may be less than expected at closing; and potential environmental issues, litigation, and other liabilities. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable at the ground surface or otherwise when an inspection is performed. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Moreover, in the event of such an acquisition, there is a risk that we could ultimately be liable for unknown obligations related to acquisitions and, importantly, that our assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, differentials, reserves, or production could prove materially inaccurate and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We may encounter difficulties integrating the operations of newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses. Increasing our reserve base through acquisitions has been an important part of our business strategy. We may encounter difficulties integrating newly acquired oil and natural gas properties or businesses. In particular, we may face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel, and business operations in an effective manner. The failure to successfully integrate such properties or businesses into our Company may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any acquisition we make may involve numerous risks, including: a significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements; the inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets; the incurrence of substantial costs to address unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets; liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets before our acquisition; our lack of drilling or operational history in the areas in which the acquired business operates; customer or key employee loss from the acquired business; increased administration of new personnel; additional costs due to increased scope and complexity of our business; potential disruption of our ongoing business; and assumptions made on estimated development by the operator may not be accurate or may change. Additionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. To the extent that we acquire properties substantially different from the properties we currently own or that require different technical expertise, we may not be able to realize the economic benefits of these acquisitions as effectively as with acquisitions within our current footprint and expertise. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisition we may make.

 Oil and natural gas development, re-completion of wells from one reservoir to another reservoir, restoring wells to production, and drilling and completing new wells are speculative activities which involve numerous risks and substantial uncertain costs. Our growth will be partially dependent upon the success of future development programs on our properties. Drilling for oil and natural gas and extracting NGLs and re-working existing wells involve numerous risks. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is substantial and uncertain; drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to: unexpected drilling conditions; pressure fluctuations or irregularities in reservoir formations; equipment failures or accidents; well blowouts and other releases of hazardous materials; inability to obtain or maintain leases on economic terms, where applicable; the cost and availability of goods and services, such as drilling rigs, fracture stimulation services, and tubulars; adverse weather conditions; compliance with governmental requirements; and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment. Drilling or re-working is a highly speculative activity. Even when fully and correctly utilized, modern well completion and production techniques, such as Horizontal Drilling or CO 2 injection, do not guarantee that we will find and produce oil and/or natural gas in economic quantities. Our future drilling, completion and production activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure would have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. We may also identify and develop prospects through a number of methods, some of which may include Horizontal Drilling or tertiary injectants, and some of which may be unproven. The drilling and results for these prospects may be particularly uncertain. We cannot ensure that these projects can be successfully developed or that wells will, if drilled, encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas. Our oil and natural gas reserves are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their estimated values. Our reserves are only estimates that may prove to be inaccurate because of these inherent uncertainties. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot always be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves depend upon a number of variable factors. These factors include historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas, assumptions concerning effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future oil and natural gas product prices, future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs, workover costs, and remedial costs. Some or all of these assumptions utilized in estimating reserve volumes may vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of reserves, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from reserves may vary substantially depending on the timing and different engineers preparing reserves estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustments. Actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates; such variances may be material. The information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on the 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, increases or decreases in consumption, and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. In addition, the 10 discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. Interest rates in effect vary from time to time based on risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. The Standardized Measure does not necessarily correspond to market value. Regulatory and accounting requirements may require substantial reductions in reporting proven reserves. On a periodic basis, we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the applicable rules of various regulatory agencies, including the SEC. Under the full cost method of accounting that we use, the after-tax carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net after-tax cash flows from proved reserves, discounted at 10 . Application of this ceiling test requires pricing future revenues at the previous 12-month average beginning-of-month price and requires a write-down of the carrying value for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded. We may in the future be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile. Whether we will be required to take such a charge will depend in part on the prices of oil and natural gas during the previous period and the effect of reserve additions or revisions and capital expenditures during such period. If a write-down is required, it would result in a current charge to our earnings but would not impact our current cash flow from operating activities. A large write-down could adversely affect our compliance with the current financial covenants under our credit facility, could limit our access to future borrowings under that facility, or require repayment of any amounts that might be outstanding at the time. Our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income. Under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to hedge a certain portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for future periods when we reach a defined utilization percentage. We may also elect to hedge additional production volumes from time to time based upon our view of the attractiveness of commodity futures and the risks that downward price fluctuations might pose to our business plans. When we engage in hedging transactions, we may utilize costless collars, fixed price swaps or purchased floors to cost-effectively provide us with some protection against price changes. We have not historically designated any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our future derivative instruments. Derivative arrangements may also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including, but not limited to, if: actual production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments; the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations; or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual price received. In addition, in a rising commodity price environment, derivative arrangements may limit the extent to which we might benefit from increases in prices of oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements. Our operations may require significant amounts of capital and additional financing may be necessary in order for us to continue our exploitation activities. Cash flow from our production may not be sufficient to fund our ongoing activities at all times. From time to time, we may require additional financing in order to carry out oil and natural gas acquisitions, exploitation, and development activities. If our revenues decrease as a result of decreases in production, lower oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, it will affect our ability to expend the necessary capital to replace our reserves or to maintain our current production. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or be available to us on favorable terms.

 Government regulation and liability for oil and natural gas operations and environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local government regulations, which may change from time to time. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties, and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas from wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. There are federal, state, and local laws and regulations addressing protection of human health and the environment that apply to the development, production, handling, storage, and transportation of oil, natural gas, and their by-products; the disposal of related wastes; the emission of CO 2 , other greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds; and the management of other substances and materials released, produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations. These laws and regulations may affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations by, among other things, requiring us to make significant expenditures in order to comply and restricting the areas available for oil and gas production. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial liabilities to third-parties or governmental entities. In addition, we may be liable for significant environmental damages and cleanup costs, without regard to fault, for releases of hazardous materials on or from property we own or operate, even if we did not cause or contribute to the release. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted. The implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on us, such as by imposing new emission controls, penalties, fines and/or fees, taxes and tariffs on carbon that could have the effect of raising prices to the end user and thereby reducing the demand for our products. The risks arising out of the threat of climate change, including transition risks and physical risks, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. The threat of climate change poses both transition risks and physical risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. Transition risks may arise from political and regulatory, legal, technological or financial changes as society tries to safeguard the climate, while physical risks may result from extreme weather events or other shifts in the natural world. We have been facing increased political and regulatory risks as federal, state and local governments have adopted new measures to restrict sources of greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy alternatives. Many such measures have been proposed, and still more can be expected. From time to time, there are proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and to remove more lands, both onshore and offshore, from new hydrocarbon production. Many other actions could be pursued such as more rigorous requirements for drilling and construction permits, stricter greenhouse gas emissions standards for both new and existing sources, further limits on construction of new pipelines, reinstatement of the ban on oil exports, enhanced reporting obligations, taxing carbon emissions and creating further incentives for use of alternative energy sources. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens. Litigation risks are also increasing for oil and natural gas companies. A number of suits alleging, among other things, that oil and natural gas companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change have been brought in state or federal court. Technological changes may drive market demand for products other than oil and natural gas. Wider adoption of hybrid engines and electric cars, for example, would reduce demand for our products. At the same time, our capital and operating costs may increase if we need to add new emission reduction technologies. There are also financial risks for the petroleum industry. It may become more difficult for us to access the capital markets if the threat of climate change discourages new investment. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for the energy industry could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.

 The threat of climate change also may subject our operations and business to severe weather or other natural hazards, such as flooding, drought, wildfires, and extreme temperatures. Any such event could halt production or exploration activities, damage equipment, disrupt transportation, reduce consumer demand and significantly increase our costs. Poor general economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. During the last few years, concerns over inflation, energy costs, volatile oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market, uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, the slowdown in economic growth in large emerging and developing markets, such as China, regional or worldwide increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions, and other issues have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on domestic and international financial markets and commodity prices. If uncertain or poor economic, business, or industry conditions in the United States or abroad remain prolonged, demand for petroleum products could diminish or stagnate, and production costs could increase. These situations could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs, affect our vendors , suppliers , and customers ability to continue operations, and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Events outside of our control, including a pandemic or broad outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the global outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus COVID-19 ), may materially adversely affect our business. We face risks related to pandemics, outbreaks, or other public health events that are outside of our control and could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. In December 2019, COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread around the world. This virus and its variants, and governmental actions to contain it, had material adverse economic impacts globally. These and other actions could, among other things, impact the ability of our employees and contractors to perform their duties, cause increased technology and security risk due to extended and company-wide telecommuting, and lead to disruptions in our permitting activities and critical business relationships. Additionally, governmental restrictions intended to contain COVID-19 or future pandemics have in the past, and may in the future, significantly impact economic activity and markets and dramatically reduce actual or anticipated demand for oil and natural gas, adversely impacting the prices we receive for our production. The severity and duration of any such events are uncertain and difficult to predict, as is the extent that such events may have on our business. Our business could be negatively affected by security threats. A cyber-attack or similar incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation, and/or financial loss. The oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing, and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, manage operations, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third-party operators. Our technologies, systems, networks, seismic data, reserves information, or other proprietary information, and those of our operators, vendors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches. Cyber-attacks or information security breaches could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period and could lead to disruptions in critical systems or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, disruption of operations, damage to our reputation, or potential liability. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and natural gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad. Computers are necessary to transport our oil and natural gas production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and natural gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Cyber incidents have increased, and the United States government has issued warnings indicating that energy assets may be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our 
 21

 systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Our insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. The oil and natural gas business involves numerous operating hazards such as well blowouts, mechanical failures, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, hurricanes and storms, flooding, pollution, releases of toxic gas, and other environmental hazards and risks, which can result in (1) damage to or destruction of wells and/or production facilities, (2) damage to or destruction of formations, (3) injury to persons, (4) loss of life, or (5) damage to property, the environment or natural resources. While we carry general liability, control of well, and operator s extra expense coverage typical in our industry, we are not fully insured against all risks incidental to our business. Should we experience any losses, the costs of our premiums may rise, which could in turn reduce the amount of insurance we are able to carry. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect us. We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel, including our executive officers. The loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In particular, our future success is dependent upon the abilities of our executive officers to source, evaluate, and close deals, raise capital, and oversee our development activities and operations. Presently, we are not a beneficiary of any key man life insurance. Oilfield service and materials prices may increase, and the availability of such services and materials may be inadequate to meet our needs. Our business plan to develop or redevelop oil and natural gas resources requires third-party oilfield service vendors and various material providers, which we do not control. We also rely on third-party carriers for the transportation and distribution of our oil and natural gas production. As our production increases, so does our need for such services and materials. Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our service and materials providers. Accordingly, there is a risk that any of our service providers could discontinue providing services for any reason or we may not be able to source the services or materials we need. Any delay in locating, establishing relationships, and training our sources could result in production shortages and maintenance problems, resulting in loss of revenue to us. In addition, if costs for such services and materials increase, it may render certain or all of our projects uneconomic, as compared to the earlier prices we may have assumed when deciding to redevelop newly purchased or existing properties. Further adverse economic outcomes may result from the long lead times often necessary to execute and complete our redevelopment plans. We may assume risks and financial responsibility for drilling and completing wells on our Williston Basin properties if our third-party operator declines to drill wells and it or other joint interest owners elect not to participate. As discussed elsewhere in this report, pursuant to agreements related to our interests in the Williston Basin properties, we have the ability to propose to the operator a drilling plan for certain wells, which the operator may accept or reject. In the event the operator rejects our proposed drilling plan, we have the right to undertake all necessary activities to drill and complete the wells and related facilities in accordance with our proposed drilling plan. In the event we undertake to do so, and the operator and other joint interest owners elect not to participate, we will bear the entire liability and expense associated with drilling and completing the wells and related facilities, subject only to our right to recoup costs incurred on behalf of non-participating joint interest owners to the extent a well generates sufficient revenues to do so. We thus may be required to bear a share of such expenses to an extent that is disproportionate to our economic interest in the property. If we elect to proceed to drill and complete wells we have proposed and the operator has rejected, we also will bear many of the other risks highlighted elsewhere herein, including, without limitation, failing to find economic quantities of oil and natural gas, drilling accidents, potential environmental liabilities, unavailability of insurance at a reasonable cost to cover associated liabilities, and price increases and delivery delays for required drilling and completion equipment, products and services. Ongoing operations of any wells we elect to drill will be turned over to the operator of the property upon completion.

 We cannot market the oil and natural gas that we produce without the assistance of third-parties. The marketability of the oil and natural gas that we produce depends upon the proximity of our reserves and production to, and the capacity of, facilities and third-party services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and processing facilities necessary to make the products marketable for end use. The unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. A shut-in, delay, or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition. We face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, numerous larger independent oil and natural gas companies, individuals, and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources. We may not be able to successfully conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties, or consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Specifically, these larger competitors may be able to pay more for development projects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, such companies may be able to expend greater resources on hiring contract service providers, obtaining oilfield equipment, and acquiring the existing and changing technologies that we believe are, and will be, increasingly important to attaining success in our industry. We have been, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings related to our properties or operations and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings. From time to time we may be a defendant or plaintiff in various lawsuits. The nature of our operations exposes us to further possible litigation claims in the future. There is risk that any matter in litigation could be decided unfavorably against us regardless of our belief, opinion, and position, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Litigation can be very costly, and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Adverse litigation decisions or rulings may damage our business reputation. Ownership of our oil, natural gas, and mineral production depends on good title to our property. Good and clear title to our oil, natural gas, and mineral properties is important to our business. Although title reviews will generally be conducted prior to the purchase of most oil, natural gas, and mineral producing properties or the commencement of drilling wells, such reviews do not assure that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise to defeat our claim. This could result in a reduction or elimination of the revenue received by us from such properties. Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to tax by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; tax effects of stock-based compensation; costs related to intercompany restructurings; or changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof. For example, in previous years, legislation has been proposed to eliminate or defer certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions historically available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes have included: (1) a repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (2) the elimination of deductions for intangible drilling and exploration and development costs; (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain production activities; and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 expenditures. Under the current Administration there is an increased risk of the enactment of legislation that alters, eliminates, or defers these or other tax deductions utilized within the industry, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we may be subject to audits of its income, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Associated with our Common Stock Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. Our common stock has a relatively low trading volume and the market price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The variance in our stock price makes it difficult to forecast the stock price at which an investor may be able to buy or sell shares of our common stock. The market price for our common stock could be subject to fluctuations as a result of factors that are out of our control, such as: actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations; changes or fluctuations in the commodity prices of oil and natural gas; general conditions and trends in the oil and natural gas industry; redemption demands on institutional funds that hold our stock; and general economic, political, and market conditions. Significant ownership of our common stock is concentrated in a small number of shareholders who may be able to affect the outcome of the election of our directors and all other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. As of June 30, 2023, our executive officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 2,959,269 million shares, or approximately 8.9 of our outstanding common stock and, based on recent filings with the SEC, we believe one large unaffiliated fund complex owned in excess of 8 of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, a significant percentage of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of relatively few shareholders. These shareholders could potentially exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets). This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing any matter that requires shareholder approval, including a change in control of our company, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving our company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The market for our common stock is limited and may not provide adequate liquidity. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American. Trading volume in our common stock is relatively low compared to larger companies. Our holders may find it more difficult to sell their shares, should they desire to do so, based on the trading volume and price of our stock at that time relative to the quantity of shares to be sold. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. Small, relatively unknown companies can achieve visibility in the trading market through research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish. To our knowledge, only two research analysts actively cover our company. The limited number of published reports by securities analysts could limit the interest in our common stock and negatively affect our stock price. We do not have any control over the research and reports these analysts publish or whether they will be published at all. If any analyst who does cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could decline. If any 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 analyst ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Payment of dividends on our common stock has been in the past, and could be in the future, reduced or eliminated. Our Board of Directors declared cash dividends on our common stock for the first time in December 2013 and we have declared and paid quarterly cash dividends since that time. However, there is no certainty that dividends will be declared by our Board of Directors in the future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be dependent upon the amount of funds legally available, our earnings, if any, our financial condition, our business plan, restrictions contained in current or future debt instruments, contractual covenants or arrangements we may enter into, our anticipated capital requirements, and other factors that our Board of Directors may think are relevant. Although it is our intent to maintain paying dividends to our shareholders, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. There may be future sales or issuances of our common stock, which will dilute the ownership interests of stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We may in the future issue additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or substantially similar securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, our stockholders may be further diluted by future issuances under our equity incentive plans. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales or issuances of a large number of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after this offering or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur. Non-U.S. holders may be subject to U.S. income tax and withholding tax with respect to gain on disposition of the Company s common stock. We believe we are a U.S. real property holding corporation. As a result, Non-U.S. holders that own (or are treated as owning under constructive ownership rules) more than a specified amount of our common stock during a specified time period may be subject to U.S. federal income tax and withholding on a sale, exchange or other disposition of such common stock, and may be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return. Investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels, sustainability, and other ESG matters could adversely affect our business and our stock price. There have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other groups, to promote the divestment of shares of fossil fuel companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with fossil fuel companies. As a result, some financial intermediaries, investors, and other capital markets participants have reduced or ceased lending to, or investing in, companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure, such as the oil and natural gas industry. For example, in December 2020, the State of New York announced that it will be divesting the state s Common Retirement Fund from fossil fuels. If this or similar divestment efforts are continued, the price of our common stock or debt securities, and our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain new investment or financing, may be negatively impacted. Members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to greenhouse gases and climate change in the energy industry in particular, and diversity and inclusion initiatives and governance standards among companies more generally. The SEC, for example, proposed new rules in 2022 that would require disclosure of various specific risks related to climate. The growing emphasis on ESG may lead the investment community to screen our ESG performance before investing in our common stock or debt securities or lending to us. Over the past few years there also has been an acceleration in investor demand for ESG investing opportunities, and many large institutional investors have committed to increasing the percentage of their portfolios that are allocated towards ESG-focused investments. As a result, there has been a proliferation of ESG-focused investment funds seeking ESG-oriented investment products.

 If we are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment or lending criteria set by these investors and funds, we may lose investors, investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, our cost of capital may increase, the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted, and our reputation may be negatively affected.

 (1) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, no shares were purchased under the share repurchase program, discussed further below. All of the shares listed in the table above were surrendered by employees in exchange for the payment of tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock awards. (2) On September 8, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of its common stock in the open market through December 31, 2024. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company s shares, the market price of the Company s common stock, our capital needs and resources, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by the Company s Board of Directors does not require the Company to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In December 2022, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan that authorizes a broker to repurchase shares in the open market subject to pre-defined limitations on trading volume and price. The plan included a 30-day cooling off period that did not allow repurchases to commence until January 2023. The plan was effective until June 30, 2023 and had a maximum authorized amount of 5.0 million over that period. We may enter into additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future, the terms of which will be approved by the Board of Directors.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview Liquidity and Capital Resources Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Executive Overview General Evolution Petroleum Corporation is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. In support of that objective, our long-term goal is to maximize total shareholder return from a diversified portfolio of long-life oil and natural gas properties built through acquisitions and through selective development opportunities, production enhancements, and other exploitation efforts on our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties consist of non-operated interests in the Jonah Field in Sublette County, Wyoming, a natural gas producing field; non-operated interests in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, a producing oil and natural gas property; non-operated interests in the Barnett Shale located in North Texas, a natural gas producing property; non-operated interests in the Hamilton Dome Field located in Hot Springs County, Wyoming, a secondary recovery field utilizing water injection wells to pressurize the reservoir; non-operated interests in the Delhi Holt-Bryant Unit in the Delhi Field in Northeast Louisiana, a CO 2 enhanced oil recovery EOR project; and small overriding royalty interests in four onshore central Texas wells. Our non-operated interests in the Jonah Field, a natural gas and NGL property in Sublette County, Wyoming, consist of approximately 20 average net working interest and approximately 15 average net revenue interest located on approximately 950 net acres. The properties are operated by Jonah Energy, an established operator in the geographic region. Our non-operated interests in the Williston Basin, an oil and natural gas producing property, consist of approximately 39 average net working interest and approximately 33 average net revenue interest located on approximately 43,300 net acres (approximately 92 held by production) across Billings, Golden Valley, and McKenzie Counties in North Dakota. The properties are operated by Foundation Energy Management, an established operator in the geographic region. Our non-operated interests in the Barnett Shale, a natural gas and NGL producing shale reservoir, consist of approximately 17 average net working interest and approximately 14 average net revenue interest (inclusive of small overriding royalty interests). The approximately 21,000 net acres are held by production across nine North Texas counties. The oil and natural gas properties are primarily operated by Diversified Energy Company with approximately 10 of wells operated by six other operators. Our non-operated interests in the Hamilton Dome Field, a secondary recovery field utilizing water injection wells to pressurize the reservoir, consist of approximately 24 average net working interest, with an associated 20 average net revenue interest (inclusive of a small overriding royalty interest). The approximately 5,900 gross acre unitized field, of which we hold approximately 1,400 net acres, is operated by Merit Energy Company, who owns the vast majority of the remaining working interest in the Hamilton Dome Field. The Hamilton Dome Field is located in the southwest region of the Big Horn Basin in northwest Wyoming. Our non-operated interests in the Delhi Field, a CO 2 -EOR project, consist of approximately 24 average net working interest, with an associated 19 revenue interest and separate overriding royalty and mineral interests of approximately

Table of Contents 
 7 yielding a total average net revenue interest of approximately 26 . The field is operated by Denbury Onshore LLC. The Delhi Field is located in northeast Louisiana in Franklin, Madison, and Richland Parishes and encompasses approximately 14,000 gross unitized acres, or approximately 3,200 net acres. Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On September 11, 2023, Evolution s Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly dividend of 0.12 per common share payable September 29, 2023. Senior Secured Credit Facility On May 5, 2023, we entered into the Tenth Amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which has a current borrowing base of 50.0 million. This amendment, among other things, extends the maturity of our Senior Secured Credit Facility to April 9, 2026 and converts our benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.05 . For further discussion of the amendment and our Senior Secured Credit Facility, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Appointment of Chief Operating Officer On February 23, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors appointed J. Mark Bunch as COO . Mr. Bunch had been providing consulting services to the Company since 2016 . We entered into an offer letter with Mr. Bunch setting forth his compensation as COO on February 21, 2023. Appointment of Chief Executive Officer On October 27, 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors selected Kelly W. Loyd as President and CEO. Mr. Loyd had been serving as Interim CEO since June 2022 and has served as a member of the Board of Directors since 2008. We entered into an offer letter with Mr. Loyd setting forth his compensation as CEO on October 25, 2022. Upon commencing employment, Mr. Loyd no longer receives compensation for his services as a member of the Board of Directors. Share Repurchase Program On September 8, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of our common stock in the open market through December 31, 2024. We intend to fund repurchases from available working capital and cash provided by operating activities. As we continue to focus on our goal of maximizing total shareholder return, the Board of Directors and management team believe that a share repurchase program is complimentary to the existing dividend policy and is a tax efficient means to further improve shareholder return. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of our shares, our capital needs and resources, the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by our Board of Directors does not require us to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Once we completed repayment of borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility and emerged from our blackout period in December 2022, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan that authorized a broker to repurchase shares in the open market subject to pre-defined limitations on trading volume and price. The plan included a 30-day cooling off period that did not allow repurchases to commence until January 2023. The plan was effective until June 30, 2023 and had a 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 maximum authorized amount of 5.0 million over that period. During the year ended June 30, 2023, 0.6 million shares of our common stock were repurchased under the plan at a total cost of approximately 3.9 million, including incremental direct transaction costs. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled. We may enter into additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future, the terms of which will be approved by the Board of Directors. Proved Reserves The following table is a summary of our proved reserves as of June 30, 2023 and 2022: 

Proved Reserves 2023 2022 Change Proved Reserves MMBOE 31.2 36.2 (13.8) Developed 88.1 90.1 (2.0) Liquids 50.5 50.8 (0.3) Standardized Measure MM) 238.2 314.8 (24.3) Proved oil equivalent reserves as of June 30, 2023 were 31.2 MMBOE, a 5.0 MMBOE, or 13.8 , decrease from the previous year of 36.2 MMBOE. The net decrease in total proved reserves was primarily due production of 2.6 MMBOE and net negative revisions of 2.6 MMBOE partially offset by additions and extensions of 0.1 MMBOE. Net negative revisions of 2.6 MMBOE are primarily due to declines in SEC trailing 12-month pricing that impacted late-in-life economic limits of production, adjustment to projections and increased production costs partially offset by restored production at Hamiton Dome Field and improved economics from our differentials at Jonah Field. The Standardized Measure for proved reserves decreased 24.3 to 238.2 million, primarily due to sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced during the period, decreases in reserves estimates, decreases in the SEC mandated trailing 12-month average first day of the month prices for oil and natural gas and the price received for our NGLs. Prices decreased from 85.82 per barrel of oil, 5.19 per MMBtu of natural gas and 44.24 per barrel of NGLs at June 30, 2022 to 83.23 per barrel of oil, 4.78 per MMBtu of natural gas and 33.71 per barrel of NGLs at June 30, 2023. Our proved reserves consist of 32 oil, 49 natural gas, and 19 NGLs; 88.1 are classified as proved developed producing and 11.9 are proved undeveloped. Additional property and project information is included under Item 1. Business and in Note 4, Property and Equipment and our Supplemental Disclosure about Oil and Natural Gas Properties (unaudited) to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , and in Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2 of this Form 10-K. Risks and uncertainties The global economy was deeply impacted by the effects of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and related efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease. These events led to crude oil prices falling to historic lows during the second quarter of 2020 and remaining depressed through much of 2020. Beginning in 2021, the demand for oil and natural gas started to recover primarily as a result of the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine and lessening of pandemic related government restrictions on individuals and businesses. In addition, the military activities of Russia into Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Russia and other actions have created significant market uncertainties, including uncertainties around potential supply disruptions for oil and natural gas, which further enhanced volatility in global commodity prices in the first half of 2022. Additionally, in March 2023, the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and their placement into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC created broad uncertainty around world-wide financial institutions and liquidity risk. While we do not have exposure to these banks, we do maintain cash balances in excess of FDIC insurance protections at banks we believe to be financially sound. We also utilize insured cash sweep deposits to maximize the amount of our cash that is protected by FDIC insurance. We also rely heavily on our third-party operators who manage their own liquidity with various financial institutions. 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 Given the dynamic nature of these events, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that these market conditions will persist; predict the broader impact of liquidity concerns around financial institutions; or the impact on the commodity prices that we realize. Currently, our oil and natural gas properties are operated by third-party operators and involve other third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence the operation or future development of such properties. Despite these uncertainties, we remain focused on our long-term objectives and continue to be proactive with our third-party operators to review capital expenditures and present alternative plans as necessary. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility and 11.0 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to 21.3 million of borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility and 8.3 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during the year ended June 30, 2023 were cash provided by operations and the unused portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our primary uses of liquidity and capital resources for the year ended June 30, 2023 were repayments on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, cash dividend payments to our common stockholders, common stock repurchases, and capital expenditures on our existing oil and natural gas properties. As of June 30, 2023, working capital was 8.9 million, an increase of 2.8 million from working capital of 6.1 million as of June 30, 2022. The Senior Secured Credit Facility has a maximum capacity of 50.0 million subject to a borrowing base determined by the lender based on the value of our oil and natural gas properties. The Senior Secured Credit Facility has a current borrowing base of 50.0 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and matures on April 9, 2026. Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either the SOFR plus 2.80 or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus 1.0 . For the year ended June 30, 2023, the weighted average interest on our borrowings was 5.25 . The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, and (iii) a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 40.0 million, each as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. It also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a hedging covenant discussed below, and events of default. As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. On May 5, 2023, we entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment, among other things, extended the maturity of our Senior Secured Credit Facility to April 9, 2026, converted our benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.05 , and modified the Margined Collateral Value, as defined in the Ninth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, to 95.0 million. We are required to enter into hedges on a rolling 12-month basis when the borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility exceed 25 of the Margined Collateral Value. The required amount of hedged oil and natural gas production is related to the amount of borrowings outstanding. At each redetermination, our Margined Collateral Value takes into account the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties, proved developed reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. On February 7, 2022, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment, among other things, modified the definition of utilization percentage related to the required hedging covenant such that for the purposes of determining the amount of future production to hedge, the utilization of the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be based on the Margined Collateral Value, as amended above, to the extent it exceeds the borrowing base then in effect. This amendment also required us to enter into hedges for the 12-month period ending February 2023, covering 25 of expected oil and natural gas production over that period. On November 9, 2021, we entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment, among other things, increased the borrowing base to 50.0 million and added a hedging covenant whereby we must

 hedge a certain amount of our future production on a rolling 12-month basis when 25 or more of the borrowing base is utilized. The hedging covenant was amended in the Ninth Amendment, as discussed above. On August 5, 2021, we entered into the Seventh Amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facility which, among other things, added definitions for the terms Acquired Entity or Mineral Interests and Acquired Entity or Mineral Interests EBITDA Adjustment. Additionally, the consolidated tangible net worth covenant level was reduced to 40.0 million from 50.0 million. We have historically funded operations through cash from operations and working capital. Our primary source of cash is the sale of produced crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. A portion of these cash flows is used to fund capital expenditures and pay cash dividends to shareholders. We expect to fund near-future capital development activities for our properties with cash flows from operating activities and existing working capital. We are pursuing new growth opportunities through acquisitions and other transactions. In addition to cash on hand, we have access to the undrawn portion of the borrowing base available under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, totaling 50.0 million as of June 30, 2023. We also have an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC under which we may issue up to 500.0 million of new debt or equity securities. Our Board of Directors instituted a cash dividend on common stock in December 2013. We have since paid 39 consecutive quarterly dividends. Distribution of a substantial portion of free cash flow in excess of operating and capital requirements through cash dividends remains a priority of our financial strategy, and it is our long-term goal to increase dividends over time, as appropriate. On September 11, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.12 per share of common stock to shareholders of record on September 22, 2023 and payable on September 29, 2023. On September 8, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 25.0 million of our common stock in the open market through December 31, 2024. We intend to fund any repurchases from working capital and cash provided by operating activities. As we continue to focus on our goal of maximizing total shareholder return, the Board of Directors along with the management team believe that a share repurchase program is complimentary to the existing dividend policy and is a tax efficient means to further improve shareholder return. Once we completed the repayment of borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility and emerged from our blackout period in December 2022, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan that authorizes a broker to repurchase shares in the open market subject to pre-defined limitations on trading volume and price. The plan included a 30-day cooling off period that did not allow repurchases to commence until January 2023. The plan was effective until June 30, 2023 and had a maximum authorized amount of 5.0 million over that period. During the year ended June 30, 2023, 0.6 million shares of our common stock were repurchased under the plan at a total cost of approximately 3.9 million, including incremental direct transaction costs. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled. We may enter into additional Rule 10b5-1 plans in the future, the terms of which will be approved by the Board of Directors. Capital Expenditures For the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred 6.2 million on development capital expenditures and 0.2 million for plugging and abandoning costs. During the latter half of fiscal year 2023, we participated in the completion and fracture stimulation of a vertical Bakken well. Toward the end of fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024 we have participated in the drilling of two new down dip wells in the Delhi Field. Completion and first production of the wells are expected in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Based on discussions with our operators, we expect capital workover projects to continue in all the fields. Overall, for fiscal year 2024, we expect budgeted capital expenditures to be in the range of 4.0 million to 5.0 million, which excludes any potential acquisitions. Our expected capital expenditures for the next 12 months include the two new drill wells at Delhi Field, discussed above, and also include Foundation, the operator of our Williston Basin properties, drilling two sidetrack locations targeting the Birdbear formation.

 As of June 30, 2023, our PUD reserves included 3.7 MMBOE of reserves and approximately 71.7 million of future development costs primarily associated with the Williston Basin properties. Funding for our anticipated capital expenditures over the near-term is expected to be met from cash flows from operations and current working capital, and as needed from borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Full Cost Pool Ceiling Test Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, depreciation, and amortization and related deferred taxes, are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10 , plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the valuation ceiling ). If capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess would be charged to expense as a write-down of oil and natural gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurred. The quarterly ceiling test calculation requires that we use the average first day of the month price for our petroleum products during the 12-month period ending with the balance sheet date. The prices used in calculating our ceiling test as of June 30, 2023 were 83.23 per barrel of oil, 4.78 per MMBtu of natural gas and 33.71 per barrel of NGLs. As of June 30, 2023, our capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties were below the full cost valuation ceiling. If commodity price levels were to substantially decline from the 12-month average first day of the month pricing levels as of June 30, 2023 and remain down for a prolonged period of time, our valuation ceiling over our capitalized costs may be reduced and adversely impact our ceiling tests in future quarters. We cannot give assurance that a write-down of capitalized oil and natural gas properties will not be required in the future. Additionally, a 10 reduction in respective commodity prices at June 30, 2023, while all other factors remained constant, would not have generated an impairment. Overview of Cash Flow Activities 

Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change Cash flows provided by operating activities 51,272 52,460 (1,188) Cash flows used in investing activities (6,992) (54,873) 47,881 Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities (41,526) 5,416 (46,942) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 2,754 3,003 (249) Cash provided by operating activities decreased 1.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily d ue to decreases in our operating assets and liabilities from the timing of converting working capital into cash. These decreases are partially offset by increases in total revenues over our increase in operating costs. Total revenues increased 19.6 million as compared to the prior year driven by an increase in our average daily production primarily due to our acquisition of non-operated working interests in the Jonah Field and Williston Basin in April 2022 and January 2022, respectively, partially offset by decreases in the average realized price per BOE. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 decreased 47.9 million from the prior year. In fiscal year 2022, we completed the acquisition of our Jonah Field properties totaling 26.4 million and the acquisition of our Williston Basin properties total 25.8 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in development capital expenditures in the current fiscal year. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 were 41.5 million which included the repayment of 21.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, 16.1 million in dividends paid to our common stockholders, and 3.9 million paid to repurchase shares of common stock under our share repurchase program. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 were 5.4 million which primarily included 17.3 million in net borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility offset by 11.8 million in dividends paid to our common stockholders.

 (1) Equivalent oil reserves are defined as six MCF of natural gas and 42 gallons of NGLs to one barrel of oil conversion ratio which reflects energy equivalence and not price equivalence. Natural gas prices per MCF and NGL prices per barrel often differ significantly from the equivalent amount of oil. (2) Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid or received on the settlement of derivative contracts since we did not elect to apply hedge accounting.

 Revenues Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 revenues increased 18.0 to 128.5 million compared to 108.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in revenue is primarily due to our acquisitions of non-operated working interests in the Jonah Field and Williston Basin in the second half of fiscal year 2022. Average daily equivalent production increased 19.3 , from 5,953 BOEPD to 7,104 BOEPD in the current year. Production increases were driven by our acquisitions of non-operated working interests in the Jonah Field and Williston Basin in the second half of fiscal 2022, which increased current fiscal year production by approximately 1,621 BOEPD. The increase in our average daily production from our acquisitions was partially offset by decreases related to downtime at our Barnett Shale properties due to compressor and pipeline repairs as well as shut-in wells and our Delhi Field properties due to winter storms, and Delhi heat exchanger upgrade installation and NGL plant repairs during the fourth fiscal quarter. Our average realized commodity price (excluding the impact of derivative contracts) decreased approximately 0.57 per BOE, or 1.1 , for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022. Realized oil and NGL prices decreased approximately 9.0 and 29.9 respectively, over the prior year. These decreases are partially offset by an increase of approximately 27.5 in realized natural gas prices from the prior year period despite the substantial decrease in natural gas prices that occurred in late third quarter. The year over year increase in realized natural gas prices is primarily attributed to the benefit of natural gas price differentials received at the Jonah Field where our realized price for natural gas for the current year period was 10.63 per MCF. Lease Operating Costs Ad valorem and production taxes were 8.2 million and 7.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ad valorem and production taxes is primarily due to increased production volumes described above as production taxes are based on sales at the wellhead. On a per unit basis, ad valorem and production taxes were 3.15 per BOE and 3.20 per BOE for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ad valorem and production taxes on a per unit basis are due to the increased production volumes described above. The following table summarizes CO 2 costs per Mcf and CO 2 volumes for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. CO 2 purchase costs are for the Delhi Field. Under our contract with the Delhi Field operator, purchased CO 2 is priced at 1 of the realized oil price in the field per Mcf, plus sales taxes and transportation costs as per contract terms. 

Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Variance Variance CO 2 costs per MCF 0.99 1.07 (0.08) (7.5) CO 2 volumes (MMCF per day, gross) 85.2 82.6 2.6 3.1 The 0.3 million decrease in CO 2 costs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 7.5 decrease in CO 2 costs per MCF, which was driven by a decrease in our average realized oil price partially offset by a 3.1 increase in purchased CO 2 volumes. CO 2 purchases provide approximately 20 of the injected volumes in the field and the field s recycle facilities provide the other 80 . We do not have any ownership in the CO 2 pipeline which is owned and operated by Denbury. On a per unit basis, CO 2 costs were 2.84 per BOE and 3.55 per BOE for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other lease operating costs include remedial workover costs and gathering and transportation costs for our oil and natural gas production. Compared to the prior year, other lease operating costs increased 10.0 million, or 29.5 , to 44.0 million in the year ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to the acquisitions in the Jonah Field and Williston Basin in April 2022 and January 2022, respectively, which increased current year other lease operating costs by 8.0 million. Other lease operating costs on a per BOE basis increased to 16.97 per BOE in the current year from 15.64 per BOE in the prior year, an increase of 1.33 per BOE.

 Depletion of Full Cost Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties Depletion expense increased 5.6 million or 74.8 from 7.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 to 13.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in production. On a per unit basis, depletion expense was 5.07 per BOE and 3.46 per BOE for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in depletion per BOE was due primarily to an increase in the depletable base of our unit of production calculation due to our acquisitions in fiscal year 2022 and an increase in our future development costs associated with our proved undeveloped reserve addition in fiscal year 2022 combined with a decrease in our proved reserve volumes. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 increased 1.2 million, or 18.4 , to 7.9 million compared to 6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to approximately 0.6 million for salary and employee benefits due to additional personnel added as additional assets were acquired, and 0.3 million in professional fees associated with our search for a CEO. The remaining increase is associated with fees for accounting and audit-related services and public reporting expenses due to the increased size of our Company. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.03 per BOE to 3.06 per BOE for the year ended June 30, 2023 from 3.09 per BOE for the prior year. The decrease in general and administrative expenses on a per unit basis are due to the increased production volumes described above. Stock-based Compensation Expenses Stock-based compensation increased 1.5 million to 1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 0.1 million the prior period due primarily to the 1.2 million reduction in prior year expense related to the forfeiture of unvested shares in connection with severance, combined with the addition of new personnel, including our CEO and COO, and the associated new awards granted during the current year period to all staff and directors. In addition, approximately 0.1 million of the current year period increase related to a one-time share award granted in November 2022, which vested and was fully expensed immediately. Net Gain (Loss) on Derivative Contracts Periodically, we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We have elected not to designate our open derivative contracts for hedge accounting, and accordingly, we recorded the net change in the mark-to-market valuation of the derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations. The amounts recorded on the consolidated statements of operations related to derivative contracts represent the (i) gains (losses) related to fair value adjustments on our open, or unrealized, derivative contracts, and (ii) gains (losses) on settlements of derivative contracts for positions that have settled or been realized. The table below summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative contracts as well as the impact of net realized (gains) losses on our average realized prices for the periods presented. As a result of our acquisitions during fiscal year 2022 and the corresponding borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we were required by terms in our Senior Secured Credit Facility to hedge a portion of our production. The increase in commodity prices since entering into the hedges resulted in realized losses on derivative contracts for the current and prior years. As of June 30, 2023, we did not have any open crude oil or natural gas derivative contracts.

 Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 0.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 primarily due to the repayment of borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility throughout the year. Income tax (expense) provision For the year ended June 30, 2023, we recognized income tax expense of 10.1 million on net income before income taxes of 45.3 million compared to an income tax expense of 8.5 million on net income before income taxes of 41.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The effective tax rates were 22.2 and 20.7 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the prior year, the Company benefited from certain EOR tax credits whereas in the current year the credits were not available. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These policies, together with our estimates, have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Events and Accounting Policies to our consolidated statements in Item 8. Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments, and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Oil and Natural Gas Properties . Companies engaged in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry. We apply the full cost accounting method for our oil and natural gas properties as prescribed by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful and successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration, and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead, or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties is not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties. We exclude these costs until the property has been evaluated. Costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated. As of June 30, 2023, we had no unevaluated property costs. Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from depletion and amortization, which represent investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geologic and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, and exploration drilling costs. Estimates of Proved Reserves. The estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements. The estimated quantities of proved reserves are used to calculate depletion expense and the estimated future net cash flows associated with those proved reserves is the basis for determining impairment under the quarterly ceiling test calculation. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex and requires significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geologic, geophysical, engineering, and economic data. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information; this includes reservoir performance, additional development activity, new geologic and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes, and other economic factors. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates prepared by our third-party independent engineers represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements. Material revisions to reserve estimates and/or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves. These changes could affect our quarterly ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our depletion rate. Additionally, a 10 decrease in commodity prices used to determine our proved reserves as of

Table of Contents 
 June 30, 2023, while all other factors remained constant, would not have resulted in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties. Holding all other factors constant, a reduction in our proved reserve estimates at June 30, 2023 of 10 would affect depletion, depreciation, and amortization expense by approximately 0.4 million. On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued its final rule on the modernization of reporting oil and natural gas reserves. The rule allows consideration of new technologies in evaluating reserves, generally limits the designation of proved reserves to those projects forecasted to be drilled five years from the initial recognition date of such reserves, allows companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors, requires reporting of oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based on the previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price rather than year-end prices, revises the disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas operations, and revises accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost companies. Stock-based Compensation . The fair value, and for certain awards the expected vesting period, of our performance-based awards were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. This technique uses a geometric Brownian motion model with defined variables and randomly generates values for each variable through multiple trials. Variables include stock price volatility, expected term of the award, the expected risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield of our stock. The risk-free interest rate used is the U.S. Treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the award on the date of grant. Vesting of performance-based awards is based on our total common stock return compared to a peer group of other companies in our industry with comparable market capitalizations and, for certain awards, our share price attaining a set target. Recent Accounting Pronouncements . Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Events and Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity We are exposed to various risks, including energy commodity price risk, such as price differentials between the NYMEX commodity price and the index price at the location where our production is sold. When oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices decline significantly, our ability to finance our capital budget and operations may be adversely impacted. We expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable, therefore we monitor commodity prices to identify the potential need for the use of derivative financial instruments to provide partial protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. We are exposed to market risk on our open derivative contracts related to potential non-performance by our counterparties. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy institutions deemed by management as competitive market makers. For the derivative contracts settled during fiscal 2023 and 2022, we did not post collateral. We account for our derivative activities under the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , ASC 815 ). ASC 815 establishes accounting and reporting that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. See Note 7, Derivatives to our consolidated financial statements for more details. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, any borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either SOFR plus 2.80 , which includes a 0.05 credit spread adjustment from LIBOR, subject to a minimum SOFR of 0.50 , or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus 1.00 . LIBOR rates are sensitive to the period of contract and market volatility, as well as changes in forward interest rate yields. Under our current practices, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evolution Petroleum Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in stockholders equity for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. The Impact of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization DD A and Full Cost Ceiling Test Impairment Calculation Ceiling Test As described in Note 1, the Company follows the full cost method of accounting, pursuant to which oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method over total proved reserves. The Company s proved oil and natural gas properties are evaluated for impairment by the Ceiling Test utilizing the Company s proved oil and natural

 gas reserves in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and SEC guidelines. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded DD A related to its proved oil and natural gas properties of approximately 13.1 million, and there was no ceiling test impairment. The Company engages two independent reservoir engineering firms to serve as a management specialist and to assist with the estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves. To estimate the volume of proved oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows, management and their specialists make significant estimates and assumptions including forecasting the production decline rate of producing properties and forecasting the timing and volume of production associated with the Company s development plan for proved undeveloped properties PUDs ). The estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserves is impacted by management s judgments and estimates regarding the financial performance of wells associated with proved reserves to determine if wells are expected, with reasonable certainty, to be economical under the appropriate pricing assumptions required. Changes in significant assumptions or engineering data could have a significant impact on the amount of DD A and impairment recorded for the Company s proved oil and natural gas properties. We identified the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on DD A and the Ceiling Test as a critical audit matter due to use of significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the significant assumptions used in developing those estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Evaluating the knowledge, skill, and ability of the Company s third-party reservoir engineering specialists and their relationship to the Company, inquiries of those reservoir engineers regarding the process followed and judgments made to estimate the proved reserve volumes, and reading the reserve report prepared by the reservoir engineering specialists. Evaluating significant assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including pricing differentials, future operations costs, future production rates and capital expenditures. The procedures performed included tests of the data inputs used by specialists for completeness and accuracy and an evaluation of the specialist s findings. The procedures performed included: o Testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s estimation of oil and natural gas reserve quantities; o Testing the data inputs used by specialist for completeness and accuracy; o Testing the specialist s findings for mathematical accuracy; and, o Performing analytical procedures on pricing, reserve quantities and cost estimates developed by management and its specialists. Those procedures entailed comparisons of: prices to historical benchmark prices, adjusted for pricing differentials, production forecasts to recent historical actual production, projections of lease operating costs to costs incurred by property during fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and projected production taxes to recent historical taxes incurred and to statutory tax rates. Evaluating the accuracy of revenue and working interest percentages used in the reserve reports by comparing a sample of such interests to the land records. Performing retrospective review of historical estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves to identify potential management bias in estimates. Testing the accuracy of the Company s depletion and impairment calculations that included these proved reserves.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evolution Petroleum Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in stockholders equity for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements and our report dated September 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Any excess over the full cost ceiling limitation is charged to expense as an impairment and is reflected as additional accumulated depletion, depreciation, and impairment or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from depletion and amortization, which represent investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geologic and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests, and exploration drilling costs. These costs are excluded until the project is evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined.

 of the Company s total revenues were realized from the Jonah Field, Barnett Shale and Delhi Field combined. Diversified, the Company s largest operator at Barnett, remitted approximately of total revenue proceeds to the Company and at Delhi Field, Denbury, the operator of the Field, remitted approximately of total revenue proceeds to the Company. At Jonah Field, where the Company takes its natural gas and NGL production in-kind, during the current year, the Company sold approximately of its total revenues to Conoco Phillips. In the year ended June 30, 2022, operators each distributed over 10 of the Company s crude oil, natural gas and NGL revenues making up approximately of total revenues for the year, respectively. The majority of the Company s crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production is sold to purchasers under short-term (less than 12 months) contracts at market-based prices.

 Natural gas Natural gas liquids Total revenues In the Jonah Field, the Company has elected to take its natural gas and NGL working interest production in-kind and markets its NGL production to Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and its natural gas production to different purchasers. The Company does not take production in-kind at any of its other properties and does not negotiate contracts with customers for such production. The Company recognizes crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production revenue at the point in time when custody and title control of the product transfers to the customer. The sales of oil and natural gas are made under contracts which the Company s third-party operators of its wells have negotiated with customers, which typically include variable consideration that is based on pricing tied to local indices and volumes delivered in the current month. The Company receives payment from the sale of oil and natural gas production one to after delivery. Judgments made in applying the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , relate primarily to determining the point in time when control of product transfers to the customer. The Company does not believe that significant judgments are required with respect to the determination of the transaction price, including amounts that represent variable consideration, as volume and price carry a low level of estimation uncertainty given the precision of volumetric measurements and the use of index pricing with predictable differentials. Accordingly, the Company does not consider estimates of variable consideration to be constrained. The Company s contractual performance obligations arise upon the production of hydrocarbons from wells in which the Company has an ownership interest. The performance obligations are considered satisfied upon control of produced hydrocarbons transferring to a customer at a specified delivery point. Consideration is allocated to completed performance obligations at the end of an accounting period. Revenue is recorded in the month when contractual performance obligations are satisfied. However, settlement statements from the purchasers of hydrocarbons and the related cash consideration are received by field operators one to before the Company receives payment and documentation from the operator, which is typical in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result, the Company must estimate the amount of production delivered to the customer and the consideration that will ultimately be received for the sale of the product. To estimate accounts receivable from operators contracts with customers, the Company uses knowledge of its properties, information from field operators, historical performance, contractual arrangements, index pricing, quality and transportation differentials, and other factors.

 million. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and allocated all of the purchase price (including million of transaction costs) to proved oil and natural gas properties. Approximately, million of the consideration transferred related to deposits transferred to the Company at closing, the largest related to a million deposit with Enterprise for a gas gathering contract which was recorded to Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company recognized million in non-cash asset retirement obligations. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and million in borrowings under the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility. On January 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of non-operated working interests in the Williston Basin in North Dakota from Foundation Energy Fund VII-A, LP and Foundation Energy Management, LLC (the Williston Basin Acquisition ). After taking into account customary closing adjustments and an effective date of June 1, 2021, cash consideration was million which included million of capitalized transaction costs related to the acquisition. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and allocated all of the purchase price (including capitalized transaction costs) to proved oil and natural gas properties. The Company also recognized million in non-cash asset retirement obligations. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and million in borrowings under the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility. In accordance with the FASB s authoritative guidance on asset acquisitions, the Company allocated the cost of the above acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a relative fair value basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with recognition of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recorded. Incremental legal and professional fees related directly to the acquisitions were capitalized as part of the acquisition cost. The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Fair value measurements also utilize market assumptions of market participants. Less: Accumulated depletion, depreciation, and impairment ) ) Oil and natural gas properties, net As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, all oil and natural gas property costs were subject to amortization. Depletion on oil and natural gas properties was million and million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation on other properties and equipment was less than million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company s other properties and equipment were fully depreciated as of June 30, 2022.

 million and million, respectively. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a downward million purchase adjustment related to its acquisition of the Barnett Shale properties. The Company received million during the year ended June 30, 2022 primarily related to effective date net revenues received from the previous owner of the properties. The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties. All costs of acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas and properties when incurred. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of deferred taxes, such excess capitalized costs would be charged to expense as a write-down of oil and natural gas properties. At June 30, 2023, the ceiling test value of the Company s reserves was calculated based on the first-day-of-the-month average for the 12-months ended June 30, 2023 of the West Texas Intermediate WTI crude oil spot price of per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of per MMBtu, adjusted by market differentials by field. The net price per barrel of NGLs was , which was based on historical differentials to WTI as NGLs do not have any single comparable reference index price. Using these prices at June 30, 2023, the cost center ceiling was higher than the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, and as a result, write-down was necessary. At June 30, 2022, the ceiling test value of the Company s reserves was calculated based on the first-day-of-the-month average for the 12-months ended June 30, 2022 of the WTI crude oil spot price of per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of per MMBtu, adjusted by market differentials by field. The net price per barrel of NGLs was , which was based on historical differentials to WTI as NGLs do not have any single comparable reference index price. Using these prices at June 30, 2022, the cost center ceiling was higher than the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, and as a result, write-down was necessary. , senior secured reserve-based credit facility, as amended, (the Senior Secured Credit Facility with MidFirst Bank in an amount up to million with a current borrowing base of million. On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility extending the maturity to . The Tenth Amendment also replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of to effectively convert SOFR to a LIBOR equivalent and modifies the Margined Collateral Value, as defined in the Ninth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, to million. The borrowing base will be redetermined semiannually, with the lenders and the Company each having the right to interim unscheduled redetermination between any two consecutive semi-annual redeterminations. The borrowing base takes into account the estimated value of the Company s oil and natural gas properties, proved reserves, total indebtedness, and other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. The Senior Secured Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the borrowing base. Any borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company s option, at either SOFR plus , which includes a credit spread adjustment from LIBOR, subject to a minimum SOFR of , or the Prime Rate, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, plus .

As of June 30, 2023, the Company did t have any borrowings outstanding under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, resulting in million of available borrowing capacity. . On February 7, 2022, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. This amendment, among other things, modified the definition of utilization percentage related to the required hedging covenant such that for the purposes of determining the amount of future production to hedge, the utilization of the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be based on the Margined Collateral Value, as defined in the agreement, to the extent it exceeds the borrowing base then in effect. This amendment also required the Company to enter into hedges for the next 12-month period ending February 2023, covering of expected crude oil and natural gas production over that period.

This amendment, among other things, increased the borrowing base to million and added a hedging covenant whereby the Company must hedge a minimum of to of future production on a rolling 12-month basis when or more of the borrowing base is utilized. The hedging covenant was amended in the Ninth Amendment, as discussed above. On August 5, 2021 the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility which, among other things, added definitions for the terms Acquired Entity or Mineral Interests and Acquired Entity or Mineral Interests EBITDA Adjustment. Additionally, the consolidated tangible net worth covenant level was reduced to million from million. unrecognized tax benefits, r any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

In the prior year, the Company released its valuation allowance of million. The Company considered all positive and negative evidence to assess the likelihood that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income over the period the deferred tax assets are deductible. For the three-year period ending June 30, 2022, the Company was in a cumulative income position. Based on the weight of available evidence, the Company believed that is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred income taxes primarily represent the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The Company records the net change in fair value of these positions in Net gain (loss) on derivative contracts in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company is able to value the assets and liabilities based on observable market data for similar instruments, which resulted in the Company reporting its derivatives as Level 2. This observable data includes the forward curves for commodity prices based on quoted market prices and implied volatility factors related to changes in the forward curves. See Note 7, Derivatives , for additional discussion of derivatives. Historically, the Company s derivative contracts were with large utilities with investment grade credit ratings which are believed to have minimal credit risk. As such, the Company was exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparties in the derivative contracts. To date, the Company has not experienced such nonperformance.

 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company began paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock in December 2013. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has cumulatively paid over million in cash dividends. The Company paid dividends of million and million to its common stockholders during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table reflects the dividends paid per share within the respective quarterly periods: Third quarter ended March 31, Second quarter ended December 31, First quarter ended September 30, On , Evolution s Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable . Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, for a further discussion. On September 8, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock in the open market through . The Company intends to fund repurchases from working capital and cash provided by operating activities. The Board of Directors along with the management team believe that a share repurchase program is complimentary to the existing dividend policy and is a tax efficient means to further improve shareholder return. The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will depend on a variety of factors, including management s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company s shares, the market price of the Company s common stock, the Company s capital needs and resources, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal requirements. The value of shares authorized for repurchase by the Company s Board of Directors does not require the Company to repurchase such shares or guarantee that such shares will be repurchased, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Once the Company completed repayment of borrowings on its Senior Secured Credit Facility and emerged from its blackout period in December 2022, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 plan that authorized a broker to repurchase shares in the open market subject to pre-defined limitations on trading volume and price. The plan included a 30-day cooling off period that did not allow repurchases to commence until January 2023. The plan was effective until June 30, 2023 and had a maximum authorized amount of million over that period. During the year ended , million shares of the Company s common stock were repurchased under the plan at a total cost of approximately million, including incremental direct transaction costs. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company also acquired treasury stock upon the vesting of employee stock-based awards to fund payroll tax withholding obligations. These treasury shares were subsequently cancelled.

Expected Tax Treatment of Dividends For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, all common stock dividends for that fiscal year were treated for tax purposes as qualified dividend income to the recipients. Based on its current projections for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company expects all common stock dividends for such period to be treated as qualified dividend income to the recipients. Stock-Based Incentive Plan The Evolution Petroleum Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended the 2016 Plan ), authorizes the issuance of million shares of common stock prior to its expiration on December 8, 2026. Incentives under the 2016 Plan may be granted to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company in any one or a combination of the following forms: incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of incentives valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, the Company s common stock, including its appreciation in value. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately million shares and million shares, respectively, remained available for grant under the 2016 Plan. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based compensation awards on the grant date to provide the basis for future compensation expense. For the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, related to stock-based compensation expense recorded as a component of General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized a reduction of million to stock-based compensation expense for the forfeiture of unvested shares in connection with severance. Time-Vested Restricted Stock Awards Time-vested restricted stock awards contain service-based vesting conditions and expire after a maximum of four years from the date of grant if unvested. The common shares underlying these awards are issued on the date of grant and participate in dividends paid by the Company. These service-based awards vest with continuous employment by the Company, generally in annual installments over terms of three to four years . Awards to the Company s directors generally have cliff vesting. For such awards, grant date fair value is based on market value of the Company s common stock at the time of grant. This value is then amortized ratably over the service period. Previously recognized amortization expense subsequent to the last vesting date of an award is reversed in the event that the holder has no longer rendered service to the Company resulting in forfeiture of the award.

Property acquisition costs are those costs incurred to lease property, including both undeveloped leasehold, and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that may warrant examination, examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves, costs of drilling exploratory wells, geologic and geophysical assessment costs, and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling. Development costs also include amounts incurred due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations of 2.0 million, 7.8 million, and 2.9 million during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

NSAI and DeGolyer MacNaughton D M ). Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. SEC methodology requires the application of the previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price, and current costs held constant throughout the projected reserve life, when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce. Our policies regarding internal controls over reserves estimates require such estimates to be prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm under the supervision of our internal reserve engineering team, which includes our Chief Operating Officer (COO). Our internal reserve engineering team and third-party consultants have a combined experience of over 80 years in Petroleum Engineering. Our COO, the person responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A M University, is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 86704), has over 40 years of oil and natural gas experience including large independents and financial firm services for projects and acquisitions. Our Board of Directors also has oversight of our reserve estimation process and contains a Reserves Committee with an independent director who is a Register Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 47279) with experience in energy company reserve

 evaluations. Such reserve estimates comply with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles, definitions, and guidelines as established by the SEC. The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report at NSAI is Matthew D. Pankey, P.E., Petroleum Engineer. Mr. Pankey, a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 142931), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2019 and has over six years of prior industry experience. The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report at D M is Dr. Dilhan Ilk, P.E, Executive Vice President. Dr. Ilk received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering in 2003 from Istanbul Technical University and a Master s degree and Doctorate in Petroleum Engineering in 2005 and 2010, respectively, from Texas A M University, and he has in excess of 13 years of experience in oil and natural gas reservoir studies and evaluations and is a licensed Professional Engineer in the state of Texas (No. 139334). Proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimated quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. There are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, projecting future production rates, and timing of development expenditures. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimated quantities of proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and changes in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves for each of the periods indicated are as follows:

The company produced 2.6 MBOE during the year ended June 30, 2023. Improved recovery, extensions and discoveries . During the fiscal year 2023, the Company added 0.1 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily associated with the addition of two new PUD wells at Delhi Field. Revisions of previous estimates. Net Revisions in fiscal year 2023 totaled 2.6 MMBOE primarily associated the Delhi Field and Barnett Shale. Reserve projections were revised downward at Delhi Field due to actual fiscal 2023 production coming in lower than fiscal year end 2022 projection. Additionally, Barnett Shale reserves decreased due primarily to increased production costs in the field shortening the economic life of many wells. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, notable changes in total proved reserves included the following: Purchase of reserves in place . During the fiscal year ended 2022, the Company completed the Williston Basin Acquisition and the Jonah Field Acquisition. See Note 4, Acquisitions for more details. Improved recovery, extensions and discoveries . During the fiscal year 2022, the Company added 3.6 MBOE of PUD reserves associated with drilling locations at its Willison Basin properties. Revisions of previous estimates. Net Revisions in fiscal year 2022 totaled 2.2 MMBOE, which included a net positive revision in the Company s proved developed reserves of 4.0 MMBOE offset by the removal of 1.8 MMBOE of PUD reserves at the Delhi Field, related to Test Site V. At this time, the operator at Delhi does not currently have Test Site V on its expenditure schedule for the next five years and, as a result, has been excluded from the Company s PUD reserves. The net positive revision in the Company s proved developed reserves of 4.0 MMBOE includes positive revisions totaling 4.7 MMBOE primarily related to the improvement in the SEC trailing 12-month pricing offset by a 0.7 MMBOE downward adjustment at Delhi due to lower than anticipated production during fiscal year 2022. 
 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, notable changes in total proved reserves included the following: 
 Purchase of reserves in place . During the fiscal year ended 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of its Barnett Shale properties totaling 17.4 million. Revisions of previous estimates . Revisions in fiscal year 2021 were primarily due to positive revisions at Hamilton Dome Field reflecting the impact of increased oil pricing in the field on future production and extension of reserves economic limit. Positive NGL revisions at Delhi Field reflect the impact of increased pricing on future production and the extension of reserves economic limit. Positive natural gas revisions in the Barnett Shale properties reflect the impact of increased natural gas prices from the date the Barnett Shale acquisition was completed on May 7, 2021 to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2021.

 requires that net cash flow amounts be discounted at 10 . Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing proved oil and natural gas reserves and for asset retirement obligations, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate period-end statutory tax rates to the future pretax net cash flow related to proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of the related properties. The future income tax expenses do not give effect to tax credits, allowances, or the impact of general and administrative costs of ongoing operations relating to the Company s proved oil and natural gas reserves. Changes in the demand for oil and natural gas, inflation, and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms; this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Generally accepted accounting principles include those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. The effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, has been audited by Moss Adams LLP., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended June 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information On September 7, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws for the Company, which were originally adopted effective January 2, 2004. The principal changes to the Bylaws are: (i) adding a new Section 2.10 specifying the procedures to be followed for shareholders in proposing nominees for director and other items of business at annual and special meetings of stockholders; (ii) expanding the ability of the Company to implement procedures that allow shareholders to participate in meetings remotely; (iii) providing for mandatory indemnification of officers and directors for certain actions to the extent permitted by Nevada law; and (iv) allowing shareholders to take action by written consent to the extent that such consent is signed by the holders of no less than two-thirds (2/3rds) of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon. A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.3 and is incorporated in this Item 9B by reference. Also on September 7, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted an Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy intended to meet the requirements of newly adopted Section 811 of the NYSE American Company Guide and new Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is adopting the policy in advance of the deadline mandated by Section 811. As required by Section 811, the Company s policy provides for the recovery of incentive compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement. A copy of the Company s Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy is attached hereto as Exhibit 97 and is incorporated in this Item 9B by reference. Item 9C.

BYLAWS OF EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION (Amended and Restated as of September 7, 2023) 
 ARTICLE I OFFICES
 Section 1.1 Principal Office The principal executive office of the Corporation shall be such location as deemed necessary from time to time by the Board of Directors.

 Section 2.1 Annual Meeting An annual meeting of the shareholders, for the selection of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation no later than the fifteenth day of the sixth month following the end of the fiscal year of the Corporation or, if such date shall fall on a holiday, the next business day thereafter. The Board of Directors may change the date or elect to have no annual meeting for a particular year. If the election of directors is not held on the day designated for any annual meeting of the shareholders or at any adjournment of the meeting, the Board of Directors shall call for the election to be held at a special meeting of the Shareholders as soon thereafter as possible.
 Section 2.2 Special Meetings 
 Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called by the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, or the holders of not less than one-tenth of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as they or he shall fix. Section 2.3 Notice of Meetings Written notice of the place, date and time of all meetings of the shareholders shall be given, not 

 3 

less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law (meaning, here and hereinafter, as required from time to time by the Corporation statutes of the State of Nevada, as contained in Chapter 78 of Nevada Revised Statutes, or the Articles of Incorporation).
 When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. Section 2.4 Quorum At any meeting of the shareholders, the holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes, unless or except to the extent that the presence of a larger number may be required by law.
 If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of the stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another reasonable place, date and time of day. If a notice of any adjourned special meeting of shareholders is sent to all shareholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that it will be held with those present constituting a quorum, then except as otherwise required by law, those present at such adjourned meeting shall constitute a quorum, and all matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting. Section 2.5 Organization Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the highest ranking officer of the Corporation who is present shall call to order any meeting of the shareholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be the person the chairman appoints.
 Section 2.6 Conduct of Business The chairman of any meeting of shareholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
 Section 2.7 Proxies and Voting At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by 

 4 

proxy authorized by an instrument in writing filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting.
 Each shareholder shall have one vote for every share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in his name on the record date for the meeting, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefor by a shareholder entitled to vote or his proxy, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the shareholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting. Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by an inspector or inspectors appointed by the chairman of the meeting. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders, unless the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws. Section 2.8 Shareholder Action By Written Consent Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Shareholders may be taken by written consent without a meeting if such action is taken in conformance with the Nevada Corporations Code and is signed by the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.
 Section 2.9 Stock List A complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each such shareholder and the number of shares registered in his name, shall be open to the examination of any such shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.
 The Stock list shall also be kept at the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and shall be open to the examination of any such shareholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. Section 2.10 Nominations and Business at Stockholder Meetings. (A) Annual Meetings of Stockholders. (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual

 7 

principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

 ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHERS
 Section 6.1 Generally 
 (A) Indemnity for Claim Not in Name of Corporation. (1) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney s fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. (2) The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or items equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and 
 15 

with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. (B) Indemnity for Claims in Name of Corporation (1) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorney s fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. The Corporation may not indemnify any such person if it is proven that such person s act, or failure to act, constituted a breach of such person s fiduciary duties as a director or office, and such breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law, making such person liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. (2) Indemnification may not be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. Section 6.2 Expenses To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 6.1 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney s fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in Section 6.3 of this Article upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Section 6.3 Determination by Board of Directors Any indemnification under Section 6.1 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because 

 16 

he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 of this Article. Such determination shall be made by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum of the directors, or by the shareholders.
 Section 6.4 Non-exclusive Right The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or interested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 Section 6.5 Insurance The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article. The Corporation s indemnity of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall be reduced by any amounts such person may collect as indemnification (i) under any policy of insurance purchased and maintained on his behalf by the Corporation or (ii) from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. Section 6.6 Violation of Law
 Nothing contained in this Article, or elsewhere in these By-laws, shall operate to indemnify any director or officer if such indemnification is for any reason contrary to law, either as a matter of public policy, or under the provisions of the Federal Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any other applicable state or federal law. Section 6.7 Coverage For the purposes of this Article, references to the Corporation include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such a constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would if he had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity.

 17 

Section 6.8 Effect of Amendment 
 No amendment, modification or repeal of this Article or any provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise to be indemnified by the Corporation, nor the obligation of the Corporation to indemnify any such person under and in accordance with the provisions of this Article 6 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising, in whole or in part, from a state of facts existing on the date of, or relating to matters occurring prior to, such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

 EXHIBIT 99.1 
 August 10, 2023 Mr. Kelly W. Loyd Evolution Petroleum Corporation 1155 Dairy Ashford Street, Suite 425 Houston, Texas 77079 Dear Mr. Loyd: In accordance with your request, we have estimated the proved reserves and future revenue, as of June 30, 2023, to the Evolution Petroleum Corporation (Evolution) interest in certain oil and gas properties located in North Dakota and Wyoming, referred to herein as the Jonah and Williston Assets. We completed our evaluation on or about the date of this letter. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimated in this report constitute approximately 39 percent of all proved reserves owned by Evolution. The estimates in this report have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. Definitions are presented immediately following this letter. This report has been prepared for Evolution s use in filing with the SEC; in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. We estimate the net reserves and future net revenue to the Evolution interest in the Jonah and Williston Assets, as of June 30, 2023, to be: Net Reserves Future Net Revenue (M Oil NGL Gas Present Worth Category (MBBL) (MBBL) (MMCF) Total at 10 Proved Developed Producing 1,853.7 709.0 35,937.7 227,709.2 137,105.1 Proved Developed Non-Producing 122.2 8.5 29.9 3,479.5 1,057.2 Proved Undeveloped 2,588.8 585.4 2,430.6 84,107.9 26,979.3 Total Proved 4,564.8 1,302.9 38,398.1 315,296.6 165,141.7 
 Totals may not add because of rounding. The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBBL); a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. Gas volumes are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty; reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. As requested, probable and possible reserves that exist for these properties have not been included. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. This report does not include any value that could be attributed to interests in undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. Gross revenue is Evolution s share of the gross (100 percent) revenue from the properties prior to any deductions. Future net revenue is after deductions for Evolution s share of production taxes, ad valorem taxes, capital costs, abandonment costs, and operating expenses but before consideration of any income taxes. The future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent to determine its present worth, which is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of money. Future net revenue presented in this report, whether discounted or undiscounted, should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties. 

Prices used in this report are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period July 2022 through June 2023. For oil and NGL volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate spot price of 83.23 per barrel is adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of 4.78 per MMBTU is adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 81.76 per barrel of oil, 30.77 per barrel of NGL, and 7.51 per MCF of gas. Operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of Evolution. These costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the district and field levels. Operating costs have been divided into per-well costs and per-unit-of-production costs. Since all properties are nonoperated, headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses are not included. Operating costs are not escalated for inflation. Capital costs used in this report were provided by Evolution and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment. Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review of the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs used in this report are Evolution s estimates of the costs to abandon the wells and production facilities, net of any salvage value. Capital costs and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation. For the purposes of this report, we did not perform any field inspection of the properties, nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and facilities. We have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties; therefore, our estimates do not include any costs due to such possible liability. We have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the Evolution interest. Therefore, our estimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances; our projections are based on Evolution receiving its net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production. Additionally, we have made no specific investigation of any firm transportation contracts that may be in place for these properties; our estimates of future revenue include the effects of such contracts only to the extent that the associated fees are accounted for in the historical field- and lease-level accounting statements. The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible; probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, our estimates are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Evolution, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that our projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing this report. For the purposes of this report, we used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using deterministic methods; these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a 

combination of methods, including performance analysis and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. The data used in our estimates were obtained from Evolution, public data sources, and the nonconfidential files of Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. (NSAI) and were accepted as accurate. Supporting work data are on file in our office. We have not examined the titles to the properties or independently confirmed the actual degree or type of interest owned. The technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented herein meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. Matthew D. Pankey, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2019 and has over 6 years of prior industry experience. We are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; we do not own an interest in these properties nor are we employed on a contingent basis.

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 
 The following definitions are set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a). Also included is supplemental information from (1) the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, (2) the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, and (3) the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. (1) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. (2) Analogous reservoir . Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: (i) Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest); (ii) Same environment of deposition; (iii) Similar geological structure; and (iv) Same drive mechanism. Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) : Reservoir properties must, in the aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest. (3) Bitumen . Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. (4) Condensate . Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. (5) Deterministic estimate . The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. (6) Developed oil and gas reserves . Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Supplemental definitions from the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System: Developed Producing Reserves Expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved recovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. Developed Non-Producing Reserves Shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. (7) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to: (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves. (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems.

 (iv) Provide improved recovery systems. (8) Development project . A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. (9) Development well . A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. (10) Economically producible . The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. (11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) . Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date. (12) Exploration costs . Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are: (i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or G G costs. (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records. (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions. (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells. (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. (13) Exploratory well . An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. (14) Extension well . An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. (15) Field . An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. (16) Oil and gas producing activities . (i) Oil and gas producing activities include: (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations; (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties; (C) The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as: (1) Lifting the oil and gas to the surface; and (2) Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons); and (D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction. Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i) : The oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a terminal point , which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. If unusual physical or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as: 
 Definitions - Page 2 of 6 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 
 a. The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal; and b. In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading, the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas. Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i): For purposes of this paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered. (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include: (A) Transporting, refining, or marketing oil and gas; (B) Processing of produced oil, gas, or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production; (C) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil, gas, or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted; or (D) Production of geothermal steam. (17) Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. (i) When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. (iv) The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects. (v) Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations. (18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. (i) When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. (iv) See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section.

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 
 (19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. (20) Production costs . (i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are: (A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. (B) Repairs and maintenance. (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. (E) Severance taxes. (ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. (21) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. (22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

 (24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. (25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. (26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Note to paragraph (a)(26) : Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). Excerpted from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas: 932-235-50-30 A standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to an entity s interests in both of the following shall be disclosed as of the end of the year: a. Proved oil and gas reserves (see paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B) b. Oil and gas subject to purchase under long-term supply, purchase, or similar agreements and contracts in which the entity participates in the operation of the properties on which the oil or gas is located or otherwise serves as the producer of those reserves (see paragraph 932-235-50-7). The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to those two types of interests in reserves may be combined for reporting purposes. 932-235-50-31 All of the following information shall be disclosed in the aggregate and for each geographic area for which reserve quantities are disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B: a. Future cash inflows. These shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entity s proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end. b. Future development and production costs. These costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. If estimated development expenditures are significant, they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs. c. Future income tax expenses. These expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entity s proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax expenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entity s proved oil and gas reserves. d. Future net cash flows. These amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows. e. Discount. This amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. f. Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount. (27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. (28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. (29) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion.

 (30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area. (31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. From the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (October 26, 2009): Although several types of projects such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas, remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods, this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances. No particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period, and any extension beyond five years should be the exception, and not the rule. Factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include, but are not limited to, the following: The company s level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed (for example, drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities); The company s historical record at completing development of comparable long-term projects; The amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases, or booked the reserves, without significant development activities; The extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan (for example, if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans, recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate); and The extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment (for example, restrictions on development on Federal lands, but not obtaining government permits), rather than by internal factors (for example, shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority). (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. (32) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.

 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 5001 Spring Valley Road Suite 800 E as t Dallas, Texas 75244 EXHIBIT 99.2 
 August 7, 2023 Evolution Petroleum Corporation 1155 Dairy Ashford Rd., Suite 425 Houston, Texas 77079 Ladies and Gentlemen: Pursuant to your request, this report of third party presents an independent evaluation, as of June 30, 2023, of the extent and value of the estimated net proved oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and gas reserves of the Delhi field in Louisiana, the net proved developed producing condensate, NGL, and gas reserves of the Barnett Shale in Texas, and the net proved developed producing oil reserves of the Hamilton Dome field in Wyoming in which Evolution Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as Evolution) have represented they hold an interest. The properties evaluated herein consist of working and royalty interests. This evaluation was completed on August 7, 2023. Evolution has represented that these properties account for 60.65 percent on a net equivalent barrel basis of Evolution s net proved reserves as of June 30, 2023. The net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This report was prepared in accordance with the guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of Regulation S K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by Evolution. Reserves estimates included herein are expressed as net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum remaining to be produced from these properties after June 30, 2023. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests held by Evolution after deducting all interests held by others. Values for proved reserves in this report are expressed in terms of future gross revenue, future net revenue, and present worth. Future gross revenue is defined as that revenue which will accrue to the evaluated interests from the production and sale 

2 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 of the estimated net reserves. Future net revenue is calculated by deducting production taxes, ad valorem taxes, operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment costs from future gross revenue. Operating expenses include field operating expenses, carbon dioxide purchase expenses, transportation and processing expenses, compression charges, and overhead that directly relates to production activities. Capital costs include drilling and completion costs, facilities costs, and field maintenance costs. Abandonment costs are represented by Evolution to be inclusive of those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with abandonment. At the request of Evolution, future income taxes were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. Present worth is defined as future net revenue discounted at a discount rate of 10 percent per year compounded at mid-year on an annual basis over the expected period of realization. Present worth should not be construed as fair market value because no consideration was given to additional factors that influence the prices at which properties are bought and sold. Estimates of reserves and revenue should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information. Information used in the preparation of this report was obtained from Evolution and from public sources. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished by Evolution with respect to the property interests being evaluated, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. Definition of Reserves Petroleum reserves included in this report are classified by degree of proof as proved. Only proved reserves have been evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using 

3 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 prices and costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows: Proved oil and gas reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: 

4 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Developed oil and gas reserves Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered: (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 

5 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4 10 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. Methodology and Procedures Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in accordance with the reserves definition of Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X of the SEC and with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (revised June 2019) Approved by the SPE Board on 25 June 2019 and in Monograph 3 and Monograph 4 published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers. The method or combination of methods used in the analysis was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history. Based on the current stage of field development, production performance, the development plans provided by Evolution, and analysis of areas offsetting existing wells with test or production data, reserves were classified as proved. The proved undeveloped reserves estimates were based on opportunities identified in the plan of development provided by Evolution. Evolution has represented that its senior management is committed to the development plan provided by Evolution and that Evolution has the financial capability to execute the development plan, including the drilling and completion of wells and the installation of equipment and facilities. When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP). Structure maps were prepared to delineate each reservoir, and isopach maps were 

6 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation. Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. Certain properties evaluated herein are produced using enhanced oil recovery methods involving continuous carbon dioxide flooding operations. Therefore, carbon dioxide versus oil ratios and carbon dioxide injection volumes were analyzed and projected and were used in the estimation of reserves when applicable. For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production as defined under the Definition of Reserves heading of this report. For the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs, a performance-based methodology integrating the appropriate geology and petroleum engineering data was utilized for this report. Performance-based methodology primarily includes (1) production diagnostics, (2) decline-curve analysis, and (3) model-based analysis (if necessary, based on availability of data). Production diagnostics include data quality control, identification of flow regimes, and characteristic well performance behavior. Characteristic rate-decline profiles from diagnostic interpretation were translated to modified hyperbolic rate profiles, including one or multiple b-exponent values followed by an exponential decline. Based on the availability of data, model-based analysis may be integrated to evaluate long-term decline behavior, the effect of dynamic reservoir and fracture parameters on well performance, and complex situations sourced by the nature of unconventional reservoirs. In certain cases, reserves were estimated by incorporating elements of analogy with similar wells or reservoirs for which more complete data were available. Data provided by Evolution from wells drilled through June 30, 2023, and made available for this evaluation were used to prepare the reserves estimates herein. These reserves estimates were based on consideration of monthly production data available for certain properties only through March 31, 2023. Estimated cumulative production, as of June 

7 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 30, 2023, was deducted from the estimated gross ultimate recovery to estimate gross reserves. This required that production be estimated for up to 3 months. Oil and condensate reserves estimated herein are to be recovered by normal field separation. NGL reserves estimated herein include pentanes and heavier fractions (C 5+ and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which consists primarily of propane and butane fractions and are the result of low-temperature plant processing. Oil, condensate, and NGL reserves included in this report are expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl). In these estimates, 1 barrel equals 42 United States gallons. For reporting purposes, oil and condensate reserves have been estimated separately and are presented herein as a summed quantity. Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as the total gas to be produced from the reservoirs, measured at the point of delivery, after reduction for fuel usage, flare, and shrinkage resulting from field separation and processing. Gas reserves estimated herein are reported as sales gas. Gas quantities are expressed at a temperature base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit F) and at the pressure base of the state in which the quantities are located. Gas quantities included in this report are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMcf). Gas quantities are identified by the type of reservoir from which the gas will be produced. Nonassociated gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions with no oil present in the reservoir. Associated gas is both gas-cap gas and solution gas. Gas-cap gas is gas at initial reservoir conditions and is in communication with an underlying oil zone. Solution gas is gas dissolved in oil at initial reservoir conditions. Gas quantities estimated herein include both associated and nonassociated gas. Primary Economic Assumptions Revenue values in this report were estimated using initial prices, expenses, and costs provided by Evolution. Future prices were estimated using guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The following economic assumptions were used for estimating the revenue values reported herein: Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices Evolution has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, 

8 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. The oil, condensate, and NGL prices were calculated using differentials furnished by Evolution to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reference price of 83.23 per barrel and held constant thereafter. The volume-weighted average prices attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the properties were 76.44 per barrel of oil and condensate and 34.55 per barrel of NGL. Gas Prices Evolution has represented that the gas prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements. Evolution supplied differentials to the Henry Hub gas reference price of 4.78 per million Btu. The prices were held constant thereafter. Btu factors were provided by Evolution and used to convert prices from dollars per million Btu to dollars per thousand cubic feet. The volume-weighted average price attributable to the estimated proved reserves over the lives of the properties was 4.731 per thousand cubic feet of gas. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes Production taxes were calculated using rates provided by Evolution, including, where appropriate, abatements for enhanced recovery programs. Ad valorem taxes were calculated using rates provided by Evolution based on recent payments. Evolution has represented that the Delhi carbon dioxide flood has been qualified as a tertiary recovery project and that no oil production taxes will be charged until certain investment and interest expenses have been paid out from the project revenue. Oil production taxes then revert to a 12.5-percent rate, which rate is held constant until average oil production per well drops below 25 barrels per day, and then reduced to 6.25 percent thereafter. Payout is not expected to occur prior to depletion, so no oil production taxes are included herein for the Delhi field. 

9 DeGolyer and MacNaughton 
 Operating Expenses, Capital Costs, and Abandonment Costs Estimates of operating expenses, provided by Evolution and based on current expenses, were held constant for the lives of the properties. Future capital expenditures were estimated using values from the 12 months prior to the as-of date of this report, provided by Evolution, and were not adjusted for inflation. In certain cases, future expenditures, either higher or lower than current expenditures, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions, but no general escalation that might result from inflation was applied. Abandonment costs, which are those costs associated with the removal of equipment, plugging of wells, and reclamation and restoration associated with the abandonment, were provided by Evolution and were not adjusted for inflation. Operating expenses, capital costs, and abandonment costs were considered, as appropriate, in determining the economic viability of the undeveloped reserves estimated herein. In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves, estimated future net revenue from proved reserves, and present worth of estimated future net revenue from proved reserves of oil, condensate, NGL, and gas contained in this report has been prepared in accordance with Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6, 932-235-50-7, 932-235-50-9, 932-235-50-30, and 932-235-50-31(a), (b), and (e) of the Accounting Standards Update 932-235-50, Extractive Industries Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the FASB and Rules 4 10(a) (1) (32) of Regulation S X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S K of the SEC; provided, however, that (i) future income tax expenses have not been taken into account in estimating the future net revenue and present worth values set forth herein and (ii) estimates of the proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year. To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.

 5. Disclosures The Company shall make all disclosures and filings with respect to this Policy and maintain all documents and records that are required by the applicable rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC (including, without limitation, Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) and any applicable exchange listing standard. 6. Definitions In addition to terms otherwise defined in this Policy, the following terms, when used in this Policy, shall have the following meanings: Applicable Period means the three completed fiscal years preceding the earlier of: (i) the date that the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. Covered Person means any person who receives Recoverable Compensation. Executive Officer includes the Company s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), president, any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person (including any executive officer of the Company s affiliates) who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Financial Reporting Measure means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements (including non-GAAP financial measures, such as those appearing in earnings releases), and any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Examples of Financial Reporting Measures include measures based on: revenues, net income, operating income, financial ratios, EBITDA, liquidity measures, return measures (such as return on assets), profitability of one or more segments, sales per square foot, same store sales, revenue per user, and cost per employee. Stock price and total shareholder return TSR also are Financial Reporting Measures. I mpracticable means, after exercising a normal due process review of all the relevant facts and circumstances and taking all steps required by Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 and any applicable exchange listing standard, the Compensation Committee determines that recovery of the Incentive-Based Compensation is impracticable because: (i) it has determined that the direct expense that the Company would pay to a third party to assist in recovering the Incentive-Based Compensation would exceed the amount to be recovered; (ii) it has concluded that the recovery of the Incentive-

 Based Compensation would violate home country law adopted prior to November 28, 2022; or (iii) it has determined that the recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation would cause a tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to the Company s employees, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. Incentive-Based Compensation includes any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure; however it does not include: (i) base salaries; (ii) discretionary cash bonuses; (iii) awards (either cash or equity) that are based upon subjective, strategic or operational standards; and (iv) equity awards that vest solely on the passage of time. Received Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed Received in any Company fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. Recoverable Compensation means all Incentive-Based Compensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis) Received after [ DATE OF ADOPTION OF POLICY ] by a person: (i) after beginning service as an Executive Officer; (ii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation; (iii) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national securities association; and (iv) during the Applicable Period, that exceeded the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had the amount been determined based on the Financial Performing Measures, as reflected in the Restatement. With respect to Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR, when the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement, the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received. Restatement means an accounting restatement of any of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (often referred to as a Big R restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (often referred to as a little r restatement). A Restatement does not include situations in which financial statement changes did not result from material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, such as, but not limited to retrospective: (i) application of a change in accounting principles; (ii) revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company s internal organization; (iii) reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (iv)

 application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control; (v) adjustment to provision amounts in connection with a prior business combination; and (vi) revision for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits or other changes in capital structure. Adopted by the Board of Directors on September 7, 2023.
