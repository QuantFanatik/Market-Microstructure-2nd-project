 CAUTIONARY STATEME NT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning set forth in United States securities laws and regulations that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business, financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimates, expect, future, intend, may, plan, see, seek, strategy, or will or the negative thereof or any variation thereon or similar terminology or expressions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We have developed our forward-looking statements based on management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn rely upon information available to them at the time such statements were made. Such forward-looking statements reflect our current perspectives on our business, future performance, existing trends and information as of the date of this report. These include, but are not limited to, our beliefs about future revenue and expense levels, growth rates, prospects related to our strategic initiatives and business strategies, along with express or implied assumptions about, among other things: our continued relationships with our strategic operating partners; the performance of our historic business, as well as the businesses we have recently acquired, at levels consistent with recent trends and reflective of the synergies we believe will be available to us as a result of such acquisitions; our ability to successfully integrate our recently acquired businesses; our ability to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and secure the financing necessary to complete such acquisitions; transportation costs remaining in-line with recent levels and expected trends; our ability to mitigate, to the best extent possible, our dependence on current management and certain larger strategic operating partners; our compliance with financial and other covenants under our indebtedness; the absence of any adverse laws or governmental regulations affecting the transportation industry in general, and our operations in particular; the impact of COVID-19 or any other health pandemic or environment event on our operations and financial results; continued disruptions in the global supply chain; higher inflationary pressures particularly surrounding the costs of fuel; labor and other components of our operations; potential adverse legal, reputational and financial effects on the Company resulting from the ransomware incident that we reported in December of 2021 or future cyber incidents and the effectiveness of the Company s business continuity plans in response to cyber incidents, like the ransomware incident; the commercial, reputational and regulatory risks to our business that may arise as a consequence of our need to restate our financial statements; our longer-term relationship with our senior lenders as a consequence of our need to restate our financial statements; our temporary loss of the use of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 to register securities in the future; any disruption to our business that may occur on a longer-term basis should we be unable to remediate during fiscal year 2024 certain material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, and such other factors that may be identified from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings and other public announcements including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Part 1 Item 1A of this report. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic or other unexpected health pandemics, may amplify many of these risks. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, as they speak only as of the date made. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 P ART I 
 I TEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Our Company 
 Radiant Logistics, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company, we or us ), operates as a third-party logistics company, providing technology-enabled global transportation and value-added logistics solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. We service a large and diversified account base across a range of industries and geographies, which is supported from an extensive network of operating locations across North America as well as an integrated international service partner network located in other key markets around the globe. The Company provides these services through a multi-brand network, which includes over 100 operating locations. Included in these operating locations are a number of independent agents, who are also referred to as strategic operating partners, that operate exclusively on the Company's behalf, and approximately 25 Company-owned offices. As a third-party logistics company, the Company has a vast carrier network of asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in its carrier network. We believe shippers value our services because we are able to objectively arrange the most efficient and cost-effective means, type and provider of transportation service without undue influence caused by the ownership of transportation assets. In addition, our minimal investment in physical assets affords us the opportunity for a higher return on invested capital and net cash flows than our asset-based competitors. 
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic, international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services, including truckload services, less than truckload LTL services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. Our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment, and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL, and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added logistics services including materials management and distribution services (collectively, materials management and distribution or MM D services), customs house brokerage CHB services and global trade management GTM services to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 The Company expects to grow its business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. The Company s organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships leveraging the benefit of the Company s technology platform, while continuing its efforts on the organic build-out of the Company s network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, as the Company continues to grow and scale its business, the Company believes that it is creating density in its trade lanes, which creates opportunities for the Company to more efficiently source and manage its transportation capacity. 
 In addition to its focus on organic growth, the Company will continue to search for acquisition candidates that bring critical mass from a geographic and purchasing power standpoint, along with providing complementary service offerings to the current platform. As the Company continues to grow and scale its business, it also remains focused on leveraging its back-office infrastructure and technology systems to drive productivity improvement across the organization. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 As a non-asset-based third-party logistics provider, we believe that we are well-positioned to provide cost-effective and efficient solutions to address the demand in the marketplace for transportation and logistics services. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry are quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise and convenience, scope of operations, geographic coverage, information technology and price. We believe our primary competitive advantages are as follows: 
 Non-asset-based business model 
 As a non-asset-based logistics provider, we own only a minimal amount of equipment. By not owning the transportation equipment used to transport the freight, which results in relatively minimal fixed operating costs, we are able to leverage our network of locations to offer competitive pricing and flexible solutions to our customers. Moreover, our balanced product offering provides us with revenue streams from multiple sources and enables us to retain customers even as they shift across various modes of transportation. We believe our low capital intensity model allows us to provide low-cost solutions to our customers, operate our business with strong cash flow characteristics, and retain significant flexibility in responding to changing industries and economic conditions.

 Offer significant advantages to our strategic operating partners 
 Our current network is predominantly represented by independent agents, who operate exclusively on our behalf, who we also refer to as our strategic operating partners, who rely on us for operating authority, technology, sales and marketing support, access to working capital, our carrier and international partner networks, and collective purchasing power. Through this collaboration, our strategic operating partners have the ability to focus on the operational and sales support aspects of their business without diverting costs or expertise to the structural aspect of their operations, thus, providing our strategic operating partners with the regional, national and global brand recognition that they would not otherwise be able to achieve acting alone. 
 Lower-risk operation of network of strategic operating partners 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue pursuant to agreements with our strategic operating partners operating under our various brands. These arrangements afford us with a relatively low risk growth model as each strategic operating partner is responsible for its own sales and costs of operations. Under shared economic arrangements, we are responsible to provide to our strategic operating partners centralized back-office infrastructure, transportation and accounting systems, billing and collection services. 
 Diverse customer base 
 We service a large and diversified account base consisting of consumer goods, food and beverage, electronics and high-tech, aviation and automotive, military and government, and manufacturing and retail customers. For the annual period up to the date of this report, no single customer and no strategic operating partner represented more than 5 of our consolidated revenue, reducing risks associated with any particular industry, geographic or customer concentration. 
 Information technology resources 
 A primary component of our business strategy is the continued development of advanced information systems to provide accurate and timely information to our management, strategic operating partners and customers. We believe that the ability to provide accurate real-time information on the status of shipments has and will become increasingly important in our industry. Our customer delivery tools enable connectivity with our customers and trading partners systems, which leads to more accurate and up-to-date information on the status of shipments. Our centralized transportation management system (rating, routing, tender and financial settlement process) drives significant efficiency across our network. Through our December 2021 acquisition of Navegate we now also have access to a proprietary global trade management platform that will provide purchase order and vendor management tools that unlock SKU-level visibility from the manufacturing floor in Asia through final delivery in the U.S. We believe this will allow us to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and provide additional support for both current and prospective customers. 
 Global network of transportation providers 
 We provide worldwide supply chain services, which include international air and ocean services that complement our domestic service offerings. Our offerings include heavyweight and small package air services, providing same day (next flight out) air charters, next day a.m./p.m., second day a.m./p.m. as well as time-definite surface transport moves. Our non-asset-based business model allows us to use commercial passenger and cargo flights. Thus, we have thousands of daily flight options to choose from, and our pickup and delivery network provides us with zip code to zip code coverage throughout North America. 
 Sourcing and managing transportation 
 As we continue to grow and scale the business, we expect to continue to develop density in our trade lanes, which creates opportunities for us to more efficiently source and manage our transportation capacity. Through acquisitions, our network also has access to truck brokerage and intermodal capabilities. We believe the benefit of our relative purchasing power along with our service line expansion will serve as a competitive differentiator in the marketplace to help us secure new customers and attract additional strategic operating partners to our network. 
 Value-added services 
 In addition to our core transportation service offerings, we also provide value-added supply chain services including MM D, CHB, and GTM services. We believe that our value-added services allow us to leverage our transportation services to generate additional revenue and provide additional convenience to our customers.

 Industry Overview 
 The logistics industry is highly fragmented with thousands of companies of various sizes competing in the domestic and international markets. As business requirements for efficient and cost-effective logistics services have increased, so has the importance and complexity of effectively managing freight transportation. Businesses increasingly strive to minimize inventory levels, perform manufacturing and assembly operations in the lowest cost locations, and distribute their products in numerous global markets. As a result, companies are increasingly looking to third-party logistics providers to help them execute their supply chain strategies. 
 Shippers typically manage their supply chains using some combination of asset and non-asset-based service providers. We operate principally as a non-asset-based third-party logistics provider focused on freight forwarding, truck brokerage and intermodal transportation services, along with associated value-added services. According to Statista, the market for third-party logistics services in the United States and Canada is estimated at approximately 309.2 billion annually. 
 Because non-asset-based companies select from various transportation options in routing customer shipments, they are often able to serve customers less expensively and with greater flexibility than their asset-based competitors, who are typically focused on maximizing the utilization of their own captive fleets of trucks, aircraft and ships rather than the specific needs of the customer. 
 We believe there are several factors that are increasing demand for global logistics solutions. These factors include: 
 outsourcing of non-core activities; 

globalization of trade; 

increased need for time-definite delivery; 

consolidation of global logistics providers; and 

increasing influence of e-business and the Internet.

 Our objective is to provide customers with comprehensive multi-modal transportation and logistics solutions offered by us through our Radiant , Airgroup , Adcom , DBA , Service by Air , Navegate and Centrade brands. Since inception of our business in 2006, we have executed a strategy to expand operations through a combination of organic growth and the strategic acquisition of non-asset-based transportation and logistics providers meeting our acquisition criteria.

Cascade ), a privately held company based in Minnesota that has operated as a strategic operating partner under the Company s Airgroup brand since 2007 that provides a full range of domestic and international transportation and logistics services across North America, in 2022. 

We expect to grow our business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. We will continue to make enhancements to our back-office infrastructure, transportation management, global trade management and accounting systems to support this growth. Our organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships, while continuing our efforts on the organic build-out of our network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, we will also be working to drive further productivity improvements enabled through our value-added truck brokerage and customs house brokerage service capabilities. 
 Our acquisition strategy has been designed to take advantage of shifting market dynamics. The third-party logistics industry continues to grow as an increasing number of businesses outsource their logistics functions to more cost-effectively manage and extract value from their supply chains. The industry is positioned for further consolidation as it remains highly fragmented, and as customers are demanding the types of sophisticated and broad reaching service offerings that can more effectively be handled by larger more diverse organizations. We believe the highly fragmented composition of the marketplace, the industry participants need for capital, and their owners desire for liquidity has and will continue to produce a large number of attractive acquisition candidates. For the most part, our target acquisition candidates are generally smaller than those identified as acquisition targets of larger public companies and have limited ability to conduct their own public offerings or obtain financing that will provide them with capital for liquidity or rapid growth. We believe that many of these smaller companies are receptive to our acquisition program as a vehicle for liquidation or growth. We intend to be opportunistic in executing our acquisition strategy with a goal of expanding both our domestic and international capabilities. 
 Our Operating Strategy 
 Leverage the People, Process and Technology Available through a Central Platform . A key element of our operating strategy is to maximize our operational efficiencies by integrating general and administrative functions into our back-office operations and reducing or eliminating redundant functions and facilities at acquired companies. This is designed to enable us to quickly realize potential savings and synergies, efficiently control and monitor operations of acquired companies, and allow acquired companies to focus on growing their sales and operations. 
 Develop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships . We seek to develop and maintain strong interactive customer relationships by anticipating and focusing on our customers needs. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business, rather than the transaction or assignment-oriented approach used by many of our competitors. To develop close customer relationships, we and our network of operating partners regularly meet with both existing and prospective customers to help design solutions for, and identify the resources needed to execute, their supply chain strategies. We believe that this relationship-oriented approach results in greater customer satisfaction and reduced business development expense.

 Operations 
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services including truckload services, LTL services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. As a third-party logistics provider, our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added supply chain services, including MM D, CHB, and GTM, to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 As a non-asset-based provider, we generally do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight. We generally expect to neither own nor operate any material transportation assets and, consequently, arrange for transportation of our customers shipments via trucking companies, commercial airlines, air cargo carriers, railroads, ocean carriers and other non-asset-based third-party providers. We select the carrier for a shipment based on route, departure time, available cargo capacity and cost. We may charter cargo aircraft and/or ocean vessels from time to time depending upon seasonality, freight volumes and other factors. We generate our gross margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the services provided to them, and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport the freight. 
 We are organized functionally in two geographic operating segments: U.S. and Canada. Our transportation services for both the U.S. and Canada segments can be broadly placed into the categories of freight forwarding and freight brokerage services: 
 Freight forwarding . As a freight forwarder, we operate as a non-asset-based carrier providing domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services. Our freight forwarding operations involve obtaining shipment or material orders from customers, creating and delivering a wide range of logistics solutions to meet customers' specific requirements for transportation and related services, and arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We arrange for transportation of our customers shipments via trucking companies, commercial airlines, air cargo carriers, ocean carriers and other asset-based and non-asset-based third-party providers. We select the carrier for a shipment based on route, departure time, available cargo capacity and cost. We charter cargo aircraft from time to time depending upon seasonality, freight volumes and other factors. 
 Freight brokerage . We also provide significant bi-modal brokerage capabilities providing truckload, LTL and intermodal services throughout the United States and Canada, which is managed through our centralized service centers in Chicago, Illinois and Toronto, Ontario. We offer temperature-controlled, dry van, intermodal drayage, and flatbed services and specialize in the transport of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods and frozen food and refrigerated products. 
 As a truck broker, we match the customers needs with carriers capacity to provide the most effective combination of service and price. We have contracts with a substantial number of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. As part of the truck brokerage services, we negotiate rates, track shipments in-transit and handle claims for freight loss and damage on behalf of our customers. For our LTL service, we employ a point-to-point model that we believe serves as a competitive advantage over the traditional hub and spoke LTL model in terms of faster transit times, lower incidence of damage, and reduced fuel consumption. 
 As an intermodal services company, we arrange for the movement of our customers freight in containers, trailers and rail boxcars, typically over long distances of at least 750 miles. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies, known as drayage companies, for pickup and delivery. As part of our intermodal services, we negotiate rail and drayage rates, electronically track shipments in-transit, consolidate billing and handle claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of our customers. 
 To complement our core transportation service offerings, we also provide a number of value-added services, including MM D, CHB, and GTM solutions. 
 Information Services 
 The continued enhancement of our information systems and ultimate migration of acquired companies and additional strategic operating partners to a common set of customer-facing and back-office applications is a key component of our growth strategy. We believe that the ability to provide accurate real-time information on the status of shipments as well as enhanced reporting and visibility tools has become increasingly important and that our efforts in this area will result in competitive service advantages. Through our December 2021 acquisition of Navegate we are also now able to offer customers purchase order and vendor management tools that unlock SKU-level visibility from the manufacturing floor in Asia through final delivery here in the U.S through our proprietary global trade management platform which we believe this will allow us to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. In addition, we believe that centralizing our operations into a single transportation management system (rating, routing, tender and financial settlement processes) will continue to drive significant productivity improvement across our network.

 In our forwarding operations, we use a third-party and proprietary transportation management system (Cargowise, SBA Review) and are migrating operations to SAP TM, which are integrated to our third-party accounting system (SAP ECC). These systems combine to form the foundation of our supply-chain technologies, which provides us with a common set of back-office operating, accounting and customer facing applications. In our brokerage operations, we utilize the TEDS system for transportation management and Megatrans and Revenova for intermodal services, and Profit Tools for drayage services. In our warehousing operations, we use Microsoft s Navision and are migrating to Highjump, which uses SAP for order management services. These systems are connected to Epicor and JD Edwards for accounting and financial reporting. We continue to make gradual progress in migrating these various operating and financial reporting systems to a singular SAP-based platform. We are taking a phased approach to these migrations and currently we continue to transition our freight forwarding services to our SAP-based transportation management system. Future phases will include the transition of our legacy brokerage transportation management and financial reporting systems to SAP ECC. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We principally market our services through our network of Company-owned and strategic operating partner locations across North America. Each office is staffed with operational employees to provide support for the sales team, develop frequent contact with the customer s traffic department, and perform customer service. Our current network is predominantly represented by strategic operating partners that rely on us for operating authority, technology, sales and marketing support, access to working capital, our carrier and international partners networks, and collective purchasing power. Through this collaboration, our strategic operating partners have the ability to focus on the operational and sales support aspects of the business without diverting costs or expertise to the structural aspect of their operations, providing our partners with the regional, national and global brand recognition that they would not otherwise be able to achieve by solely serving their local market. We have no customers or strategic operating partners that separately account for more than 5 of our consolidated revenue, although we do have a number of significant customers and strategic operating partner locations with volume and stature, the loss of one or more of which could negatively impact our ability to retain and service our customers. 
 Competition and Business Conditions 
 The logistics business is directly impacted by the volume of domestic and international trade. The volume of such trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, major work stoppages, currency fluctuations, acts of war, terrorism and other armed conflicts, United States and international laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments, interest rates, inflation, and taxation. 
 The global transportation and logistics services industry is intensively competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We compete against asset-based and other non-asset-based third-party logistics companies, consultants, information technology vendors and shippers transportation departments. This competition is based primarily on rates, quality of service (such as damage-free shipments, on-time delivery and consistent transit times), reliable pickup and delivery and scope of operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do. However, we believe the incremental service offerings enabled through our acquisition strategy (e.g., Navegate s global trade management platform) will serve as a catalyst for margin expansion in our existing business and a competitive differentiator in the marketplace to help us secure new customers and attract additional strategic operating partners to our network. 
 Regulation 
 Interstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business. Some of the regulations affecting our current and prospective operations are described below. 
 Air freight forwarding operations are subject to regulation, as an indirect air cargo carrier, under the Federal Aviation Act as enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security. While air freight forwarders are exempted from most of the Federal Aviation Act s requirements by the Economic Aviation Regulations, the industry is subject to ongoing regulatory and legislative developments that can impact the economics of the industry by requiring changes to operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of, providing services to customers. 
 Surface freight forwarding operations are subject to various state and federal statutes and are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation and, to a very limited extent, the Surface Transportation Board. These federal agencies have broad investigatory and regulatory powers, including the power to issue a certificate of authority or license to engage in the business, to approve specified mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and to regulate the delivery of some types of domestic shipments and operations within particular geographic areas.

 Table of Contents 
 
 The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also has the authority to regulate interstate motor carrier operations, including the regulation of certain rates, charges and accounting systems, to require periodic financial reporting, and to regulate insurance, driver qualifications, operation of motor vehicles, parts and accessories for motor vehicle equipment, hours of service of drivers, inspection, repair, maintenance standards and other safety related matters. The federal laws governing interstate motor carriers have both direct and indirect application to the Company. The breadth and scope of the federal regulations may affect our operations and the motor carriers that are used in the provisioning of the transportation services. In certain locations, state or local permits or registrations may also be required to provide or obtain intrastate motor carrier services. 
 The Federal Maritime Commission, or FMC, regulates and licenses ocean forwarding operations. Non-vessel operating common carriers are subject to FMC regulation, under the FMC tariff filing and surety bond requirements, and under the Shipping Act of 1984, particularly those terms proscribing rebating practices. 
 United States customs brokerage operations are subject to the licensing requirements of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, any customs brokerage operations must also be licensed in and subject to the regulations of countries into which freight is imported. 
 Environmental, Social, and Governance Initiatives 
 We seek to maintain best-in-class level of corporate governance on behalf of our stakeholders, including our associates, customers, consumers, communities, and shareholders. We also recognize the importance of environmental and social factors related to how we operate our business. We are continuing to enhance and consolidate our Environmental, Social, and Governance ESG efforts and accelerate programs related to Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion DEI ); as well as community action and good corporate citizenship. 
 The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of ESG-related matters, including climate change risks and opportunities. Radiant has over the past year, additionally, launched our ESG Steering Committee as well as most recently our Radiant ESG Task Force: a working group that includes both operational and administrative representatives from across our business. The ultimate goal of the ESG Steering Committee is to lead the development and implementation of our strategic ESG plan, while our ESG Task Force will further seek opportunities to educate our organization on standards and recommendations, as well as adapt for the future success in our environmental, social and overall governance related endeavors. 
 In our Annual Report for 2022, we took strides to provide further transparency on our commitment and progress towards our ESG and sustainability initiatives. Since then, we have continued to work with an external ESG consultant as we further explore our alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD as well as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB and in the areas of climate and greenhouse gas emissions, similar alignment with the Science Based Target initiative. Recognizing that we must work to reduce our emissions across the organization, we have begun an initial carbon inventory to better inform our greenhouse gasses GHG initiatives, which we expect to be completed in the coming months. As we continue to work through and develop best practices in minimizing the negative effects of our industry on the environment, we intend to (1) report on our data in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, (2) execute on both an Environmental Management Policy and a Sustainable Procurement Policy, and (3) establish targets for reduction of GHG emissions and our carbon footprint, with consideration to Science Based Targets initiative STBi alignment. 
 In 2022 Radiant also highlighted our ongoing commitment to being a socially responsible employer, fostering an environment of diversity and inclusion across our business, operating ethically and supporting our local communities. In furtherance of this commitment, in 2023 we launched a long-term partnership with the American Heart Association. In addition, we have continued to seek partnerships with organizations like Packed with Purpose, likewise committed to the goal of lifting up local communities. 
 We believe progress on our ESG initiatives will have a positive impact on our shareholders, consumers, customers, our talented worldwide associates, and the communities in which we are proud to live and work.

 I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 RISKS PARTICULAR TO OUR BUSINESS 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The future trading price of shares of our common stock will be affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. 
 Risks Related to our Business 
 We need to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner network to increase revenues. 
 We sell our services through Company-owned locations operating under the Radiant brands and through a network of independently owned strategic operating partners throughout North America operating under the Airgroup, Adcom, DBA, and Service by Air brands. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately 48 and 49 of our consolidated adjusted gross profit (this is a non-GAAP measure, see further discussion and reconciliation to a GAAP measure in Item 7) was derived through our strategic operating partners. We believe our strategic operating partners will remain a critical component to our success for the foreseeable future. Although the terms of our strategic operating partner agreements vary widely, they generally cover the manner and amount of payments, the services to be performed, the length of the contract, and provide us with certain protections such as strategic operating partner-funded reserves against potential bad debts, indemnification obligations, and in certain instances include a personal guaranty of the independent owner(s) of the strategic operating partners. Certain of our strategic operating partner agreements are for defined terms, while others are subject to evergreen terms, or contain automatic renewal provisions or are at-will on a month-to-month basis. Regardless of stated term, in most situations the agreements can be terminated by the strategic operating partner with prior notice. As certain agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into new agreements that provide for the same terms and economics as those previously agreed upon, if at all. Thus, we are subject to the risk of strategic operating partner terminations and the failure or refusal of certain of our strategic operating partners to renew their existing agreements. This risk is often accentuated upon the acquisition of a new agency-based network. We have a number of customers and strategic operating partner locations with significant volume and stature; however, no single customer or strategic operating partner location represents more than 5 of our consolidated revenue. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner relationships or enter into new strategic operating partner relationships, or that new or renewed strategic operating partner relationships will be available on commercially reasonable terms. If we are unable to maintain and expand our existing strategic operating partner relationships, renew existing strategic operating partner relationships, or enter into new strategic operating partner relationships, we may lose customers, customer introductions and co-marketing benefits, and our operating results may be negatively impacted. We may also be restricted from growing in certain territories or with certain customers, except through our strategic operating partners. 
 If our strategic operating partners fail to maintain adequate reserves against unpaid customer invoices, or if we are unable to offset against commissions earned and payable by us to our strategic operating partners for unpaid customer invoices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue pursuant to agreements with strategic operating partners operating under our various brands. Under these agreements, each individual strategic operating partner is responsible for some or all of the collection of amounts due from customers being serviced by such strategic operating partner. Certain of our strategic operating partners are required to maintain a security deposit with us to be used to fund those customer accounts ultimately not collected by us. We charge each of the strategic operating partners for any accounts receivable aged beyond 90 days. If the strategic operating partner s deposit with us has been depleted, an amount will be owed to us by our strategic operating partner. Based on legacy contracts assumed upon acquisition, some strategic operating partners are not required to maintain a security deposit, however, they are still responsible for deficits and their strategic operating partner agreements provide that we may withhold all or a portion of future commissions payable to the strategic operating partner in satisfaction of any deficit. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 1.7 million was owed to us by our strategic operating partners. To the extent any of these strategic operating partners cease operations or are otherwise unable to replenish these deficit accounts, we would be at risk of loss for any such amount. We include such amounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable the amounts owed will not be collected.

 Failure to comply with obligations as an indirect air carrier could result in penalties and fines and limit our ability to ship freight. 
 We are regulated, among other things, as indirect air carriers by the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security. These agencies provide requirements, guidance and, in some cases, administer licensing requirements and processes applicable to the freight forwarding industry. We monitor our compliance and the compliance of our subsidiaries with such agency requirements. We rely on our strategic operating partners to monitor their own compliance, except when we are notified of a violation, when we may become involved. Failure to comply with these requirements, policies and procedures could result in penalties and fines. To date, a limited number of our strategic operating partners have been out of compliance with the indirect air carrier regulations, resulting in fines to us, which we attempt to collect from the strategic operating partners. There is no assurance that additional violations will not take place, which could result in penalties or fines or, in the extreme case, limits on our ability to ship freight. 
 Our business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate information technology systems. 
 We rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology platform in response to these trends that may lead to significant ongoing software development or licensing costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our customers and strategic operating partners and the trends in the transportation services industry, or to design or license and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology platform in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. Despite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, Acts of God , data leakage and human error pose direct threats to our information technology systems and operations. 
 We have been and may in the future be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. For example, as previously disclosed, on December 8, 2021, we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our operational and information technology systems. Even though we recovered our systems and returned our operations to full functionality, the incident did result in a loss of revenue as well as certain incremental costs. Furthermore, we have yet to determine the extent to which our insurance may cover such costs. In addition, following an extensive forensic investigation by a full team of cybersecurity experts, we confirmed that some data extraction related to the Company s customers and employees occurred from the Company s servers before the Company took its systems offline. We notified law enforcement, provided notice to customers apprising them of the situation and provided notices required by applicable law related to potential Personal Identifiable Information PII data exposure. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or to prevent or remediate a cyber-attack could result in corruption or loss of our data, service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to customers or others, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. Additionally, the insurance coverage we have in place may not apply to particular loss or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which we may be subject. We must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer or businesses we acquire, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. We expect customers and strategic operating partners to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their supply chain services providers. If we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers and strategic operating partners demands, our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers. 
 In addition, acquired companies will need to be integrated with our information technology systems, which may cause additional training or licensing cost, along with potential delays and disruption. In such event, our revenue, financial results and ability to operate profitably could be negatively impacted. The challenges associated with integration of our acquisitions may increase these risks. 
 Our management information and financial reporting systems are spread across diverse platforms and geographies. 
 The growth of our business through acquisitions has resulted in our reliance on the accounting, business information, and other computer systems of these acquired entities to capture and transmit information concerning customer orders, carrier payment, payroll, and other critical business data. We continue to make progress towards migrating our various legacy operating and accounting systems to a singular SAP-based system. As long as an acquired business remains on another information technology system, we face additional manual calculations, training costs, delays, and an increased possibility of inaccuracies in the data we use to manage our business and report our financial results. Any delay in compiling, assessing, and reporting information could adversely impact our business, our ability to timely react to changes in volumes, prices, or other trends, or to take actions to comply with financial covenants, all of which could negatively impact our stock price.

 We depend on third-party carriers to transport our customers cargo. 
 We rely on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators, ocean freight carriers, trucking companies, major U.S. railroads, other transportation companies, draymen and longshoremen for the movement of our customers cargo. Consequently, our ability to provide services for our customers could be adversely impacted by, among other things: shortages in available cargo capacity; changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling, pricing, payment terms and frequency of service, increases in the cost of fuel, taxes and labor, changes in the financial stability or operating capabilities of carriers, and other factors not within our control. Reductions in airfreight or ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields. Material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation, whether caused by supply chain irregularities, strike, work stoppage, lock-out, slowdown, other supply chain issues or otherwise, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, any determination that our third-party carriers have violated laws and regulations could seriously damage our reputation and brands, resulting in diminished revenue and profit and increased operating costs. 
 Our profitability depends on our ability to effectively manage our cost structure as we grow the business. 
 We have increased, and intend to further increase, our revenue through organic growth, adding strategic operating partners, and acquisitions. We believe that certain of our costs, such as those related to information technology, physical locations, senior management, and sales and general operations, and excluding non-cash amortization, should grow more slowly than our adjusted gross profit, which would lead to improved cash flow margins over time. Historically, our cash flow margins have fluctuated, and have not always improved as we have grown. To the extent we fail to manage our costs, including purchased transportation, strategic operating partner commissions, personnel expenses, and sales and general expenses, our profitability may not improve or may decrease. This could adversely impact our business, results of operation, financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock. 
 Economic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, inflation pressures, and other economic factors beyond our control. Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals, and which may include the following: 
 a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected; 

some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase; 

a significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers; and 

we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. In addition, we have other primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand. 

COVID-19 or other health crises may adversely affect our business. 
 The outbreak of COVID-19 and variants of the virus continue to evolve. Although the effects have lessened over time, there is uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time with new strains frequently being discovered. 
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumers, business, and government spending as well as customers' ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance.

 Our business is subject to seasonal trends. 
 Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. Our first and fourth fiscal quarters are traditionally weaker compared with our second and third fiscal quarters. As a result, our quarterly operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate. This trend is dependent on numerous factors, including the markets in which we operate, holiday seasons, climate, economic conditions, inflationary pressure, and numerous other factors. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand, which can sometimes be difficult to predict or are based on just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, our revenue is, to a large degree, affected by factors that are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors. 
 Comparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. 
 Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control including inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to economic trends, such as inflation and supply chain irregularities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and consumer demand that can be difficult to predict or are based on just-in-time production schedules. Because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly, comparisons of our results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. Additionally, the timing of acquisitions, as well as the revenue and expenses of the acquired operations, the transaction expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and interest expense associated with acquisitions can make our operating results from period to period difficult to compare. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our historical operating patterns will continue in future periods or that comparisons to prior periods will be meaningful. 
 Higher carrier prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit. 
 Carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant, including increased costs of fuel, labor shortages, increased shipping times due to supply chain disruptions in order to cover higher operating expenses such as increased shipping times, labor rates, and rising gas prices. Our adjusted gross profit and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. Increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing. 
 We face intense competition in the freight forwarding, freight brokerage, logistics and supply chain management industry. 
 The freight forwarding, freight brokerage, logistics and supply chain management industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We face competition from a number of companies, including many that have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Customers increasingly are turning to competitive bidding processes, in which they solicit bids from a number of competitors, including competitors that are larger than us. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following: 
 competition with other transportation services companies, some of which have a broader coverage network, a wider range of services, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do; 

reduction by our competitors of their rates to gain business, especially during times of declining growth rates in the economy, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins or maintain significant growth in our business; 

shift in the business of shippers to asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity; 

solicitation by shippers of bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors; and 

establishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs.

 Our industry is consolidating and if we cannot gain sufficient market presence, we may not be able to compete successfully against larger companies in our industry. 
 There currently is a trend within our industry towards consolidation of the niche players into larger companies that are attempting to increase global operations through the acquisition of regional and local freight forwarders, brokers, and other freight logistics providers. If we cannot gain sufficient market presence or otherwise establish a successful strategy in our industry, we may not be able to compete successfully against larger companies in our industry. 
 If we are not able to limit our liability for customers claims for loss or damage to their goods through contract terms and limit our exposure through the purchase of insurance, we could be required to pay large amounts to our customers as compensation for their claims and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 In our freight forwarding operations, we have liability under law to our customers for loss or damage to their goods. We attempt to limit our exposure through release limits, indemnification by the air, ocean, and ground carriers that transport the freight, and insurance. Moreover, because a freight forwarder relationship to an airline or ocean carrier is that of a shipper to a carrier, the airline or ocean carrier generally assumes the same responsibility to us as we assume to our customers. When we act in the capacity of an authorized agent for an air or ocean carrier, the carrier, rather than us, assumes liability for the safe delivery of the customer s cargo to its ultimate destination, unless due to our own errors and omissions. However, these efforts may prove unsuccessful, and we may be liable for loss and damage to the goods. 
 In addition to legal liability, from time to time customers exert economic pressure when the underlying carrier fails to cover the costs of loss or damage. We have, from time to time, made payments to our customers for claims related to our services and may make such payments in the future. Should we experience an increase in the number or size of such claims or an increase in liability pursuant to claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims, our results could be adversely affected. 
 There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will provide us with adequate coverage for such claims or that the maximum amounts for which we are liable in connection with our services will not change in the future or exceed our insurance levels. As with every insurance policy, there are limits, exclusions and deductibles that apply, and we could be subject to claims for which insurance coverage may be inadequate or even disputed and such claims could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, continued increases in the cost of insurance costs impact our profitability. 
 We may be subject to claims arising from transportation of freight by the carriers with which we contract. 
 We use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in death or serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded from or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination. 
 We are subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures. 
 Our business exposes us to claims and litigation related to damage to cargo, labor and employment practices (including wage-and-hour, employment classification of independent contractor drivers, sales representatives, brokerage agents and other individuals, and other federal and state claims), personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters. We carry insurance to cover most exposures, subject to specific coverage exceptions, aggregate limits, and self-insured retentions that we negotiate from time to time. However, not all claims are covered, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, or involve significant aggregate use of our self-insured retention amounts, the expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the quarter in which the amounts are accrued. In addition, in the future, we may be subject to higher insurance premiums or increase our self-insured retention amounts, which could increase our overall costs or the volatility of claims expense.

 Our failure to comply with, or the costs of complying with, government regulation could negatively affect our results of operation. 
 Our business is subject to evolving, complex and increasing regulation by national and international sources. Regulatory changes could affect the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of providing, services to customers. Future regulation and our failure to comply with any applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The motor carriers we contract with are subject to increasingly restrictive laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Future and existing environmental regulatory requirements could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. If we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services. 
 If we are unable to maintain our brand images and corporate reputation, our business may suffer. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the Radiant, Airgroup, Adcom, DBA, Service by Air, and Navegate brands and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers. Service quality issues, actual or perceived, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other freight-forwarding companies. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors, suppliers, agents or others with whom we do business could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands. 
 Issues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We use both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the user of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third-parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third-party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against us either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations. 
 We also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third-parties or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Given our international operations, we seek to register our trademarks and other intellectual property domestically and internationally. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time consuming and costly, distract management s attention and resources and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities. 
 Our failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not successfully manage our growth. 
 We intend to grow rapidly and substantially, including by expanding our internal resources, by making acquisitions and entering into new markets. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets and change in revenue and business models. 
 Our growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will increase substantially as our operations grow. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, stock price and financial condition.

 Our loans and credit facilities contain financial covenants that may limit current availability and impose ongoing operational limitations and risk of compliance. 
 We currently maintain (i) a USD 200 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and BMO Capital Markets Corp. as joint book runners and joint lead arrangers, Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of Montreal as syndication agent, KeyBank National Association and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. as co-documentation agents and Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, KeyBank National Association, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and Washington Federal Bank, National Association as lenders (such named lenders are collectively referred to herein as Lenders ), pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022, (ii) a CAD 29 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund IV LP FPD IV formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund IV LP) pursuant to a CAD 29,000,000 Credit Facilities Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the FPD IV Loan Agreement ), and (iii) a CAD 10 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund V LP FPD V formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund V LP) pursuant to a CAD 10,000,000 Credit Facilities Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the FPD V Loan Agreement and, together with the FPD IV Loan Agreement, the FPD Loan Agreements ). Repayment of the foregoing credit facilities is secured by our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, including, without limitation, all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility includes a 75 million accordion feature to support future acquisition opportunities. For general borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00 and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00. Additional minimum availability requirements and financial covenants apply in the event the Company seeks to use advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to pursue acquisitions or repurchase its common stock. 
 Our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities is particularly important given the materiality of such facilities to our day-to-day operations and overall acquisition strategy. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to secure a waiver or other relief, our financial condition would be materially weakened and our ability to fund day-to-day operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, we employ EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as management tools to measure our historical financial performance and as a benchmark for future financial flexibility. 
 We may operate with a significant amount of indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our assets and subject to variable interest rates and restrictive covenants. 
 Substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, such as: 
 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness with our lenders, which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future operating capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; 

require us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so; 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; 

restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, buying assets or pursuing business opportunities; and 

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds. 

In addition, violating covenants in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consequences if the violations are not cured or waived could include substantially increasing our cost of borrowing, restricting our future operations, termination of our lenders commitments to supply us with further funds, cross defaults to other obligations, or acceleration of our obligations. If some or all of our obligations are accelerated, we may not be able to fully repay them. 
 Dependence on key personnel. 
 For the foreseeable future, our success will depend largely on the continued services of our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bohn H. Crain, as well as certain of our other key executives and executives of our acquired businesses because of their collective industry knowledge, marketing skills and relationships with vendors, customers and strategic operating partners. Our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model. Should any of these individuals leave us, we could have difficulty replacing them with qualified individuals and it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. 
 Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of this report). Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.

 Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, anti-terrorism measures or war may affect our operations and our profitability. 
 As a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including, among others, checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our independent contractors and transportation providers or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. For example, security measures imposed at bridges, tunnels, border crossings and other points on key trucking routes may cause delays and increase the non-driving time of our independent contractors and transportation providers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We also have higher costs due to mandated security screening of air cargo traveling on passenger airlines and ocean freight. War, risk of war, or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future. 
 We intend to continue growing our international operations and will become increasingly subject to variations in the international trade market. 
 We provide services to customers engaged in international commerce and intend to grow our international business in the coming years. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, international services accounted for 41 and 48 of our adjusted gross profit, respectively. International services is defined as any shipment with an initiation or destination point outside of the United States. All factors that affect international trade have the potential to expand or contract our international business and impact our operating results. For example, international trade is influenced by, among other things: 
 currency exchange rates and currency control regulations; 

interest rate fluctuations; 

changes in governmental policies, such as taxation, quota restrictions, tariffs, other forms of trade barriers and/or restrictions and trade accords; 

changes in and application of international and domestic customs, trade and security regulations; 

wars, strikes, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts, such as the conflict that has led to the imposition of economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union against Russia; 

natural disasters and pandemics; 

changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own; 

changes in availability of credit; 

economic conditions in other countries and regions; 

changes in supply chain design including those resulting from near shoring, widening and deepening of canals, and port congestion or disruption; 

changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleum-related products; and 

increased global concerns regarding environmental sustainability. 

If any of the foregoing factors have a negative effect on the international trade market, we could suffer a decrease in our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In connection with our international business, we are subject to certain foreign regulatory requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could be detrimental to our business. 
 We provide services in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anti-corruption laws, rules, regulations and decrees of the United States, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and of all other countries in which we conduct business; as well as trade control laws, or laws, regulations and Executive Orders imposing embargoes and sanctions; and anti-boycott laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees, subcontractors, consultants, agents, third-party brokers and customers, whose individual actions could violate these laws, rules, regulations and decrees. Failure to comply could result in substantial penalties, damages to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business. In addition, any investigation or litigation related to such violations may require significant management time and could cause us to incur extensive legal and related costs, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows.

 International operations expose us to currency exchange risk, and we cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and operating results. 
 We generate a significant portion of revenues from our international operations, including a substantial amount in Canada. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, international services accounted for 41 and 48 of our adjusted gross profit, respectively. Our international operations are sensitive to currency exchange risks. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as well as intercompany transactions. Significant changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies in which we transact business and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have not entered into any hedging activities, and, to the extent that we continue not to do so in the future, we may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 In addition, our international operations also expose us to currency fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign operations to the U.S. dollar. There can be no guarantee that the effect of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. 
 We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to recording and processing of revenue transactions and our information technology general controls relating to change management and user access rights. Ineffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results as well as our public reporting and stock price. 
 We have grown rapidly and face additional challenges of disparate systems and geographically dispersed management. Our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure are strained at times due to COVID-19, acquisitions, and other corporate development activities. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. As further described in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 because of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to: (i) our controls with respect to the recording and processing of revenue as currently designed lack the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenue, and (ii) our information technology general controls, specifically relating to change management and user access rights. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are currently working on the remediation of these material weaknesses. For a more detailed description of the material weaknesses and our remediation plans, please see Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report. 
 We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses or that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. Any remediation efforts additionally may require us to incur unanticipated costs for various professional fees and services. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Material inaccuracies in our financial statements would decrease the reliability of our financial reporting, which could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and adversely affect our business and reduce our stock price. 
 We may be adversely affected by the physical effects of climate change as well as legal, regulatory, or market responses to climate change concerns. 
 Risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory, and political focus. Shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change may lead to an increase in the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures, or flooding, which could cause more significant business interruptions, increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenue than what we have experienced in the past from such events. In addition, increased public and political concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations. There is also a focus from regulators and our customers on sustainability issues. This focus may result in new legislation or customer requirements, including requirements for more fuel-efficient transportation, autonomous transportation modes, or increased transparency to carbon emissions in their supply chains. Costs associated with future climate change concerns or environmental laws and regulations and sustainability requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.

 Risks Related to our Acquisition Strategy 
 There is a scarcity of and competition for acquisition opportunities. 
 There are a limited number of operating companies available for acquisition that we deem to be desirable targets. In addition, there is a very high level of competition among companies seeking to acquire these operating companies. We are and will continue to be a very minor participant in the business of seeking acquisitions of these types of companies. A large number of established and well-financed entities are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find to be desirable acquisition candidates. Many of these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than us. Consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible acquisitions of these businesses. Even if we are able to successfully compete with these entities, this competition may affect the terms of completed transactions and, as a result, we may pay more or receive less favorable terms than we expected for potential acquisitions. We may not be able to identify operating companies that complement our strategy, and even if we identify a company that complements our strategy, we may be unable to complete an acquisition of such a company for many reasons, including: 
 failure to agree on the terms necessary for a transaction, such as the purchase price; 

incompatibility between our operational strategies or management philosophies with those of the potential acquiree; 

competition from other acquirers of operating companies; 

lack of sufficient capital to acquire a profitable logistics company; 

unwillingness of a potential acquiree to agree to subordinate any future payment of earn-outs or promissory notes to the payments due to our lenders; and 

unwillingness of a potential acquiree to work with our management. 

Risks related to acquisition financing. 
 We have a limited amount of financial resources and our ability to make additional acquisitions without securing additional financing from outside sources is limited. In order to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy, we may be required to obtain additional financing. We may obtain such financing through a combination of traditional debt financing or the placement of debt and equity securities. We may finance some portion of our future acquisitions by either issuing equity or by using shares of our common stock for all or a portion of the purchase price for such businesses. In the event that our common stock does not attain or maintain a sufficient market value, or potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the purchase price for the sale of their businesses, we may be required to use more of our cash resources, if available, in order to maintain our acquisition program. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, we will not be able to complete acquisitions and our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financing. The terms of our credit facility may require that we obtain the consent of our lenders prior to securing additional debt financing. There could be circumstances in which our ability to obtain additional debt financing could be constrained if we are unable to secure such consent. 
 The delayed filing of our annual report has made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions. 
 On May 9, 2022, we announced that our 150 million universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 had been declared effective by the SEC, which provided us with the continued financial flexibility to access capital. Our ability to raise capital under the Form S-3 depends upon several circumstances including staying up to date with our filing of audited financial statements, our financial and operating performance, and the capital market s receptiveness to our potential offerings. The need for restatement of previously issued financial statements delayed filings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. As such, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S 3 until one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition. 
 Our credit facilities place certain limits on the acquisitions we may make. 
 Under the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to obtain the consent of each of our lenders prior to making any additional acquisitions. 
 19 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 We are permitted to make additional acquisitions without the consent of the lenders only if certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions include the following: (i) no default shall have occurred or would result from such acquisition, (ii) the property acquired is used or useful in the same or a similar line of business as Radiant s, (iii) in the case of an acquisition of the equity interests, the board of directors of the target business shall have duly approved such Acquisition, (iv) we shall be in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to such acquisition and the consolidated leverage ratio shall be less than 3.25 to 1.00 for acquisitions valued above 25 million and 2.75 to 1.00 for any other acquisitions, (v) the representations and warranties made by Radiant in each loan document shall be true and correct, (vi) if such transaction involves the purchase of an interest in a partnership between Radiant as a general partner and entities unaffiliated with the borrower as the other partners, such transaction shall be effected by having such equity interest acquired by a corporate holding company directly or indirectly wholly-owned by Radiant newly formed for the sole purpose of effecting such transaction, and (vii) immediately after giving effect to such acquisition, there shall be at least 25 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 In the event we are not able to satisfy the conditions of our credit facilities in connection with a proposed acquisition, we must either forego the acquisition, obtain the consent of the lenders, or retire the credit facility. This may prevent us from completing acquisitions that we determine are desirable from a business perspective and limit or slow our ability to achieve the critical mass we need to achieve our strategic objectives. 
 To the extent we make any material acquisitions, our earnings will be adversely affected by non-cash charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, which may cause our stock price to decline. 
 Under applicable accounting standards, purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration paid in a business combination to the identified acquired assets and liabilities based on their fair values at the time of acquisition. The excess of the consideration paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible assets acquired must be allocated among identifiable intangible assets including goodwill. The amount allocated to goodwill is not subject to amortization. However, it is tested at least annually for impairment. The amount allocated to identifiable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and the like, is amortized over the life of these intangible assets. We expect that this will subject us to periodic charges against our earnings to the extent of the amortization incurred for that period. Because our business strategy focuses, in part, on growth through acquisitions, our future earnings will be subject to greater non-cash amortization charges than a company whose earnings are derived solely from organic growth. As a result, we will experience an increase in non-cash charges related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Our financial statements will show that our intangible assets are diminishing in value, even if the acquired businesses are increasing (or not diminishing) in value. Because of this discrepancy, we believe our EBITDA, a measure of financial performance that does not conform to GAAP, provides a meaningful measure of our financial performance. However, the investment community generally measures a public company s performance by its net income. Further, the financial covenants of our credit facility adjust EBITDA to exclude costs related to share-based compensation and other non-cash charges. Thus, we believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance. If the investment community elects to place more emphasis on net income, the future price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 We are not obligated to follow any particular criteria or standards for identifying acquisition candidates. 
 Other than as required under the credit facility, we are not obligated to follow any particular operating, financial, geographic or other criteria in evaluating candidates for potential acquisitions or business combinations. We will determine the purchase price and other terms and conditions of acquisitions. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that our management team will use and consider in deciding whether or not to enter into a particular transaction. 
 We may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to successfully implement our acquisition strategy. 
 Subject to the restrictions contained under our current credit facilities, we may be required to incur a significant amount of indebtedness in order to complete future acquisitions. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of acquired businesses to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on the indebtedness, then we will be required to use our capital for such payments. This will restrict our ability to make additional acquisitions. We may also be forced to sell an acquired business in order to satisfy indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably once we incur this indebtedness or that we will be able to generate a sufficient amount of proceeds from the ultimate disposition of such acquired businesses to repay the indebtedness incurred to make these acquisitions. 
 We may experience difficulties in integrating the operations, personnel and assets of acquired businesses that may disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results. 
 A core component of our business plan is to acquire businesses and assets in the transportation and logistics industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage businesses or successfully integrate acquired businesses into the Company without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. Such acquisitions also involve numerous operational risks, including: 
 difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; 

the diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; 

20 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 the risk of entering new markets; 

the potential loss of existing or acquired strategic operating partners following an acquisition; 

the potential loss of key employees following an acquisition and the associated risk of competitive efforts from such departed personnel; 

possible legal disputes with the acquired company following an acquisition; and 

the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs. 

As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute any acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. 
 In certain acquisitions, we may recognize non-cash gains or losses on changes in fair value of contingent consideration. We include contingent consideration based on future financial performance as a portion of the purchase price of certain acquisitions. To the extent that an acquired operation underperforms relative to anticipated earnings levels, we are able to set-off certain levels of future unpaid purchase price for such acquired operations. This will result in the recognition of a non-cash gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration. In the alternative, to the extent an acquired operation outperforms anticipated earnings levels, we will recognize a non-cash expense on the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These non-cash gains and expenses may have a material impact on our financial results, and the impact could be opposite to the underlying results of the acquired operation. 
 Not every acquisition is structured utilizing contingent consideration. Our fiscal year 2022 acquisition of Navegate was structured without using contingent consideration. We will be unable to reduce the purchase price of Navegate if it underperforms relative to anticipated earnings levels. 
 Claims against us or other liabilities we incur relating to any acquisition or business combination may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller s indemnification obligations. 
 There may be liabilities we assume in any acquisition or business combination that we did not discover or underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence investigation. A seller will normally have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, but these obligations will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and a cap, as well as time limitations. There can be no assurance that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 We may face competition from parties who sell us their businesses and from professionals who cease working for us. 
 In connection with our acquisitions, we generally obtain non-solicitation agreements from the professionals we hire, as well as non-competition agreements from senior managers and professionals. The agreements prohibit such individuals from competing with us during the term of their employment and for a fixed period afterwards and seeking to solicit our employees or clients. In some cases, but not all, we may obtain non-competition or non-solicitation agreements from parties who sell us their business or assets. Certain activities may be carved out of or otherwise may not be prohibited by these arrangements. We cannot assure that one or more of the parties from whom we acquire assets or a business or who do not join us or leave our employment will not compete with us or solicit our employees or clients in the future. Even if ultimately resolved in our favor, any litigation associated with the non-competition or non-solicitation agreements could be time consuming, costly and distract management s focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business. Moreover, non-competition agreements are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and states and foreign jurisdictions may interpret restrictions on competition narrowly and in favor of employees. 
 Therefore, certain restrictions on competition or solicitation may be unenforceable. In addition, we may not pursue legal remedies if we determine that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship with the former employee or his clients, or other concerns, outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recourse or the likelihood of success does not justify the costs of pursuing a legal remedy. Such persons, because they have worked for us or a business that we acquire, may be able to compete more effectively with us, or be more successful in soliciting our employees and clients, than unaffiliated third-parties. 
 Risks Related to our Common Stock 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock at times or at prices you find attractive. 
 The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. The current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. Fluctuations may occur in response to the other risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and for many other reasons, including: 
 actual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity, including those resulting from the seasonality of our business; 

21 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 our financial performance or the performance of our competitors and similar companies; 

the public s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; 

changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts; 

failure to meet securities analysts quarterly and annual projections; 

the impact of new federal or state regulations; 

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

the introduction of new services by us or our competitors; 

the arrival or departure of key personnel; 

acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors; 

technological innovations or other trends in our industry; 

news affecting our customers; 

operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; 

regulatory or labor conditions applicable to us, our industry or the industries we serve; 

market conditions in our industry, the industries we serve, the financial markets and the economy as a whole; 

changes in our capital structure; 

our ability to remain current in our SEC filings; 

our ability to remediate our material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting; and 

sales of our common stock by us or members of our management team. 

In addition, the stock market historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. 
 Volatility in the market price of our common stock may make it difficult for you to resell shares of our common stock when you want or at attractive prices. In addition, when the market price of a company s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the Company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs or awards for legal damages, and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources. 
 Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make a contested takeover more difficult. 
 Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware DGCL could deter a change in our management or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of us, even if such a proposal is favored by a majority of our stockholders. For example, we are subject to the provisions of the DGCL that prohibit a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15 or more of such corporation s outstanding voting shares (an interested stockholder for three years after the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Our certificate of incorporation provides that directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of 75 of our outstanding shares and that amendments to our bylaws require the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares. Our certificate of incorporation also includes undesignated preferred stock, which may enable our board of directors to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or otherwise. Finally, our bylaws include an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate directors or submit proposals at a stockholders meeting. 
 Our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a large portion of our common stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control. 
 Under applicable SEC rules, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bohn H. Crain, beneficially owns approximately 20 of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, Mr. Crain can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Further, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders.

 Trading in our common stock has been limited. 
 Although our common stock is traded on the NYSE American, it is traded not as frequently as compared to the volume of trading activity associated with larger companies whose shares trade on the larger national exchanges. Because of this limited liquidity, stockholders may be unable to sell their shares at the prices or volumes they desire. The trading price of our shares may from time to time fluctuate widely. The trading price may be affected by a number of factors including events described in the risk factors set forth in this report as well as our operating results, financial condition, announcements, general conditions in the industry and the financial markets, and other events or factors. In recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and smaller capitalization companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. In a volatile market, we may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. 
 The influx of additional shares of our common stock onto the market may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. 
 We have completed many acquisitions that often include the issuance of additional shares pursuant to the purchase agreements. In addition, we may issue additional shares in connection with such acquisitions upon the achievement of certain earn-out thresholds or in connection with future acquisitions as part of the purchase consideration. The availability of additional shares for sale to the public under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and sale of such shares in public markets could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such an adverse effect on the market price would make it more difficult for us to sell our equity securities in the future at prices we deem appropriate or to use our shares as currency for future acquisitions, which will make it more difficult to execute our acquisition strategy. 
 The issuance of additional shares may result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. 
 At any time, we may make private offerings of our securities. We have issued, and may be required to issue, additional shares of common stock or common stock equivalents in payment of the purchase price of businesses we have acquired. This will have the effect of further increasing the number of shares outstanding. In connection with future acquisitions, we may undertake the issuance of more shares of common stock without notice to our then existing stockholders. We may also issue additional shares in order to, among other things, compensate employees or consultants or for other valid business reasons in the discretion of our board of directors, which could result in diluting the interests of our existing stockholders. 
 The exercise or conversion of our outstanding options, or other convertible securities or any derivative securities we issue in the future will result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. We are currently authorized to issue 100 million shares of common stock. As of September 5, 2023, we had 47,292,971 outstanding shares of common stock. As of September 5, 2023, we may in the future issue up to 2,306,838 additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. 
 We may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock. 
 Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms for those shares without the approval of our stockholders. Any such preferred stock we may issue in the future could rank ahead of our common stock in many ways, including in terms of dividends, liquidation rights, and voting rights. 
 As we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, investors in our shares of common stock will not receive any dividend income. 
 We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any dividends that we may pay in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on our future earnings, any applicable regulatory considerations, our financial requirements and other similarly unpredictable factors. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the terms of our credit facilities. Accordingly, investors seeking dividend income should not purchase our common stock. 
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 The trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our business or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

 I TEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report. 
 Overview 
 We operate as a third-party logistics company, providing technology-enabled global transportation and value-added logistics solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. We service a large and diversified account base consisting of consumer goods, food and beverage, electronics and high-tech, aviation and automotive, military and government, and manufacturing and retail customers, which is supported from an extensive network of operating locations across North America as well as an integrated international service partner network located in other key markets around the globe. The Company provides these services through a multi-brand network, which includes over 100 operating locations. Included in these operating locations are a number of independent agents, who are also referred to as strategic operating partners, that operate exclusively on the Company's behalf, and approximately 25 Company-owned offices. As a third-party logistics company, the Company has a vast carrier network of asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in its carrier network. We believe shippers value our services because we are able to objectively arrange the most efficient and cost-effective means, type and provider of transportation service without undue influence caused by the ownership of transportation assets. In addition, our minimal investment in physical assets affords us the opportunity for a higher return on invested capital and net cash flows than our asset-based competitors. 
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic, international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services, including truckload services, LTL services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. Our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS. Our services include arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added logistics services, including MM D, CHB and GTM solutions to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 The Company expects to grow its business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. The Company s organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships leveraging the benefit of the Company s truck brokerage and intermodal service offerings, while continuing its efforts on the organic build-out of the Company s network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, as the Company continues to grow and scale its business, the Company believes that it is creating density in its trade lanes, which creates opportunities for the Company to more efficiently source and manage its transportation capacity. 
 In addition to its focus on organic growth, the Company will continue to search for acquisition candidates that bring critical mass from a geographic and purchasing power standpoint, along with providing complementary service offerings to the current platform. As the Company continues to grow and scale its business, it also remains focused on leveraging its back-office infrastructure and technology systems to drive productivity improvement across the organization. 
 Impact of Notable External Conditions 
 The global economic and trade environments remain uncertain, including the potential future impacts of a pandemic, higher inflation and oil prices, rising interest rates and the conflict in Ukraine, and could have a negative impact on our business and financial results. As demand softens and pandemic restrictions subsided, port congestion cleared, shortages of labor and equipment eased resulting in excess carrier capacity over demand. These conditions could impact our financial results. 
 Performance Metrics 
 Our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding and freight brokerage services we provide to our customers. As a third-party logistics provider, we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination. Generally, we quote our customers a turnkey cost for the movement of their freight. Our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time-definite needs (first day through fifth day delivery), special handling needs (heavy equipment, delicate items, environmentally sensitive goods, electronic components, etc.), and the means of transport (motor carrier, air, ocean or rail). In turn, we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Our transportation revenue represents the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers. Our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation, including motor carrier, air, ocean, and rail services. Our adjusted transportation gross profit (gross transportation revenue less the direct cost of transportation), a non-GAAP financial measure, is the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value and resell services provided by third-parties, and is considered by management to be a key performance measure. In addition, management believes measuring its operating costs as a function of adjusted transportation gross profit provides a useful metric, as our ability to control costs as a function of adjusted transportation gross profit directly impacts operating results. 
 Our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur. Since acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, our financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition. 
 Adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, is our revenue minus our cost of transportation and other services (excluding depreciation and amortization, which are reported separately), and adjusted gross profit percentage is adjusted gross profit as a percentage of our total revenue. We believe that these provide investors with meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. 
 Our GAAP-based net income will be affected by non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets attributable to completed acquisitions. Under applicable accounting standards, purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration in a business combination to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition. The excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is to be allocated to goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment. Applicable accounting standards require that we separately account for and value certain identifiable intangible assets based on the unique facts and circumstances of each acquisition. As a result of our acquisition strategy, our net income will include material non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Although these charges may increase as we complete more acquisitions, we believe we will be growing the value of our intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships). Thus, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric for our business. 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of income and does not include the effects of interest, taxes, and the non-cash effects of depreciation and amortization on long-term assets. Companies have some discretion as to which elements of depreciation and amortization are excluded in the EBITDA calculation. We exclude all depreciation charges related to property, technology, and equipment and all amortization charges (including amortization of leasehold improvements). We then further adjust EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions, ransomware incident related costs, changes in fair value of interest rate swap contracts, restatement costs, transition and lease termination costs, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, extraordinary items, litigation expenses unrelated to our core operations, and other non-cash charges. While management considers EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace any presentation included in our consolidated financial statements. The Company s financial covenants with its lenders define an adjusted EBITDA as a key component of its covenant calculations. The Company s ability to grow adjusted EBITDA is closely monitored by management as it s directly tied to financial borrowing capacity and also is a frequent point of discussion with its investors as well as the Company s earnings calls. 
 Our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The impact of seasonality on our business will depend on numerous factors, including the markets in which we operate, holiday seasons, consumer demand, and economic conditions. Since our revenue is largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just-in-time production schedules, the timing of our revenue is often beyond our control. Factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production delays could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenue. As we increase the scale of our operations, seasonal trends in one area of our business may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area. We cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors, nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor, and thus we can give no assurance any historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Accounting policies, methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments. These judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience regarding past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments. While there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates that affect our financial statements, the areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition; the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets; and fair value of contingent consideration.

 Table of Contents 
 
 As a non-asset-based carrier, we do not generally own transportation assets. We do, however, own certain trailers and refrigerated trailers that we use in our business. We generate the majority of our transportation revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct (asset-based) carriers and reselling those services to our customers. We recognize revenue and the corresponding related costs in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Our performance obligation is satisfied over time and recognized upon the transfer of control of the services over the requisite transit period as customers goods move from point of origin to point of destination. We determine the period to recognize revenue and the corresponding related costs based upon the actual departure date and delivery date, if available, or estimated delivery date if delivery has not occurred as of the reporting date. Certain shipments may require us to estimate revenue, in which case it uses the average revenue per shipment, per mode of transportation. Determination of the transit period and the percentage of completion of the shipment as of the reporting date requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition. Macroeconomic conditions impacting the supply chain such as port delays, COVID-19 impacting the labor force, as well as inflationary pressures can impact the actual results compared to our estimates. Revenue from CHB services is recognized upon completion of the service. 
 We perform an annual impairment test for goodwill as of April 1 of each year or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if further testing is necessary, we would determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount. 
 Definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer related intangible assets, trade names and trademarks, licenses, developed technology, and non-compete agreements arising from the Company s acquisitions and are amortized using the straight-line method over periods of up to 15 years. 
 We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a long-lived asset is less than its carrying amount, the asset is considered to be impaired. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, we estimate fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
 The Company has contingent obligations to transfer cash payments and/or equity shares to former shareholders of acquired operations in conjunction with certain acquisitions if specified operating results and financial objectives are met over their stated earn-out period. The Company uses projected future financial results based on recent and historical data to value the anticipated future earn-out payments. To calculate fair value, the future earn-out payments were then discounted using Level 3 inputs.

 Transportation revenue was 1,032.9 million and 1,416.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of 383.2 million, or 27.1 , is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in international and ocean rates, including significantly lower ocean volumes, and a lack of non-recurring charter business which had occurred in the prior year. Adjusted transportation gross profit was 254.2 million and 282.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted transportation gross profit percentage increased from 20.0 to 24.6 , primarily due to a higher mix of domestic shipments, which have higher gross profit margin characteristics than ocean shipments . 
 Value-added services revenue was 52.6 million and 43.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of 9.2 million, or 21.3 , is primarily attributable to the increase in warehouse revenues from our Canada segment. Adjusted value-added services gross profit was 29.6 million and 23.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted value-added services gross profit percentage increased from 54.2 to 56.3 .

Operating partner commissions decreased 6.3 million, or 5.2 , to 115.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the decreased adjusted gross profit from operating partners, a reduction in the number of strategic operating partners, and the conversion of a strategic operating partner to a Company-owned location not subject to commission . As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, operating partner commissions increased 92 basis points to 40.7 from 39.8 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as a result of a higher percentage of adjusted gross profit coming from operating partner locations. 
 Personnel costs increased 7.3 million, or 10.1 , to 79.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a full year of operations associated with the acquisition of Navegate and increased workforce supporting the expansion of business in Canada. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, personnel costs increased 443 basis points to 28.0 from 23.6 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 4.5 million, or 13.3 , to 38.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a full year of operations associated with the acquisition of Navegate, increased facility expenses, IT related initiatives, and increased professional service fees as a result of our restatement, offset by decreased bad debt costs. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, SG A increased 247 basis points to 13.6 from 11.1 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization costs increased 4.0 million, or 21.3 , to 22.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The increase is attributable to the acquisition of Navegate and the accelerated amortization of trade names resulting from the rebranding of certain trade names. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, depreciation and amortization increased 189 basis points to 8.0 from 6.1 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration was a gain of 0.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to a loss of 0.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The change in each fiscal year is attributable to a change in management s estimates of future earn-out payments through the remainder of the respective earn-out periods. 
 Net other expense increased 0.2 million, or 30.7 , from an expense of 0.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 to an expense of 0.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. 
 Our change in net income is driven by decreased adjusted gross profit, increased operating expenses, and decreased income taxes compared to the prior fiscal year. 
 Our future financial results may be impacted by amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions as well as gains or losses from changes in fair value of contingent consideration that are difficult to predict.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Generally, our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, as described below. These sources also fund a portion of our capital expenditures and contractual contingent consideration obligations. Our level of cash and financing capabilities along with cash flows from operations have historically been sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs. As of June 30, 2023, we have 32.5 million in unrestricted cash on hand to serve as adequate working capital. 
 Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 97.9 million and 24.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash provided primarily consisted of net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable, income taxes, and accrued expenses and other liabilities. 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 10.7 million and 45.7 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash paid for acquisitions were 3.3 million and 38.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash paid for purchases of property, technology, and equipment were 7.6 million and 7.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Net cash used for financing activities was 80.2 million and net cash provided by financing activities was 28.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net repayments of the Revolving Credit Facility were 62.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to net proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility of 47.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Payments of debt issuance costs were 0.9 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Repayments of notes payable and finance lease liabilities were 5.0 million and 5.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Proceeds from the sale of common stock were 0.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Payments for repurchases of common stock were 11.1 million and 11.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Distributions to non-controlling interest were 0.6 million and 1.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Proceeds from exercises of stock options were 0.3 million and 0.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Payments of employee tax withholdings related to restricted stock units and stock options were 0.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 Working Capital 
 We believe that our current working capital, anticipated cash flow from operations, and access to financing through the Revolving Credit Facility are adequate for funding existing operations for the next twelve months. 
 Acquisitions 
 Below are descriptions of recent acquisitions in the last two fiscal years. 
 On December 3, 2021, and effective as of November 30, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Navegate, Inc. Navegate ), a Minnesota based, privately held company from Saltspring Capital, LLC. Navegate is a technology-enabled supply chain management and third-party logistics services company that combines a robust digital platform and decades of expertise to manage international, cross-border, and domestic freight from purchase order to final delivery. Navegate s combination of technology-enabled services, customs brokerage expertise, and a full complement of international and domestic services significantly reduces costs and leads to better compliance and risk mitigation for its customers. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid 38.9 million in cash. 
 On October 1, 2022, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the assets and operations of Cascade Enterprises of Minnesota, Inc. Cascade a Minneapolis, Minnesota based privately held company that has operated as a strategic operating partner under the Company s Airgroup brand since 2007. As part of the post-acquisition integration activities, Cascade has combined with existing Company owned operations in Minneapolis and is able to leverage the Company s Global Trade Management GTM platform to strengthen the Company s purchase order and vendor management service offerings. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid 3.3 million in cash upon closing, and the seller is entitled to additional contingent consideration payable in subsequent periods based on future performance of the acquired operation. 
 Technology 
 A primary component of our business strategy is to provide robust and advanced technology offerings to our customers, while providing advanced technology to our operations, strategic operating partners and management. To accomplish this, we will continuously develop and enhance our technology platform to align with current and future business requirements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we capitalized approximately 0.6 million on technology enhancements and software systems in order to increase our operating efficiency and improve technology offerings. We expect to spend between 2.0 million and 3.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 in order to continue enhancing our technology platform, which we expect will include elements focused on customer facing, vendor facing, and user facing tools and systems that will be integrated into our existing platform and support our continued growth. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company entered into a 200 million syndicated, revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a 75 million accordion feature to support future acquisition opportunities. The Revolving Credit Facility was entered into with Bank of America, N.A. and BMO Capital Markets Corp. as joint book runners and joint lead arrangers, Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of Montreal as syndication agent, KeyBank National Association and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. as co-documentation agents and Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, KeyBank National Association, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and Washington Federal Bank, National Association as lenders (such named lenders are collectively referred to herein as Lenders ).

 Table of Contents 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and is collateralized by a first-priority security interest in the accounts receivable and other assets of the Company its guarantors named below on a parity basis with the security interest held by Fiera Private Debt Fund IV LP and Fiera Private Debt Fund V LP described below. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest (at the Company s option), at a) the Lenders base rate plus 0.75 and can be subsequently adjusted based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio under the facility at the Lenders base rate plus 0.50 to 1.50 ; b) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 1.65 and can be subsequently adjusted based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio under the facility at Term SOFR plus 1.40 to 2.40 ; and c) Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate plus 1.65 and can be subsequently adjusted based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio under the facility at Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate plus 1.40 to 2.40 .

 For borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.00 and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00. Additional minimum availability requirements and financial covenants apply in the event the Company seeks to use advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to pursue acquisitions or repurchase its common stock. 
 As of June 30, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Senior Secured Loan 
 In connection with the Company s acquisition of Radiant Canada, Radiant Canada obtained a CAD 29 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund IV LP FPD IV formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund IV LP) pursuant to a CAD 29,000,000 Credit Facilities Loan Agreement. The Company s U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries are guarantors of the obligations thereunder. The loan matures on April 1, 2024 and accrues interest at a rate of 6.65 per annum. The Company is required to maintain five months interest in a debt service reserve account to be controlled by FPD IV. 
 In connection with the Company s acquisition of Lomas, Radiant Canada obtained a CAD 10 million senior secured Canadian term loan from Fiera Private Debt Fund V LP (formerly, Integrated Private Debt Fund V LP) pursuant to a CAD 10,000,000 Credit Facilities Loan Agreement. The Company s U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries are guarantors of the obligations thereunder. The loan matures on June 1, 2024 and accrues interest at a fixed rate of 6.65 per annum.

 For additional information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of June 30, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which had been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 
 Recent Accounting Guidance 
 The recent accounting guidance is discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report. 
 ESG and Climate Change Effects 
 ESG matters continue to attract considerable public and scientific attention. 
 At Radiant, we recognize the importance of addressing climate-related risks and opportunities to ensure our business is resilient and sustainable for the future. In 2023, we have taken strides to align with the TCFD framework. We have already begun to collect data to inform future strategy as well as our disclosures. 
 To test the resilience of our strategy, we will develop scenario analysis to stress test and improve our resiliency. As part of this effort, we plan to host workshops with leaders across the company to identify and discuss our climate-related risks and opportunities. Climate-related risks identified through this scenario analysis exercise will be incorporated into Radiant s Enterprise Risk Management ERM Framework. 
 34 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 Due to Radiant s asset-light based business model and strategy, we do not anticipate that the risks associated with climate change will have a material financial impact on our business in the short, medium, or long term. In particular, Radiant is not exposed to rising emissions costs through carbon taxes as its revenue model historically adds a service fee to the cost of shipping. Nor will Radiant, as an asset-light freight forwarder, face the rising investment costs and risks that carriers will bear to decarbonize their vessels, aircraft and vehicles. 
 Throughout our ESG assessment process, however, we have identified potential climate-related revenue opportunities that we are seeking to capture. These include helping customers to manage increased complexity from carbon taxes and emissions reporting requirements; meeting the demand for decarbonized logistics services including intermodal and other eco-friendly transportation and logistics solutions; and supporting government agencies, non-governmental organizations NGOs and other partners. 
 We include below our preliminary TCFD disclosures based on our business model and assessment of materiality. Following the completion of our carbon inventory, we will subsequently publish a full TCFD report, which will be available online at www.radiantdelivers.com . 
 As Radiant continues our ESG journey, we have begun to map and link a range of environmental, social, and governance topics to the relevant voluntary disclosure frameworks, beginning with the TCFD framework. By evaluating our non-asset-based business model against this voluntary framework, we are seeking to best align and progress in the area of climate, while also evaluating avenues for improvement in the areas of social initiatives and governance. 

Category Governance: 
 Disclose the organization s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities 

Describe the Board s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 Risk management is a strategic priority within the Company and responsibility for managing risk rests with management while the Committees and the Board provide oversight. Radiant is committed to our responsibility to sustainability and climate-related matters and has undertaken to integrate this core value into our corporate governance. As part of this process, the Board of Directors has made ESG risks and opportunities a regular agenda item in quarterly meetings. An independent board member has been responsible for sustainability/ESG and has been spearheading this discussion since 2022. 

Describe management s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 With the independent board member providing oversight, the Radiant ESG Steering Committee has been meeting weekly since 2022 to establish learning pathways for the organization as a whole, data collection processes and metrics, as well as a cadence of risk and opportunity assessment that engages with all leaders of senior management. The ESG Steering Committee is headed by our Vice President of Marketing Communications, who serves as the management liaison and updates the CEO and Board of Directors on all ESG-related activities. Radiant has further engaged the expertise of key members within the organization with the preliminary development of an Radiant ESG Task Force, which meets monthly to ensure our climate-related initiatives continue to align seamlessly with our business strategy and overarching corporate goals. 

Category Strategy: 
 Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization s businesses, strategy and financial planning 

Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. 
 Radiant began its initial assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities in 2022 and has continued to evaluate these throughout 2023. This process will continue as we identify and formalize those short, medium, and long term risks and opportunities, with the understanding that this is a changing model that must account for a dynamic market. We believe our operations model is uniquely positioned to be both flexible and agile in making both these assessments and adjustments. We will continue to engage with our customers and vendors to ensure we are aware of developments in climate-related risks and opportunities and other sustainability measures. In doing so, we will look to manage policy change, technology updates, and market shifts, in addition to the physical risks of climate-related events or the fallout from such an event, as well as the ongoing reputational risks associated with the transportation industry.

We will also continue to develop relationships with vendors and partners who share the core value that we are all responsible for climate-related challenges. As such, we will continue to align with partners who likewise seek to develop robust environmental initiatives within their own organization. We see our core commitment to our customers as a climate-related, emerging opportunity on multiple fronts: helping customers to manage increased complexity from carbon taxes and emissions reporting requirements; meeting the shifting demand for decarbonized logistics services including intermodal and other eco-friendly transportation and logistics solutions; and supporting government agencies, NGOs and other partners. 

Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization s businesses, strategy, and financial planning. 
 We do not anticipate risks associated with climate change to be material, due to Radiant s asset-light based business model. However, we have flexibility that will enable us to adjust and respond accordingly where and when appropriate. Radiant also seeks to capture increased opportunities by further developing services that simplify the supply chains of our customers, support best practices in terms of partnerships with like-minded organizations, and enhance learning opportunities via climate-conscious industry groups and associations. 

Describe the resilience of the organization s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 C or lower scenario. 
 Radiant is developing its ERM Framework to include the identification, assessment and response to climate-related events. We will be developing scenario analysis to stress test and improve our resiliency.

 Climate-related risks are reviewed and discussed initially via our ESG Steering Committee and moving forward in conjunction with our ESG Task Force. While discussed at the committee level, these risks will still be considered in conjunction with our ERM Framework at the Board level and with our overall Business Continuity Plan in mind. 

Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization s overall risk management. 
 Regarding day-to-day continuity, the Radiant ESG Steering Committee will have oversight for data acquisition, measurement and evaluation. The Radiant ESG Task Force will begin to monitor and discuss industry developments and change in climate-related areas, to ensure we have the most up to date information and developments at the field level. Finally and as regards to overall risk in climate-related areas, the ESG Steering Committee will continue to report on at least a quarterly basis to both the CEO and the Board of Directors in these areas.

Describe the organization s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions, and the related risks. 
 While Radiant is an asset-light structure, we recognize the impact that offices, warehouses and certain business lines contribute to the overall global carbon footprint (Scope 1 2 emissions). Likewise, we believe we have the responsibility to make positive choices in our own service providers who ultimately contribute to our own footprint (Scope 3 emissions). In 2023, we began the data collection process for our own Company-owned locations, the end result of which will encompass our Scope 1 2 emissions. We will subsequently turn to our Scope 3 emissions to ultimately build a complete picture of our greenhouse gas emissions, whilst making meaningful reduction targets for our emissions throughout.

In the meantime, we have long been committed to sustainability programs. Many of these are well established across our organization and include: Technology Recycling Program; 

 Public Transport Incentive Program for corporate employees; 

 Power-Saving Automatic lights roll-out to reduce electricity consumption; 

 Reduce, Re-use: water bottle filling stations to encourage multi-use containers, as well as the roll-out of compostable cutlery and plates at Company-owned locations, where available; 

 Recycle: paper recycling program at our corporate headquarter; and 

 Remote hybrid working options to reduce emissions from commuting. 

Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. 
 While we are focusing on the data collection to quantify your Scope 1 2 greenhouse gas emissions, we will continue to evaluate programs that will help to reduce our overall impact as a company on the environment. Once we have concluded our baseline measurements, we intend to establish formal targets to measure our performance against. 

I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as well as intercompany transactions. Significant changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies in which we transact business and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have not entered into any hedging activities, and, to the extent that we continue not to do so in the future, we may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. A portion of our business is conducted in Canada. If foreign exchange rates were 1.0 higher or lower, our net income would have changed by approximately 0.14 million. 
 We are also subject to risks related to an increase in interest rates. For every 1.0 million outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility, we will incur approximately 0.05 million of interest expense. For every 1.0 increase in interest rates, our interest expense per 1.0 million in borrowings will increase by approximately 0.01 million.

 Radiant Logistics, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Radiant Logistics, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment in Item 9A: 
 The Company does not have effective internal controls over the recording and processing of revenues. Specifically, the controls as currently designed are not sufficient to prevent or detect a material misstatement in revenues as the design of the controls lacks the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenues. 
 39 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 The Company does not have effective internal controls over the design and operation of information technology general controls, specifically relating to change management and user access rights which impacted the Company s Transportation Management systems as well as its Enterprise Resource Planning system. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on effective IT systems, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, are also deemed ineffective. 
 We considered the material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and our opinion on such consolidated financial statements was not affected. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Period End Revenue Recognition 
 As of June 30, 2023, the Company s contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable were 6.2 million and 22.5 million, respectively. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, contract assets represent estimated amounts for which the Company has the right to consideration for transportation services related to the completed portion of in-transit shipments at period end, but for which it has not yet completed the performance obligations. Upon completion of the performance obligations, which can vary in duration based upon the mode of transportation, the balance is included in accounts receivable. 
 The Company s transportation transactions provide for the arrangement of the movement of freight to a customer s destination. The Company recognizes revenue for the performance obligation that is satisfied over time upon the transfer of control of the services over the requisite transit period as the customer s goods move from point of origin to point of destination. Recognizing revenue at period end for customer shipments and their related costs requires management to make significant judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized, including the estimation of recent average historic in-transit times by mode, historic average revenue by weight by mode, or by shipment by mode, if weight is not used, and percentage of completion of shipments in transit. Macroeconomic conditions impacting the supply chain can impact the actual results compared to the Company s estimates.

 Table of Contents 
 
 We identified the auditing of contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable related to period end revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. Auditing the estimate of the amount of revenue recognized at period end for partially completed and completed shipments involved significant audit effort, as well as especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. The following are the most relevant procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter: 
 Evaluating the Company s process used in developing the estimate for the amount of revenue recognized at the period end by: 

o Evaluating the methodology used by management. 

o Testing the accuracy and completeness of the data utilized by management. 

o Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used for recent average historic in-transit times by mode and average revenue by weight or shipment, as appropriate. 

o Testing the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations. 

Consolidated Financial Statements Impact of Material Weaknesses 
 As discussed in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, the Company identified material weaknesses in their internal control over financial reporting related to the ineffective design and operation of ITGCs over the information technology IT systems supporting the Company s Transportation Management TM systems as well as its Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on effective IT systems, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, are also deemed ineffective. The material weaknesses in their internal control over financial reporting is associated with (i) not designing and maintaining effective ITGCs over privileged user accounts and developers for its TM systems used to account for revenue and related cost of transportation and its ERP system used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and (ii) not designing and maintaining effective controls to timely detect and independently review instances where individuals with access to create and implement systems changes to the TM and ERP systems. 
 The material weaknesses impacted the Company s business process controls that rely on information produced by the systems and reports which affect substantially all financial statement account balances and disclosures; and result is a critical audit matter that required us to increase the extent of our audit effort, including the need to modify the nature and extent of audit procedures performed as well as audit evidence obtained. 
 Addressing the matters involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, evaluating the nature and extent of audit procedures performed and evidence obtained. We increased the number of selections we would have otherwise made if the Company s controls were designed and operating effectively. In addition, we utilized original source documents for audit evidence, rather than system reports or other information generated by systems affected by the material weaknesses identified.

 operating locations. Included in these operating locations are a number of independent agents, who are also referred to as strategic operating partners, that operate exclusively on the Company's behalf, and approximately Company-owned offices. As a third-party logistics company, the Company has a vast carrier network of asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in its carrier network. Through its operating locations across North America, the Company offers domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services, including truckload services, less than truckload services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. The Company s primary transportation services involve arranging shipments, on behalf of its customers, of materials, products, equipment, and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. The Company also provides other value-added logistics services including materials management and distribution services (collectively, materials management and distribution or MM D services), and customs house brokerage CHB services to complement its core transportation service offering. 

 owned by Radiant Capital Partners, LLC RCP, see Note 11), an entity owned by the Company s Chief Executive Officer. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets represents RCP s proportionate share of equity in RLP. Net income (loss) of non-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries or variable interest entities is allocated to the Company and the holder(s) of the non-controlling interest in proportion to their percentage ownership interests. 

of interest payments on the Company s senior secured loan held by the lender that are required to be set aside. Restricted cash of is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, and is included in deposits and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 . The Company combines unrestricted and restricted cash for presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 and , respectively (see Note 2s). The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue through independently owned strategic operating partner locations operating under various Company brands. Each strategic operating partner is responsible for some or all of the collection of the accounts related to the underlying customers being serviced by such strategic operating partner. To facilitate this arrangement, based on contractual agreements, certain strategic operating partners are required to maintain a bad debt reserve in the form of a security deposit with the Company. The Company charges each strategic operating partner s bad debt reserve account for any accounts receivable aged beyond 90 days along with any other amounts owed to the Company by strategic operating partners. However, the bad debt reserve account may carry a deficit balance when amounts charged to this reserve account exceed amounts otherwise available. In these circumstances, a deficit bad debt reserve account is recognized as a receivable in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Some strategic operating partners are not required to establish a bad debt reserve; however, they are still responsible to make up for any deficits and the Company may withhold all or a portion of future commissions payable to the strategic operating partner to satisfy any deficit balance. The Company expects to replenish these funds through the future business operations of these strategic operating partners or as their customers satisfy the amounts payable to the Company. However, to the extent any of these strategic operating partners were to cease operations or otherwise be unable to replenish these deficit accounts, the Company would be at risk of loss for any such amounts and generally would reserve for them. 
 
 reporting units for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test. An entity has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount prior to performing a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment evaluates various factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, recent events, and financial trends that may impact the fair value of the reporting unit. If it is determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, a quantitative assessment is required. Otherwise, no further analysis is required. If a quantitative assessment is performed, a reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying amount. A reporting unit s fair value is determined based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including the income approach, which utilizes projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved, and multiples of current and future earnings, and market approach, which utilizes a selection of guideline public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1 of each year or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022 , management believes no impairment exists.

 In general, each shipment transaction or service order constitutes a separate contract with the customer. A performance obligation is created once a customer agreement with an agreed upon transaction price exists. The transaction price is typically fixed and not contingent upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any other event. The transaction price is generally due 30 to 45 days from the date of invoice. The Company s transportation transactions provide for the arrangement of the movement of freight to a customer s agreed upon destination. The transportation services, including certain ancillary services, such as loading/unloading, freight insurance and customs clearance, that are provided to the customer represent a single performance obligation as the ancillary services are not distinct in the context of the contract and therefore combined with the performance obligation for transportation services. This performance obligation is satisfied over time and recognized in revenue upon the transfer of control of the services over the requisite transit period as the customer s goods move from point of origin to point of destination. The Company determines the period to recognize revenue based upon the actual departure date and delivery date, if available, or estimated delivery date if delivery has not occurred as of the reporting date. Certain shipments may require the Company to estimate revenue, in which case it uses the average revenue per shipment, per mode of transportation. Determination of the estimated revenue, transit period and the percentage of completion of the shipment as of the reporting date requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition. The Company has determined that revenue recognition over the transit period provides a reasonable estimate of the transfer of services to its customers as it depicts the pattern of the Company s performance under the contracts with its customers. The timing of revenue recognition, billings, cash collections, and allowance for doubtful accounts results in billed and unbilled receivables. The Company receives the unconditional right to bill when shipments are delivered to their destination. The Company has elected to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the period as the Company s contract with its transportation customers have an expected duration of one year or less. The corresponding direct costs of revenue, including primarily purchased transportation costs and commissions, have been expensed ratably as incurred. The Company also provides MM D services for its customers under contracts generally ranging from a few months to five years and include renewal provisions. These MM D service contracts provide for inventory management, order fulfillment and warehousing of the customer s product and arrangement of transportation of the customer s product. The Company s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the services provided by the Company as it performs. Revenue is recognized in the amount for which the Company has the right to invoice the customer, as this amount corresponds directly with the value provided to the customer for the Company s performance completed to date. The transaction price is based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the fixed consideration component of a contract represents reimbursement for facility and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration component is comprised of cost reimbursement per unit pricing for time and pricing for materials used and is determined based on cost plus a mark-up for hours of services provided and materials used and is recognized over time based on the level of activity volume. Other services include primarily CHB services sold separately as a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from this performance obligation at a point in time, which is the completion of the services. Duties and taxes collected from the customer and paid to the customs agent on behalf of the customers are excluded from revenue. The Company uses independent contractors and third-party carriers in the performance of its transportation services. The Company evaluates who controls the transportation services to determine whether its performance obligation is to transfer services to the customer or to arrange for services to be provided by another party. The Company determined it acts as the principal for its transportation services performance obligation since it is in control of establishing the prices for the specified services, managing all aspects of the shipments process and assuming the risk of loss for delivery and collection. Such transportation services revenue is presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Contract Assets Contract assets represent estimated amounts for which the Company has the right to consideration for transportation services related to the completed portion of in-transit shipments at period end, but for which it has not yet completed the performance obligations. Upon completion of the performance obligations, which can vary in duration based upon the mode of transportation, the balance is included in accounts receivable. Operating Partner and Other Commissions The Company enters into contractual arrangements with strategic operating partners that operate, on behalf of the Company, an office in a specific location that engages primarily in arranging, domestic and international, transportation services. In return, the strategic operating partner is compensated through the payment of sales commissions, which are based on individual shipments. The Company accrues the strategic operating partners commission obligation ratably as the goods are transferred to the customer. The Company records employee sales commissions related to transportation services as an expense when incurred since the amortization period of such costs is less than one year.

 period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation expense is reflected in personnel costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which the Company has generally not included in its calculation of ROU assets or lease liabilities as it is not reasonably certain that the option will be exercised in the normal course of business. For the Company s lease agreements containing fixed payments for both lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for the components as a single lease component, as permitted. For leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the exemption from recording ROU assets and lease liabilities for all leases that qualify, and records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Expenses for these short-term leases for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are immaterial. Certain leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. Variable payments, to the extent they are not considered fixed, are expensed as incurred. Variable lease costs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are immaterial. For finance leases, interest expense on the lease liability is recognized using the effective interest method and amortization of the ROU asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Amortization expense amounted to and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Certain acquired trade names have been rebranded in connection with the Company s long-term growth strategy for consistency across the business and to better serve its customers. The Company will gradually phase out certain trade names and will predominantly use Radiant to refer to the Company. The rebranding resulted in the reduction of the related useful lives of certain trade names and accelerated amortization expense from June 2022 to December 2022.

 by RGL and by RCP, a company for which the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is the sole member. RLP is a certified minority business enterprise that was formed for the purpose of providing the Company with a national accounts strategy to pursue corporate and government accounts with diversity initiatives. RCP s ownership interest entitles it to of the profits and distributable cash, if any, generated by RLP. The operations of RLP are intended to provide certain benefits to the Company, including expanding the scope of services offered by the Company and participating in supplier diversity programs not otherwise available to the Company. In the course of evaluating and approving the ownership structure, operations and economics emanating from RLP, a committee consisting of the independent Board members of the Company, considered, among other factors, the significant benefits provided to the Company through association with a minority business enterprise, particularly as many of the Company s largest current and potential customers have a need for diversity offerings. In addition, the committee concluded that the economic relationship with RLP was on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms generally available from unaffiliated third-parties. Certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties are considered variable interest entities. The Company has power over significant activities of RLP including the fulfillment of its contracts and financing its operations. Additionally, the Company also pays expenses and collects receivables on behalf of RLP. Thus, the Company is the primary beneficiary, RLP qualifies as a variable interest entity, and RLP is consolidated in these consolidated financial statements. RLP recorded and in net income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. RCP s distributable share was and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The non-controlling interest recorded as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income represents RCP s distributive share.

The Company has contingent obligations to transfer cash payments and equity shares to former shareholders of acquired operations in conjunction with certain acquisitions if specified operating results and financial objectives are met over their stated earn-out period. Contingent consideration is measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent liability is included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change in fair value in each period is principally attributable to a change in management s estimates of future earn-out payments through the remainder of the earn-out periods. The Company uses projected future financial results based on recent and historical data to value the anticipated future earn-out payments. To calculate fair value, the future earn-out payments were then discounted using Level 3 inputs. The Company has classified the contingent consideration as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs. The Company believes the discount rate used to discount the earn-out payments reflects market participant assumptions. Changes in assumptions and operating results could have a significant impact on the earn-out amount, through earn-out periods measured through September 2024, although there are no maximums on certain earn-out payments.)

As discussed in Note 9, derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair market value of interest rate swaps are determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs, specifically a pricing service proprietary to Bank of America. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Company s cash equivalents, receivables, contract assets, accounts payable, commissions payable, accrued expenses, and the income tax receivable and payable approximate the fair values due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and notes payable would not differ significantly from fair value (based on Level 2 inputs) if recalculated based on current interest rates. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , there were transfers of financial instruments between Level 1, 2, and 3.

In response, the former customer has claimed damages against the Company for alleged breach of contract and damages. The matter is in its preliminary stage and the Company is not yet able to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of loss, if any. The Company intends to defend against these claims. An adverse outcome could have a material impact on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. On December 8, 2021, the Company detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of the Company s operational and information technology systems. While the Company s systems recovery efforts are complete and the Company s operations are fully functional, the incident did result in a loss of revenue as well as certain incremental costs.

, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired the assets and operations of Cascade Enterprises of Minnesota, Inc. Cascade a Minneapolis, Minnesota based privately held company that has operated as a strategic operating partner under the Company s Airgroup brand since 2007. As part of the post-acquisition integration activities, Cascade has combined with existing Company owned operations in Minneapolis and is able to leverage the Company s Global Trade Management GTM platform to strengthen the Company s purchase order and vendor management service offerings. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid in cash upon closing, and the seller is entitled to additional contingent consideration payable in subsequent periods based on future performance of the acquired operation.

The fair values of the intangible assets were estimated by the Company with the assistance of valuation specialists. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach with Level 3 inputs. Under this method, an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To calculate fair value, the Company used risk-adjusted cash flows discounted at rates considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each type of asset. The Company believes the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions. The goodwill is recorded in the U.S. operating segment and is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes over a period of years. Intangible assets acquired consist of customer related intangible assets and have a useful life of years. After management s review of post-acquisition integration activities, it was determined that the leased facility had no future economic benefit to the Company and abandoned the lease. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 , a lease abandonment charge of was recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The results of operations from Cascade were included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. However, they were immaterial and thus no proforma presentation was necessary. Fiscal Year 2022 Acquisition On December 3, 2021, and effective as of November 30, 2021, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Navegate, Inc. Navegate ), a Minnesota based, privately held company from Saltspring Capital, LLC. Navegate is a technology-enabled supply chain management and third-party logistics services company that combines a robust digital platform and decades of expertise to manage international, cross-border, and domestic freight from purchase order to final delivery. Navegate s combination of technology-enabled services, customs brokerage expertise, and a full complement of international and domestic services significantly reduces costs and leads to better compliance and risk mitigation for its customers. The goodwill recognized is attributable to expanded service lines and geographic footprint. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company paid in cash upon closing. The transaction was financed through proceeds received from the Company's existing credit facility. A net working capital adjustment of was finalized in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and was paid to Saltspring Capital, LLC. The aggregate purchase price of was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition.

I TEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 None. 
 I TEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023 was carried out by our management under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2023 due to the existence of material weaknesses described below. 
 In light of the material weaknesses described below, management performed additional analysis and other substantive procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 
 Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures, which: 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 As of June 30, 2023, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses discussed below. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Material Weakness over Recording and Processing of Revenue Transactions and Remediation Efforts 
 As of June 30, 2021, we concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the recording and processing of revenues transactions, including the timing of the Company s estimated accrual of in-transit revenues and related costs. 
 67 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 In response to this material weakness, the Company has continued making progress with corrective action during fiscal year 2023 to address the material weakness and provide reasonable assurance that future errors in revenue transactions would be prevented and/or detected in a timely manner. The Company s corrective actions include, but are not limited to: 
 a) Implementing new controls; 

b) Working with strategic operating partners and Company-owned locations to understand their processes and strengthen the Company s monitoring controls over their operations; 

c) Identifying and formalizing the critical data elements in our revenue accrual process; 

d) Further refining our accrual process to be more granular and operate to the desired level of precision to detect material misstatements; and 

e) Performing additional review procedures and analysis including testing of unposted shipments and subsequently analyzing posted shipments in an effort to improve the overall accuracy of the revenue accrual. 

As of June 30, 2023, remediation is ongoing. As such, we concluded the Company does not have effective internal controls over the recording and processing of revenues. Specifically, the controls as currently designed are not sufficient to prevent or detect a material misstatement in revenues as the design of the controls lacks the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenues. While existing controls have been enhanced, and new controls have been implemented, there is a need for additional enhancements around the design of those controls, including, but not limited to, the formalization of the documentation retained to evidence the performance of these controls. Further testing procedures are also needed to verify their effectiveness over multiple periods of operation. As such, the Company concluded that the material weakness related to the recording and processing of revenue transactions has not been fully remediated. We anticipate fully remediating the material weakness during fiscal year 2024. 
 Material Weaknesses over Information Technology General Controls ITGCs and Remediation Efforts 
 As of June 30, 2023, we concluded that material weaknesses exist surrounding our ITGCs, specifically relating to change management and user access rights. 
 As of June 30, 2023, the material weaknesses related to the ineffective design and operation of ITGCs over the information technology IT systems supporting the Company s Transportation Management TM systems as well as its Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system. Business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on effective IT systems, or that rely on data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs, are also deemed ineffective. The Company identified material weaknesses in their internal control over financial reporting associated with (i) not designing and maintaining effective ITGCs over privileged user accounts and developers for its TM systems used to account for revenue and related cost of transportation and its ERP system used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and (ii) not designing and maintaining effective controls to timely detect and independently review instances where individuals with access to create and implement systems changes to the TM and ERP systems. 
 In response to the material weaknesses, the Company removed certain elevated logical access privileges from user accounts and is actively enhancing existing controls that may include the addition of new controls to further strengthen our technology environment. For user access rights, this includes the implementation of additional software specifically designed to control access, which will be deployed before the end of the second quarter in fiscal year 2024. We expect the material weaknesses to be resolved in fiscal year 2024. The Company will need the refined and new controls to operate effectively for a specific period before concluding that the material weaknesses have been resolved. 
 The ITGC material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending 2023. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the remediation activities and the ITGCs material weaknesses described above, there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.5 
 RADIANT LOGISTICS, INC. 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF 
 THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 Radiant Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company, we, us and our ), has only one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended: our common stock, par value 0.001 per share common stock ). 
 The following description of our common stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our Charter ), and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (our Bylaws ), which are filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our Charter, our Bylaws and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL for additional information. 
 Authorized Shares 
 We have authority to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.001 par value per share. As of September 5, 2023, we had 47,292,971 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
 We are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.001 per share of which none are outstanding. Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix, as to any such series, any dividend rate, redemption price, preference on liquidation or dissolution, sinking fund terms, conversion rights, voting rights, and any other preference or special rights and qualifications. Any or all of the rights and preferences selected by our board of directors may be greater than the rights of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that holders of common stock will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. 
 Voting Rights 
 The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors, and do not have cumulative voting rights. 
 Dividends 
 Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to dividends as and when declared by our Board of Directors from funds legally available therefor, and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities. We have not paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our credit facilities (subject to limited exceptions). As such, it is our present policy to retain earnings, if any, for use in the development of our business. 
 Liquidation 
 Subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding preferred stock, in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any then outstanding preferred stock. 
 Rights and Preferences 
 Our common stock does not carry any preemptive rights enabling a holder to subscribe for, or receive shares of, any class of our common stock or any other securities convertible into shares of any class of our common stock, or any redemption rights. Our common stock also does not have any conversion rights, and there are no sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. 
 Stock Exchange Listing 
 Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE American under the symbol RLGT. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. The transfer agent and registrar s address is 1717 Arch Street, Suite 1300, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. 

Exhibit 4.5 
 Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of our Charter and Bylaws and the DGCL 
 Provisions of the DGCL could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging takeover or acquisition proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 
 Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute . We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover statute. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own) 15 percent or more of a corporation s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of Common Stock. 
 No Cumulative Voting . The DGCL provides that stockholders are denied the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The Company Certificate prohibits cumulative voting. 
 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors . The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors. Our certificate of incorporation provides that no director shall have any liability for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties as directors. Our bylaws include provisions that indemnify, to the fullest extent allowable under the DGCL, the personal liability of directors or officers for monetary damages for actions taken as a director or officer of the Company, or for serving at our request as a director or officer or in another position at another corporation or enterprise, as the case may be. The bylaws also provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers, subject to our receipt of an undertaking from the indemnitee as may be required under the DGCL. We are also expressly authorized to carry directors and officers insurance to protect the Company and our directors, officers, employees and agents from certain liabilities. 
 The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. We may be adversely affected to the extent that, in a class action or direct suit, we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers, employees or agents for which indemnification is sought. 
 Authorized but Unissued Shares of Common Stock . Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock will be available for future issuance without approval by the holders of common stock. We may use additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, employee benefit plans and as consideration for or to finance future acquisitions, investments or other purposes. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 
 Advance Notice Requirement . Stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures. These advance notice procedures require timely notice and apply in several situations, including stockholder proposals relating to the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors. These requirements could make it more difficult for a stockholder to bring a proposal before an annual meeting. 
 Undesignated Preferred Stock . Our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock. As a result, our board may, without the approval of our stockholders, issue shares of preferred stock with super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company. 
 Election and Removal of Directors . Our certificate of incorporation requires that directors may be removed for cause and only with the approval of the holders of at least 75 of our outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors. Any vacancy on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from increasing the size of our Board of Directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors in office. The foregoing provisions could make our acquisition by a third party, a change in our incumbent directors, or a similar change of control more difficult by limiting the methods available for removing directors. 

Exhibit 4.5 
 Amendments to Organizational Documents 
 The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. However, our bylaws provide that our stockholders may make additional bylaws and may alter and repeal any bylaws by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote upon the election of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.
