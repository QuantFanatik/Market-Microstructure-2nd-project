Market Area The Bank provides its customers with a full array of community banking services and conducts its business from its headquarters in Poplar Bluff, as well as 62 full service branch offices and three limited service branch offices, as of June 30, 2023. The branch offices are located in Poplar Bluff (4), Van Buren, Dexter (2), Kennett, Doniphan, Sikeston, Qulin, Springfield (3), Thayer (2), West Plains (2), Alton, Clever, Forsyth, Fremont Hills, Kimberling City, Ozark, Nixa, Rogersville, Marshfield, Cape Girardeau (2), Jackson, Gideon, Chaffee, Benton, Advance, Bloomfield, Essex, Rolla, Arnold, Oakville, Kansas City (2), Kearney, Lee s Summit, Macon, Maryville, Boonville, Brookfield, Chillicothe (2), Smithville, St. Joseph (2), and Trenton, Missouri; Jonesboro (2), Paragould, Batesville, Searcy, Bald Knob, Bradford, and Cabot, Arkansas; Anna, Cairo, and Tamms, Illinois; and Leawood, Kansas. In January 2023, the Company completed a merger with Citizens adding fourteen branches in markets in Missouri and Kansas, including the Kansas City and St. Joseph Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). For purposes of management and oversight of its operations, the Bank has organized its facilities into five regional markets. The Bank s east region includes 24 of its facilities, one of which is limited service, which are situated in Butler, Cape Girardeau, Carter, New Madrid, Ripley, Scott, and Stoddard counties in Missouri, and Alexander and Union counties in Illinois. These counties have a total population of approximately 245,000, and included within this market area is the Cape Girardeau MSA, which has a population of approximately 103,000. At June 30, 2023 the Bank s south region includes 13 of its facilities, one of which is limited service, which are situated in Dunklin, Howell, and Oregon counties in Missouri, and Craighead, Greene, Independence, Lonoke, and White counties in Arkansas. These counties have a total population of approximately 458,000, and included within this market area is the Jonesboro MSA, which has a population of approximately 157,000. The Cabot, Arkansas, branch in Lonoke County, is located in the northeast corner of the Little Rock MSA. The Bank s west region includes 12 of its facilities, which are situated in Christian, Greene, Phelps, Stone, Taney, and Webster counties in Missouri. These counties have a total population of approximately 571,000, and included within this market area is the Springfield MSA, which has a population of approximately 493,000. The Bank s north region includes two of its facilities, which are situated in Jefferson and St. Louis counties. The market area also includes the City of St. Louis. The two counties and the City of St. Louis have a total population of approximately 1.5 million. The north region market area is within the St. Louis MSA. The Bank s northwest region includes 15 of its facilities, one of which is limited service, which are situated in Buchanan, Clay, Cooper, Grundy, Jackson, Linn, Livingston, Macon, and Nodaway counties in Missouri, and Johnson county in Kansas. These counties have a total population of approximately 1.7 million, and some counties in this market area are located within the Kansas City MSA, or the St. Joseph MSA. Each of these markets may also serve other communities just outside the area described, but without a notable impact on the demographics of the market area. The Bank s east and south regions, and part of the northwest region. are generally rural in nature with economies supported by manufacturing activity, agriculture (livestock, dairy, poultry, rice, timber, soybeans, wheat, melons, corn, and cotton), healthcare, and education. Large employers include hospitals, manufacturers, school districts, 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 and colleges. In the west region, the Bank s operations are generally more concentrated in the Springfield, Missouri, MSA, and major employers include healthcare providers, educational institutions, federal, local, and state government, retailers, transportation and distribution firms, and leisure, entertainment, and hospitality interests. In the north region, major employers include aviation and transportation, healthcare providers, medical research, educational institutions, retailers, manufacturers, energy/utilities, and hospitality. In the portion of the northwest region within the Kansas City MSA, major employers include healthcare providers, manufacturers, medical research, educational institutions, retailers, and hospitality. For purposes of the Bank s lending policy, the Bank s primary lending area is considered to be the counties where the Bank has a branch facility, and any contiguous county. Competition The Bank faces strong competition in attracting deposits (its primary source of lendable funds) and originating loans. The most recent market share data by the FDIC reflected that the Bank was one of 28 bank or saving association groups located in its east region competing for approximately 7.8 billion in deposits at FDIC-insured institutions, one of 44 bank or saving association groups located in its south region (13 of these institutions overlap with the Bank s other regions) competing for 12.3 billion in deposits, one of 43 bank or savings association groups located in its west region (19 of these overlap with the Bank s other regions) competing for 17.0 billion in deposits, one of 60 bank or savings association groups located in its north region (24 of these overlap with the Bank s other regions) competing for 97.5 billion in deposits, and one of 107 bank or savings association groups located in its northwest region (six of these overlap with the Bank s other regions) competing for 79.1 billion in deposits. Competitors for deposits include commercial banks, credit unions, digital payment applications, money market funds, and other investment alternatives, such as mutual funds, full service and discount broker-dealers, equity markets, brokerage accounts and government securities. The Bank s competition for loans comes principally from other financial institutions, mortgage banking companies, mortgage brokers and life insurance companies. The Bank expects competition to continue to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes within the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to market entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which permits affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, also has changed the competitive environment in which the Bank conducts business. Lending Activities General. The Bank s lending activities consist of originating loans secured by mortgages on one- to four-family and multi-family residential real estate, commercial and agricultural real estate, construction loans on residential and commercial properties, commercial and agricultural business loans, and consumer loans. The Bank has also occasionally purchased loan participation interests originated by other lenders. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had purchased participation interests in 86 loans with balances outstanding totaling 155.6 million. Supervision of the loan portfolio is the responsibility of our Chief Lending Officer, Rick Windes, Regional President Justin Cox, and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark Hecker (our Senior Lending and Credit Officers ). The Chief Lending Officer and Regional President are responsible for oversight of loan production. The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for oversight of underwriting, loan policy, and administration. Loan officers have varying amounts of lending authority depending upon experience and types of loans. Loans beyond their authority are presented to the next level of authority, which may include one of five Regional Loan Committees, the Senior Loan Committee, an Agricultural Loan Committee, a Senior Agricultural Loan Committee, an SBA Loan Committee, or a Bank Executive Loan Committee. The Regional Loan Committees each consists of one director appointed by the Board of Directors and lenders selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers, and is authorized to approve lending relationships up to 4.0 million. The Senior Loan Committee consists of our Senior Lending and Credit Officers and lenders selected by them

 that have a higher level of lending experience. The Senior Loan Committee is authorized to approve lending relationships up to 10.0 million. The Bank s Agricultural Loan Committee consists of several lending officers with agricultural lending experience selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers, and is authorized to approve agricultural lending relationships up to 4.0 million. The Senior Agricultural Loan Committee is authorized to approve agricultural lending relationships up to 10.0 million and consists of our Chief Credit Officer, as well as several senior lending officers with agricultural lending experience selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers. The Bank Executive Loan Committee consists of our Senior Lending and Credit Officers, plus our Chairman/CEO and our President/Chief Administrative Officer. In addition to the approval of the Senior Loan Committee or the Bank Executive Loan Committee, lending relationships in excess of 10.0 million require the approval of the Directors Loan Committee, which is comprised of all Bank directors. All loans are subject to ratification by the full Board of Directors. The aggregate amount of loans that the Bank is permitted to make under applicable federal regulations to any one borrower, including related entities, or the aggregate amount that the Bank could have invested in any one real estate project, is based on the Bank s capital levels. At June 30, 2023, the maximum amount which the Bank could lend to any one borrower and the borrower s related entities was approximately 115.8 million. At June 30, 2023, the Bank s ten largest credit relationships, as defined by loan to one borrower limitations, ranged from 76.8 million to 20.7 million, net of participation interests sold. As of June 30, 2023, the majority of these credits were commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, or commercial business loans, and all of these relationships were performing in accordance with their terms.

The Bank actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. These loans are originated as a result of customer and real estate agent referrals, existing and walk-in customers, and from responses to the Bank s marketing campaigns. At June 30, 2023, residential loans secured by one- to four-family residences totaled 740.5 million, or 20.7 of net loans receivable. The Bank currently offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ARM loans. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Bank originated 38.4 million of ARM loans and 125.7 million of fixed-rate loans that were secured by one- to four-family residences, for retention in the Bank s portfolio. An additional 21.5 million in fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans were originated for sale on the secondary market. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Bank s portfolio are secured by property located within the Bank s market area. Fixed rate one- to four- family loans represented 81.3 of the one- to four- family portfolio with a weighted average maturity of 15.7 years. The Bank generally originates one- to four-family residential mortgage loans for retention in its portfolio in amounts up to 90 of the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of residential property. For loans originated in excess of 80 loan-to-value, the Bank generally charges an additional 25-75 basis points, but does not require private mortgage insurance. At June 30, 2023, the outstanding balance of loans originated with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80 was 129.2 million. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, and 2019, originations of one- to four-family loans in excess of 80 loan-to-value have totaled 27.3 million, 50.8 million, 52.2 million, 45.9 million, and 23.3 million, respectively, totaling 199.5 million. The outstanding balance of those loans at June 30, 2023, was 110.7 million. Originating loans with higher loan-to-value ratios presents additional credit risk to the Bank. Consequently, the Bank limits this product to borrowers with a favorable credit history and a demonstrable ability to service the debt. The majority of new residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank for retention in its portfolio conform to secondary market underwriting standards; however, documentation of loan files may not be adequate to allow for immediate sale. The interest rates charged on these loans are competitively priced based on local market conditions, the availability of funding, and anticipated profit margins. Fixed and ARM loans originated by the Bank are amortized over periods as long as 30 years, but typically are repaid over shorter periods. Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities up to 30 years, and are generally fully amortizing with payments due monthly. These loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time because of refinancing and other prepayments. A significant change in the interest rate

 environment can alter the average life of a residential loan portfolio. The one- to four-family fixed-rate loans do not contain prepayment penalties. At June 30, 2023, one- to four-family loans with a fixed rate totaled 586.4 million and had a weighted-average maturity of 188 months. The Bank also originates one- to four-family ARM loans, which adjust annually, after an initial period of one to seven years. Typically, originated ARM loans secured by owner occupied properties reprice at a margin of 2.75 to 3.00 over the weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year CMT ). Generally, ARM loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties are tied to the Wall Street Journal prime rate. Owner occupied residential ARM loan originations are subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps and floors. As a consequence of using interest rate caps, initial rates which may be at a premium or discount, and a CMT loan index, the interest earned on the Bank s ARMs will react differently to changing interest rates than the Bank s cost of funds. At June 30, 2023, one- to four-family loans tied to the CMT index totaled 89.9 million. One- to four-family loans tied to other indices totaled 65.9 million. In underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans, the Bank evaluates the borrower s ability to meet debt service requirements at current as well as fully indexed rates for ARM loans, and the value of the property securing the loan. Most properties securing real estate loans made by the Bank during fiscal 2023 had appraisals performed on them by independent fee appraisers approved and qualified by the Board of Directors. The Bank generally requires borrowers to obtain title insurance and fire, property and flood insurance (if indicated) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Bank generally contain a due on sale clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property. The Bank also originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company s primary market area, but made to borrowers who operate within the primary market area. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 393.0 million, or 11.0 of net loans receivable, in multi-family residential real estate. Fixed rate loans secured by multi-family residential properties represented 85.7 of the multi-family residential property portfolio with a weighted average maturity of 7.6 years. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Bank are amortized over periods generally up to 25 years, with balloon maturities up to ten years. Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is typical for the Bank to include an interest rate floor and ceiling in variable-rate loan agreements. Variable rate loans typically adjust daily, monthly, quarterly or annually based on the Wall Street prime interest rate. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed 85 of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. The Bank generally requires a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser to be engaged in determining the collateral value. As a general rule, the Bank requires the unlimited guaranty of all individuals (or entities) owning (directly or indirectly) 20 or more of the borrowing entity. The primary risk associated with multi-family loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. High unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in borrowers having to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates. In an effort to reduce these risks, the Bank evaluates the guarantor s ability to inject personal funds as a tertiary source of repayment. Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Bank actively originates loans secured by commercial real estate including farmland, single- and multi-tenant retail properties, restaurants, hotels, nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities, land (improved and unimproved), convenience stores, automobile dealerships, and other automotive-related services, warehouses and distribution centers, and other businesses generally located in the Bank s market area. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 1.6 billion in commercial real estate loans, which represented 43.8 of net loans receivable. Of this amount, 238.1 million were loans secured by agricultural properties. The Bank expects to maintain, and may increase, the percentage of commercial real estate loans, inclusive of agricultural properties, in its total portfolio. Fixed rate commercial real estate loans represented 82.8 of the commercial real estate portfolio with a weighted average maturity of 5.1 years.

Table of Contents 
 Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are generally based on amortization schedules of up to 25 years with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, these loans have fixed interest rates and maturities ranging up to ten years, with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually, based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate, after an initial fixed-rate period up to seven years. The Bank typically includes an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. Generally, loans for improved commercial properties do not exceed 80 of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Agricultural real estate terms offered differ slightly, with amortization schedules of up to 25 years with an 80 loan-to-value ratio, or 30 years with a 75 loan-to-value ratio. Agricultural real estate loans generally require annual, instead of monthly, payments. Before credit is extended, the Bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower s credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property and the value of the property itself. Generally, personal guarantees are obtained from the borrower in addition to obtaining the secured property as collateral for such loans. The Bank also generally requires appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate to be performed by a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser. Generally, loans secured by commercial real estate involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the secured property, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. See Asset Quality. Construction Lending. The Bank originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 550.0 million, or 15.4 of net loans receivable in construction loans outstanding and loans in process. Construction loans originated by the Bank are generally secured by mortgage loans for the construction of owner occupied residential real estate or to finance speculative construction secured by residential real estate, land development, or owner-occupied or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. At June 30, 2023, 124.7 million of the Bank s construction loans outstanding and loans in process were secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, 255.7 million were secured by multi-family residential real estate, and 169.6 million were secured by commercial real estate. During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments with single-family residential construction loans maturing in nine to twelve months, while multi-family or commercial construction loans typically mature in 12 to 36 months. Once construction is completed, construction loans may be converted to permanent financing, generally with monthly payments using amortization schedules of up to 30 years on residential and up to 25 years on commercial real estate. Speculative construction and land development lending generally affords the Bank an opportunity to receive higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than those obtainable from residential lending. Nevertheless, construction and land development lending is generally considered to involve a higher level of credit risk than one- to four-family residential lending due to (i) the concentration of principal among relatively few borrowers and development projects, (ii) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of accurately estimating building or development costs and the selling price of the finished product, (iii) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring and disbursing funds for the loan, (iv) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest and changes in local economic conditions, and (v) the increased difficulty of working out problem loans. Due in part to these risk factors, the Bank may be required from time to time to modify or extend the terms of some of these types of loans. In an effort to reduce these risks, the application process includes a submission to the Bank of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed. These items are also used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property. Loan amounts are generally limited to 80 of the lesser of current appraised value and/or the cost of construction. Consumer Lending. The Bank offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including: home equity, automobile, second mortgage, mobile home and deposit-secured loans. The Bank originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary market area. Generally, consumer loans are originated with fixed rates for terms of up to approximately 66 months, with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest, and are 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 for a period of ten years. At June 30, 2023, the Bank s consumer loan portfolio totaled 133.5 million, or 3.7 of net loans receivable. Home equity loans represented 48.7 of the Bank s consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2023, and totaled 65.1 million, or 1.8 of net loans receivable. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust or mortgage and are generally issued for up to 90 of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage. Interest rates on HELOCs are adjustable and are tied to the current prime interest rate, generally with an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. This rate is obtained from the Wall Street Journal and adjusts on a daily basis. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. HELOCs are secured by residential properties, which is generally considered to be stronger collateral than that securing other consumer loans. In addition, because of the adjustable rate structure, HELOCs present less interest rate risk to the Bank. Consumer loans for the purchase of automobiles represented 16.3 of the Bank s consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2023, and totaled 21.8 million, or 0.6 of net loans receivable. Of that total, an immaterial amount was originated by auto dealers. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to 66 months for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to 100 of the purchase price of the vehicle. Consumer loan rates and terms vary according to the type of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower, which is evaluated using credit scoring. Consumers with additional qualifying Bank products are eligible for additional pricing discounts. The underwriting standards employed for consumer loans include employment stability, a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts, and an assessment of ability to meet existing and proposed obligations. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, because they are generally unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable or mobile assets, such as automobiles. In the event of repossession or default, there may be no secondary source of repayment or the underlying value of the collateral could be insufficient to repay the loan. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. The Bank s delinquency levels for these types of loans are reflective of these risks. See Asset Classification. Commercial Business Lending. The Bank s commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 599.0 million in commercial business loans outstanding, or 16.8 of net loans receivable. Of this amount, 138.3 million were loans related to agriculture, including amortizing equipment loans and annual production lines. The Bank expects to maintain, and may increase, the percentage of commercial business loans in its total loan portfolio. The Bank currently offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial business loans. At fiscal year end, fixed rate commercial loans represented 58.0 of the commercial loan portfolio with a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years. The adjustable rate business loans typically reprice daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually, in accordance with the Wall Street prime rate of interest. The Bank typically includes an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. Commercial business loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to five years, while commercial operating lines of credit or agricultural production lines are generally for a one year period. The Bank s commercial business loans are evaluated based on the loan application, a determination of the applicant s

 payment history on other debts, business stability and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Small Business Administration (SBA) Lending. The Bank s commercial and construction business lending activity includes some loans guaranteed by the SBA. In fiscal 2023, 6.4 million in originations was guaranteed by the SBA, and as of June 30, 2023, the Company held balances of 9.5 million in its portfolio representing the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans it had originated. The Company had sold and was servicing 60.9 million of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as of June 30, 2023. Contractual Obligations and Commitments, Including Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . The following table discloses our fixed and determinable contractual obligations and commercial commitments by payment date as of June 30, 2023.

Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases Generally, loans are originated by the Bank s staff, who are salaried loan officers. All loan officers are eligible for bonuses based on production, market performance, and credit quality. Certain lenders, in particular those originating higher volume of residential loans for sale on the secondary market, may earn a relatively higher percentage of their total compensation through bonuses. Loans are originated both to be held for investment and to be sold into the secondary market. Loan applications are generally taken and processed at each of the Bank s full-service locations and online for single-family residential loans. While the Bank originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans, the ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its market. In fiscal 2023, the Bank originated 1.2 billion of loans, compared to 1.1 billion and 971.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Of these loans, mortgage loan originations were 1.0 billion, 970.1 million, and 771.2 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Increases in originations over recent periods is attributed to increased lending activity, increased borrower refinancing, and an expanded market area and customer base following recent mergers. From time to time, the Bank has purchased loan participations consistent with its loan underwriting standards. During fiscal 2023, the Bank committed to purchase 118.7 million of new loan participations. At June 30, 2023, outstanding balances on loan participations purchased totaled 155.6 million, or 3.6 of net loans receivable. An additional 144.6 million is available to be drawn on these purchased participation loans. At June 30, 2023, all of these participations were performing in accordance with their respective terms. The Bank evaluates additional loan participations on an ongoing basis, based in part on local loan demand, liquidity, portfolio and capital levels.

(2) Amount reported in fiscal 2022 includes the Company s acquisitions of loans from the Fortune and Cairo mergers recorded at a 202.1 million and 408,000 fair values, respectively. Loan Commitments The Bank issues commitments for single- and multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, operating or working capital lines of credit, and standby letters-of-credit. Such commitments may be oral or in writing with specified terms, conditions and at a specified rate of interest. The Bank had outstanding net loan commitments of approximately 912.0 million at June 30, 2023. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. Loan Fees In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives income from fees in connection with loan originations, loan modifications, late payments and for miscellaneous services related to its loans. Income from these activities varies from period to period depending upon the volume and type of loans made and competitive conditions. Asset Quality Delinquent Loans. Generally, when a borrower fails to make a required payment, the Bank begins the collection process by mailing a computer generated notice to the customer. If the delinquency is not cured promptly, the customer is contacted again by notice or telephone. After an account secured by real estate becomes over 60 days past due, the Bank will typically send a demand notice to the customer which, if not cured within the time provided or unless satisfactory arrangements have been made, will lead to foreclosure. Foreclosure may not begin until the loan reaches 
 17 

Table of Contents 
 120 days delinquency in the case of consumer residential loans. For consumer loans, the Missouri Right-To-Cure Statute is followed, which requires issuance of specifically worded notices at specific time intervals prior to repossession or further collection efforts. The following table sets forth the Bank s loan delinquencies by type and by amount at June 30, 2023. 

Loans Delinquent For: Total Loans Delinquent 60 Days 60-89 Days 90 Days and Over or More Numbers Amounts Numbers Amounts Numbers Amounts (Dollars in thousands) Residential real estate 6 401 7 483 13 884 Commercial real estate 5 1,854 4 1,580 9 3,434 Construction 1 311 2 698 3 1,009 Consumer 13 124 6 212 19 336 Commercial Business 2 77 12 789 14 866 Totals 27 2,767 31 3,762 58 6,529 Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in the Bank s loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful, and as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan is removed from current income. The Bank has no reserves for uncollected interest and does not accrue interest on non-accrual loans. A loan may be transferred back to accrual status once a satisfactory repayment history has been restored. Foreclosed assets held for sale include assets acquired in settlement of loans and are shown net of reserves. The increase in nonperforming assets in fiscal 2023 was attributed primarily to nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned acquired in the Citizens merger. For information regarding accrual of interest on loans, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. The Company may treat purchased credit deteriorated loans as an accruing asset because these loans are recorded at acquisition at fair value, which includes an accretable discount recorded as interest income over the expected life of the obligation.

At June 30, 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccruing loans: Residential real estate 934 1,647 3,235 4,010 6,404 Construction 698 30 Commercial real estate 4,564 2,259 1,914 3,106 10,876 Consumer 256 73 100 196 309 Commercial business 1,091 139 589 1,345 3,424 Total 7,543 4,118 5,868 8,657 21,013 Loans 90 days past due accruing interest: Residential real estate 109 Construction Commercial real estate Consumer Commercial business Total 109 Total nonperforming loans 7,652 4,118 5,868 8,657 21,013 Nonperforming investments Foreclosed assets held for sale: Real estate owned 3,606 2,180 2,227 2,561 3,723 Other nonperforming assets 32 11 23 9 29 Total nonperforming assets 11,290 6,309 8,118 11,227 24,765 Total nonperforming loans to net loans 0.21 0.15 0.27 0.40 1.14 Total nonperforming loans to total assets 0.17 0.13 0.22 0.34 0.95 Total nonperforming assets to total assets 0.26 0.20 0.30 0.44 1.12 At June 30, 2023, Troubled Debt Restructurings TDRs totaled 30.5 million, of which 727,000 was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining 29.8 million in TDRs have complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and are therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. At June 30, 2022, TDRs totaled 31.4 million, of which 807,000 was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. In general, these loans were subject to classification as TDRs at June 30, 2023 and 2022, on the basis of guidance under ASU 2011- 02 Receivables: A Creditor s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring , which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted. Real Estate Owned. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated disposition costs, which establishes a new cost basis. If fair value at the date of foreclosure is lower than the balance of the related loan, the difference will be charged-off to the allowance for credit losses at the time of transfer. Management periodically updates real estate valuations and if the value declines, a specific provision for losses on such property is established by a charge to noninterest expense. At June 30, 2023, the Company s balance of real estate owned totaled 3.6 million, all in non-residential properties. Asset Classification. Applicable regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, regulatory examiners have 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it charges off the balance of the assets. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses, may be designated as special mention. The Bank s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances. On the basis of management s review of the assets of the Company, at June 30, 2023, adversely classified assets totaled 50.0 million, or 1.15 of total assets as compared to 29.3 million, or 0.91 of total assets at June 30, 2022. Of the amount adversely classified as of June 30, 2023, 50.0 million was considered substandard, and none was considered doubtful. Included in adversely classified assets at June 30, 2023, were various loans totaling 46.3 million (see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for more information on adversely classified loans) and foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets totaling 3.6 million. Adversely classified loans are so designated due to concerns regarding the borrower s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. The increase in classified loans was attributable in part to a limited number of commercial real estate loans secured by hotel properties with combined balances of 23.4 million and 14.9 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. These borrowers requested and received payment deferrals or modifications due to the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on their operations, and were not able to return to their previously contracted arrangements by June 30, 2022. Since that date, they have become current on their payments, but there is some concern for their ability to generate enough cash flow to service the debt. Adversely classified loans totaling 9.6 million had been placed on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2023, of which 6.5 million were more than 30 days delinquent. Of the remaining 36.7 million of adversely classified loans, 2.6 million were more than 30 days delinquent. Other Loans of Concern. In addition to the adversely classified assets above, there were also other loans with respect to which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to continue to comply with present loan terms, which may ultimately result in the adverse classification of such assets. These loans continued to perform according to contractual terms as of June 30, 2023, but were identified as having elevated risk due to concerns regarding the borrower s ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. At June 30, 2023, these other loans of concern totaled 27.9 million, as compared to 24.4 million at June 30, 2022. Allowance for Credit Losses. The Bank s allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses based on management s expectation of lifetime credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. Management estimates the ACL using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments may be made to historical loss information for differences identified in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards or terms; lending review systems; experience, ability, or depth of lending management and staff; portfolio growth and mix; delinquency levels and trends; as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic activity or employment, agricultural economic conditions, property values, or other relevant factors. These provisions for credit losses are charged against earnings in the year they are established. The Bank had an allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2023, of 47.8 million, which represented 424 of nonperforming assets as compared to an allowance of 33.2 million, which represented 526 of nonperforming assets at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, the Bank also had an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of 6.3 million, as compared to 3.4 million at June 30, 2022. This amount is maintained as a separate liability account to cover estimated credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees. The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in anticipated draws of available credit and changes in the mix of loan types anticipated to be funded.

 Although management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance, unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments and net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used in making the final determination. Future additions to the allowance will likely be the result of periodic loan, property and collateral reviews and thus cannot be predicted with certainty in advance. Further discussion of the methodology used in establishing the allowance is provided in Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses in section of Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Investment Activities General. Under Missouri law, the Bank is permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Government and State of Missouri obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and obligations of States and their political sub-divisions. Generally, the investment policy of the Company is to invest funds among various categories of investments and repricing characteristics based upon the Bank s need for liquidity, to provide collateral for borrowings and public unit deposits, to help reach financial performance targets and to help maintain asset/liability management objectives.

Investment purchases and/or sales must be authorized by the asset/liability management committee or an authorized executive officer, depending on the aggregate size of the investment transaction, prior to any investment transaction. The Board of Directors of the Bank reviews all investment transactions. All investment purchases are identified as available-for-sale AFS at the time of purchase. The Company has not classified any investment securities as held-to-maturity over the last five years. Securities classified as AFS must be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity.

The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans, MBS and CMOs, interest and principal received on investment securities and other short-term investments, and funds provided from operating results. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and overall economic conditions. Borrowings, including FHLB advances, have been used at times to provide additional liquidity. Borrowings are used on an overnight or short-term basis to compensate for periodic fluctuations in cash flows, and are used on a longer term basis to fund loan growth and to help manage the Company s sensitivity to fluctuating interest rates. Deposits. The Bank s depositors are generally residents and entities located in the States of Missouri, Arkansas, or Illinois. Deposits are attracted from within the Bank s market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, money market deposit accounts, saving accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans. At times, the Company will utilize brokered deposits in lieu of borrowings, subject to market pricing and availability. For larger depositors, such as public units, the Company often utilizes a reciprocal deposit program to provide additional FDIC coverage to our customer through other

 financial institutions while conveniently allowing management of the deposit relationship through our institution. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds may remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current market interest rates, profitability to the Bank, managing interest rate sensitivity and its customer preferences and concerns. The Bank s Asset/Liability Committee regularly reviews its deposit mix and pricing. The Bank will periodically promote a particular deposit product as part of its overall marketing plan. Deposit products have been promoted through various mediums, which include digital and social media, television, radio and newspaper advertisements, as well as grassroots marketing techniques, such as sponsorship of or activity at community events. The emphasis of these campaigns is to increase consumer awareness and market share of the Bank. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition. Based on its experience, the Bank believes that its deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. However, the ability of the Bank to attract and maintain money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

 GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to the supervision and regulation of the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this prospectus do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Missouri state legislature that may affect the operations of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Financial Regulatory Reform. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act imposed various restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and their holding companies. In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Act ), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank. The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and offers optional, simplified regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR of between 8 and 10 percent. Effective, January 1, 2022, the CBLR requirement was 9.0 . Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the community bank leverage ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. The Act also expanded the category of holding companies that may rely on the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement (the HC Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from 1 billion to 3 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. The Bank General. As a state-chartered, federally insured trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation. Lending activities and other investments must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, including prescribed minimum capital standards. The Bank is regularly examined by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance and files periodic reports concerning the Bank s activities and financial condition with its regulators. The Bank s relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal law and the laws of Missouri, especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents. Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the Bank, including reserves, loans, mortgages, capital, trust services issuance of securities, payment of dividends, and establishment of branches. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, and in other circumstances. The FRB as the primary federal regulator of the Company and the Bank has authority to impose 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 penalties, initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices. State Regulation and Supervision. As a state-chartered trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Missouri law and the regulations of the Missouri Division of Finance. Missouri law and regulations govern the Bank s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts). These reserves may be in the form of cash or deposits with the institution s regional Federal Reserve Bank. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the reserve requirement ratio to 0 for all account types, eliminating reserve requirements for all depository institutions, to support lending to households and businesses. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The purpose of the discount window is to provide an additional backstop funding option for eligible depository institutions seeking to supplement their funding sources, particularly to meet unexpected short-term funding needs. Depository institutions like the Bank would typically utilize FHLB borrowings before borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window. The Bank has also been approved for participation in the BTFP introduced early in calendar year 2023 by the Federal Reserve Bank, but the Bank has not pledged any securities under the program. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide home financing credit. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Des Moines, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Borrowings. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 11.5 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank received 555,000 and 239,000 in dividends from the FHLB of Des Moines for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank s FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank s capital. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . The Bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC. The general insurance limit is 250,000 per account relationship. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against a member bank of the FRB after giving the FRB an opportunity to take such action. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has issued regulations setting insurance premium assessments based on an institution s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital instead of its deposits. The Bank s FDIC premiums are based on its supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios.

Table of Contents 
 On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase its initial base insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points to improve the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF would be restored to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. The revised assessment rate schedules became effective January 1, 2023, with the first invoice payment date of June 30, 2023 for the assessment period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance. Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits Guidelines ). The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Guidance on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on subprime mortgage lending to address issues related to certain mortgage products marketed to subprime borrowers, particularly adjustable rate mortgage products that can involve payment shock and other risky characteristics. Although the guidance focuses on subprime borrowers, the banking agencies note that institutions should look to the principles contained in the guidance when offering such adjustable rate mortgages to non-subprime borrowers. The guidance prohibits predatory lending programs; provides that institutions should underwrite a mortgage loan on the borrower s ability to repay the debt by its final maturity at the fully-indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule; encourages reasonable workout arrangements with borrowers who are in default; mandates clear and balanced advertisements and other communications; encourages arrangements for the escrowing of real estate taxes and insurance; and states that institutions should develop strong control and monitoring systems. The federal banking agencies have announced their intention to carefully review the risk management and consumer compliance processes, policies and procedures of their supervised financial institutions and their intention to take action against institutions that engage in predatory lending practices, violate consumer protection laws or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices. Guidance on Commercial Real Estate Concentrations . The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and maintaining capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: total loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 or more of the bank s total capital; or total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) greater than 300 of the Bank s total capital and an increase in the bank s commercial real estate portfolio of 50 or more during the prior 36 months. Regulatory Capital Requirements . The Bank is required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Effective January 1, 2015, (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness on January 1, 2019), the Bank became subject to capital regulations which created required minimum ratio for common equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital and the minimum leverage ratio; established risk-weightings for assets and certain off-balance sheet items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; required an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based capital ratios; and defined what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the Basel III requirements. Under applicable capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0 of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0 . CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI except in the case of banking organizations that have elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, as discussed below; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. In addition to the capital requirements, there were a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to earlier regulations, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. Because of our asset size, we had the one-time option of deciding whether to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We made the decision to opt out. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, when a buffer greater than 0.625 of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount increased by 0.625 each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019. At June 30, 2022, the Bank and the Company reported risk-based capital ratios meeting the capital conservation buffer. Under the prompt corrective action standards of the FRB, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.5 , a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8 , a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10 , and a leverage ratio of at least 5 ; and in order to be considered adequately capitalized, it must have the minimum capital ratios described above. To be considered well-capitalized a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, at least a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 and not be subject to a higher enforceable individualized capital requirement. At June 30, 2022, the Bank and the Company were categorized as well capitalized under these prompt corrective action standards. Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Subject to certain regulatory exceptions, the FDIA and FDIC regulations provide that an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as principal in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund and that the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements.

Table of Contents 
 Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2 of the bank s total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10 of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors , trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending to or otherwise engaging in transactions with the Company (or any other affiliate), generally limiting such transactions with an affiliate to 10 of the Bank s capital and surplus and limiting all such transactions with all affiliates to 20 of the Bank s capital and surplus. Such transactions, including extensions of credit, sales of securities or assets and provision of services, also must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies. Federally insured banks are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain additional restrictions (including collateralization) on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, such banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service. Community Reinvestment Act. Banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its regular examination of a bank, to assess the bank s record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency s assessment of the bank s record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any bank which has applied, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a financial institution. The Bank received a satisfactory rating during its most recent CRA examination. On May 5, 2022, the federal bank regulatory agencies overhauled the CRA and jointly issued a proposal to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed regulations included major changes from the current regulation and will be effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 60 days after the publication date of the final rules. The new rules as proposed are intended to, (1) provide expanded access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (2) address changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (3) yield greater clarity, consistency, and transparency, (4) tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type and (4) maintain a unified approach amongst the regulating agencies. Dividends. Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds that may be paid by the Company. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. The amount of dividends actually paid by the Bank during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank s management policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Dividends can be restricted if the capital conservation buffer is not maintained as described under Capital Rules above. A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends from certain undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired. Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. Privacy Standards and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to federal regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of their information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a computer-security incident rising to the level of a notification incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization s customers for four or more hours. Further, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted final rules that require public companies to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and detailed information regarding their cybersecurity risk management and governance on an annual basis on Form 10-K. Companies will be required to report on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material within four business days of making that determination. In addition to incident reporting, the new rules will also require companies to describe their cybersecurity processes and governance. The Company Federal Securities Law. The stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). As such, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Company s stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. Bank Holding Company Regulation. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act BHCA ). As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and the Company and its non-banking 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 affiliates are subject to examination by the FRB. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy the FRB may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, this policy is codified and rules to implement it are to be established. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. The Company is subject to the activity limitations imposed on bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain activities which are permitted, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. TAXATION Federal Taxation General. The Company and the Bank report their income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank s reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company. Bad Debt Reserve. Historically, savings institutions, such as the Bank used to be, which met certain definitional tests primarily related to their assets and the nature of their business qualifying thrift ), were permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto, which may have been deducted in arriving at their taxable income. The Bank s deductions with respect to their loans, which are generally loans secured by certain interests in real property, historically has been computed using an amount based on the Bank s actual loss experience, in accordance with IRC Section 585(B)(2). Due to the Bank s loss experience, the Bank generally recognized a bad debt deduction equal to their net charge-offs. The Bank s average assets for the current year exceeded 500 million, thus classifying it as a large bank for purposes of IRC Section 585. Under IRC Section 585(c)(3), a bank that becomes a large bank must change its method of accounting from the reserve method to a specific charge-off method under IRC Section 166. The Bank s deductions with respect to their loans are computed under the specific charge-off method. The specific charge-off method has been used in the current year and will be used in all subsequent tax years. Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its income 100 of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is generally 50 in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank owns more than 20 of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend, then 65 of any dividends received may be deducted.

 Missouri Taxation General. Missouri-based banks, such as the Bank, are subject to a Missouri bank franchise and income tax. Bank Franchise Tax. The Missouri bank franchise tax is imposed on the bank s taxable income at the rate of 4.48 , less credits for certain Missouri taxes, including income taxes. However, the credits exclude taxes paid for real estate, unemployment taxes, bank tax, and taxes on tangible personal property owned by the Bank and held for lease or rentals to others - income-based calculation. Income Tax. The Bank and its holding company and related subsidiaries are subject to an income tax that is imposed on the consolidated taxable income apportioned to Missouri at the rate of 4.0 . The return is filed on a consolidated basis by all members of the consolidated group including the Bank. Earnings Tax. Due to its loan activity and the acquisition of Kansas City banks in the most recent period, the Bank is subject to a Kansas City earnings tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 1.0 . Arkansas Taxation General. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Arkansas banks in recent periods, the Bank is subject to an Arkansas income tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 6.2 . Illinois Taxation General. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Illinois banks in recent periods, the Bank and its holding company and related subsidiaries are subject to an income tax that is imposed on the consolidated taxable income apportioned to Illinois at the rate of 9.5 . Kansas Taxation Privilege Tax. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Kansas banks in the most recent period, the Bank is subject to a Kansas privilege tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 3.95 . Audits The Company s Missouri income tax returns for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2016 through 2018 are under audit by the Missouri Department of Revenue. There have been no IRS or other state audits of the Company s federal or state income tax returns during the past five years.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our securities is subject to inherent risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Relating to the Company and the Bank Risks Relating to Marco Economic Conditions Recent events in the financial services industry may have a material adverse effect on us. Recent events in the financial services industry, including the failures of two large U.S. banks in the span of three days in March 2023 and another failure in early May 2023, created industry-wide concerns related to liquidity, deposit outflows, uninsured deposit concentrations and eroding consumer confidence in the banking system. These events occurred against the backdrop of a rapidly rising interest rate environment which, among other things, has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks and more competition for bank deposits. These events have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC acted to fully protect the insured and uninsured depositors of two of the recently failed banks, and the FDIC secured an agreement with a large financial institution for that institution to assume all the deposits of the third recently failed bank, no assurance can be given that these or similar actions will restore confidence in the banking system, and we may be further impacted by concerns regarding the soundness of other financial institutions, or other future bank failures or disruptions. Any loss of customer deposits could increase our cost of funding or negatively affect our overall liquidity or capital. The cost of resolving the recent bank failures may prompt the FDIC to charge higher deposit insurance premiums and/or impose special assessments on insured depository institutions. These events and any future similar events may also result in changes to laws or regulations governing bank holding companies and banks, including higher capital requirements, or the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in economic conditions, particularly an economic slowdown in southern Missouri or northern Arkansas, could hurt our business. Our business is directly affected by market conditions, trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Future deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within our primary market area in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, could result in the following consequences, among others, any of which could hurt our business materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decline; loan collateral may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power and reducing the value of collateral securing our loans; and 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. 
 Downturns in the real estate markets in our primary market area could hurt our business. Our business activities and credit exposure are primarily concentrated in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas. While we did not and do not have a sub-prime lending program, our residential real estate, construction and land loan portfolios, our commercial and multi-family loan portfolios and certain of our other loans could be affected by the downturn in the real estate market. We anticipate that significant declines in the real estate markets in our primary market area would hurt our business and would mean that collateral for our loans would hold less value. As a result, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. The events and conditions described in this risk factor could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Inflationary pressures and rising prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 to levels not seen in more than 40 years. Small and medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation, as they are not able to leverage economies of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect us. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our customers reside and operate. Because of its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its customers, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of this impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on the Company and its customers, which are difficult to quantify in the near-term or long-term. We could be subject to a number of risks as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in demand for our products and services; increased loan losses or other impairments in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses; a decline in collateral for our loans, especially real estate; unanticipated unavailability of employees; increased cyber security risks to the extent employees work remotely; a prolonged weakness in economic conditions; and increased costs as we and our regulators, customers and third-party service providers adapt to evolving pandemic conditions. Severe weather and other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, new public health issues or other adverse external events could harm our business. Severe weather and other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, new public health issues or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of our facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate these risks. Such events could also affect the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely affect our employees, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interfere with our borrowers abilities to repay their debt obligations to us.

 Risks Relating to Credit and Lending Activities Our allowance for credit losses may be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. Lending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to ensure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things: cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed; in the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral; the credit history of a particular borrower; changes in economic and industry conditions; and the duration of the loan. 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses which we believe is appropriate to provide for expected losses over the life of loans in our portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to: historical default and loss experience; historical recovery experience; economic conditions; evaluation of non-performing loans; the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans. risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans; and the rate of growth, quality, size and diversity of the loan portfolio; 
 If actual credit losses exceed the projections modeled in arriving at our estimate of the allowance for credit losses, our business, financial condition and profitability may suffer. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU), 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on June 16, 2016, which changed previous allowance for loan losses methodology to consider current expected credit losses (CECL). This accounting pronouncement was applicable to us effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve have adopted rules that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year or five-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. We elected the five-year period for our Company. CECL has substantially changed how we calculate our allowance for credit losses. We have adopted CECL and prepared our consolidated financial statements based on the required methodology; however we cannot predict how it will affect our results of operations and financial condition over time, including our regulatory capital. In general, expectations are that the CECL methodology will lead to increased volatility in banking organizations required level of allowances at different points in the economic cycle, and in their results of operations.

 If our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected. At June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, our nonperforming assets were 11.3 million and 6.3 million, respectively, or 0.26 and 0.20 of total assets, respectively. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways: We do not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans, nonperforming investment securities, or other real estate owned. We must provide for expected credit losses through a current period charge to the provision for credit losses. Non-interest expense increases when we must write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. There are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to our other real estate owned. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can divert management s attention from more profitable activities. 
 If additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See also Regulation Regulatory Capital Requirements. Our construction lending exposes us to significant risk. Our construction loan portfolio, which totaled 550.1 million, or 15.4 of loans, net, at June 30, 2023, includes residential and non-residential construction and development loans. Construction and development lending, especially non-residential construction and development lending, is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional one-to-four-family residential lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and sale, leasing, or operation of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are often more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy than other real estate loans. These loans are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Additionally, we may experience significant construction loan losses because independent appraisers or project engineers inaccurately estimate the cost or value of construction loan projects. Deterioration in our construction portfolio could result in increases in the provision for credit losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our percentage of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. At June 30, 2023, 60.5 of our loans, net, consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans to small and mid-sized businesses, generally located in our primary market area, which are the types of businesses that have a heightened vulnerability to local economic conditions. Over the last ten years, we have increased this type of lending from 57.7 of our portfolio at June 30, 2013, to 60.5 of our portfolio at June 30, 2023, in order to improve the yield on our assets. At June 30, 2023, our loan portfolio included 1.6 billion of commercial real estate loans and 599.0 million of commercial business loans compared to 1.1 billion and 441.6 million, respectively, at June 30, 2022. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one- to four-family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on

 the successful operation and income stream of the borrower s business or the real estate securing the loans as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions. Additionally, commercial loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Commercial loans not collateralized by real estate are often secured by collateral that may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise and fluctuate in value (such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment). Several of our commercial borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or business loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to a single loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a single one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer than for one- to four-family residential property because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Since we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, it may be necessary to increase the level of our allowance for credit losses due to the increased risk characteristics associated with these types of loans. Any increase to our provision credit loan losses would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Any delinquent payments or the failure to repay these loans would hurt our operating results and financial condition. Our loan portfolio possesses risk due to our agricultural lending. Included in the commercial real estate loans described above are agricultural real estate loans totaling 238.1 million, or 6.7 of our loan portfolio, net, at June 30, 2023. Agricultural real estate lending involves a greater degree of risk and typically involves larger loans to single borrowers than lending on one-to-four-family residences. Payments on agricultural real estate loans are dependent on the profitable operation or management of the farm property securing the loan. The success of the farm may be affected by many factors outside the control of the farm borrower, including adverse weather conditions that prevent the planting of a crop or limit crop yields (such as hail, drought and floods), loss of livestock due to disease or other factors, declines in market prices for agricultural products (both domestically and internationally) and the impact of government regulations (including changes in price supports, subsidies, and environmental regulations). In addition, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals whose injury or death may significantly affect the successful operation of the farm. If the cash flow from a farming operation is diminished, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. The primary agricultural activity in our market areas is livestock, dairy, poultry, rice, timber, soybeans, wheat, melons, corn, and cotton. Accordingly, adverse circumstances affecting these activities could have an adverse effect on our agricultural real estate loan portfolio. Our agricultural real estate lending has grown significantly since June 30, 2013 when these loans totaled 53.0 million, or 8.2 of our loan portfolio, and we intend to continue to grow this portion of our loan portfolio. Included in the commercial business loans described above are agricultural production and equipment loans. At June 30, 2023, these loans totaled 138.3 million, or 3.9 , of our loan portfolio, net. As with agricultural real estate loans, the repayment of operating loans is dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property. The same risk applies to agricultural operating loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as farm equipment or assets such as livestock or crops. Any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation to the collateral. Our agricultural operating loans have also grown significantly since June 30, 2013, when such loans totaled 47.4 million, or 7.3 of our loan portfolio. At times, various agricultural commodity prices have been negatively impacted by recent actions taken, or which are feared could be taken, by governments in markets where U.S. agricultural products are exported. Declines in the pricing available to U.S. farmers negatively impacts cash flows for these borrowers to service their debts, and negatively affects the value of real estate and equipment which may be pledged as collateral to secure borrowings. In addition to the various risks to farm operations and management noted above, agricultural loans often are structured for

 annual payments, to coincide with borrower cash flows. As compared to other loan types which generally require monthly payments, an annual payment schedule may increase risk that the Company would not timely identify a borrower experiencing financial difficulties, hindering its ability to work to mitigate losses. Continued growth of our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios may increase the risk of credit defaults in the future. Due to our emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial business lending, a substantial amount of the loans in our commercial real estate and commercial business portfolios and our lending relationships are of relatively recent origin. In general, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as seasoning. A portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans naturally create portfolio churn as loans are originated and repaid. As a result, our portfolio consists of a mix of seasoned and unseasoned loans. We believe that our underwriting practices are sound and based on industry standards and best practices. However, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is relatively new. Therefore, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned, which may be higher than current levels. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We currently exceed thresholds defined in interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentrations, and as such, we may incur additional expense or slow the growth of certain categories of commercial real estate lending. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending (see REGULATION Guidance on Commercial Real Estate Concentrations ). For the purposes of this guidance, commercial real estate includes, among other types, multi-family residential loans and non-owner occupied nonresidential loans, two categories which have been a source of loan growth for the Company. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: total loans for construction land development and other land representing 100 or more of the bank s tier 1 regulatory capital plus the allowance for loan losses includable in total regulatory capital; or total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that exceed 300 of the bank s tier 1 regulatory capital plus the allowance for loan losses includable in total regulatory capital and the bank s commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the prior 36 months. During fiscal 2017, the Bank exceeded the 300 threshold for non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) for the first time as a percentage of tier 1 regulatory capital plus the allowance for credit losses includable in total regulatory capital, peaking at 305 at December 31, 2016. At times since June 30, 2017, the Bank has been below the 300 threshold, and reached a low of 260 of tier 1 regulatory capital plus the allowance for credit losses includable in total regulatory capital at September 30, 2019. However, non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio growth (inclusive of acquisitions) during fiscal years 2022 and 2023 has resulted in the Company reporting 330 of tier 1 regulatory capital plus the allowance for loan losses includable in total regulatory capital at June 30, 2023, as compared to 313 at June 30, 2022. The Bank and Company may see its non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending grow as a percentage of total regulatory capital, or it may slow the growth of this type of lending activity. Should we continue to grow this category of our loan portfolio, we may incur additional expense to meet increasing supervisory expectations related to this lending activity. If we slow the growth of commercial real estate loans generally, or particular concentrations of borrowers or categories of properties within that definition, we may be negatively impacted in terms of our asset growth, net interest margin and earnings, leverage, or other targets.

 Credit losses on investment securities could require charges to earnings, which could negatively impact our results of operations. In assessing the potential credit losses of investment securities, we are required to evaluate instances in which the fair value of particular securities are less than their amortized cost basis. The evaluation considers factors including; past events, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts, and the Company s ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. A qualitative determination is acceptable. We currently hold additional collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) for which credit losses are not currently expected, based on our best judgment using information currently available. Risks Relating to Market Interest Rates Changes in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings and the value of our assets. Our earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See also, Part II, Item 7(a) Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis . We may incur losses on our securities portfolio due to factors beyond our control, including changes in interest rates. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by, or other adverse events affecting the issuer or the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets and lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we did not incur any other-than-temporary impairments on our securities portfolio.

 The replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate may adversely impact us. We have certain loans, investment securities and borrowings indexed to USD LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. ICE Benchmark Administration, the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, ended publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021, and ended publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act was enacted in March 2022 to permit financing agreements that contain a LIBOR-based benchmark without adequate fallback provisions to be automatically replaced by a benchmark recommended by the Federal Reserve. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act that, among other things, identifies the applicable SOFR-based benchmark replacements under the LIBOR Act. SOFR is considered to be a risk-free rate and USD LIBOR was a risk weighted rate. Thus, SOFR tends to be a lower rate than USD LIBOR because SOFR does not contain a risk component. This difference may negatively impact our net interest margin. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers or under our existing borrowings may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We began to use SOFR as a substitute for USD LIBOR for new originations in calendar year 2021. As of June 30, 2023, AFS securities in our portfolio with a face amount of 97.9 million were tied to USD LIBOR. Risks Relating to Liquidity Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or an adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally. Risks Relating to Acquisition Activities We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition activities. The success of our acquisition activities depends on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of the companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the companies or result in decreased revenues from customers. If we are unable to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. We have pursued a strategy of supplementing internal growth by acquiring other financial companies or their assets and liabilities that we believe will help fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, including the following: We may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected;

Table of Contents 
 Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices we considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future; The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into us to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, or at all, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful. To the extent our costs of an acquisition exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired, the acquisition will generate goodwill. We are required to assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually, and any goodwill impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders; and We have completed six acquisitions since June 2017 which enhanced our rate of growth. We do not necessarily expect to be able to maintain our past rate of growth, and may not be able to grow at all in the future. 
 Risks Relating to Future Growth Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we anticipate that our capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations or continued growth, both internally and through acquisitions. Any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock, or otherwise adversely affect your investment. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed, or if the terms will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.

 Risks Relating to Regulation Legislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact us or the businesses in which we are engaged. The financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds, and not to benefit our shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us and our shareholders. Non-compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. Several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations, some of which is expected to increase our costs of operations. We are currently subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC, the Missouri Division of Finance, and the Federal Reserve. The FDIC, the Missouri Division of Finance, and the Federal Reserve govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion, including the ability to restrict an institution s operations, require the institution to reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of the institution s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. See Government Supervision and Regulation. The Federal Reserve and the Missouri Division of Finance regulate the activities in which the Bank may engage primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection or benefit of stockholders. In addition, new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Regulatory changes regarding card interchange fee income do not currently apply to us but could change in the future. Further, legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.

 Risks Relating to Technology and Cyber Security and Other Operational Matters We are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and business. Security breaches in our mobile and consumer and commercial internet banking activities and wealth management or mobile access could expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could damage our reputation and business. We face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cyber-security breaches. We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. The financial services industry has noted recent increases in electronic fraudulent activity, attempted security breaches, and cyber-attacks, including attempts to initiate fraudulent activity through consumer, commercial, and public unit accounts. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for companies, including ours. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cybersecurity breach or other act, however, some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which could increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Our information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption, or security breaches. Information technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.

 There have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial institutions. There have been a number of instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. Although we take protective measures, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information security risks continue to increase due to new technologies, the increasing use of the Internet and telecommunication technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, and others. The Company makes significant investments in various technology to identify and prevent intrusions into its information system. The Company also has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems and performs regular audits using both internal and outside resources. However, there can be no assurances that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. In addition to unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, or other operational disruptions could overwhelm Company websites and prevent the Company from adequately serving customers. Should any of the Company s systems become compromised or customer information be obtained by unauthorized parties, the reputation of the Company could be damaged, relationships with existing customers may be impaired, and the Company could be subject to lawsuits, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company continually encounters technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including the entrance of financial technology companies offering new financial service products. The Company regularly upgrades or replaces core technological systems. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. The Company s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company s operations. Many of the Company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may encounter significant problems or may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products, including the core deposit system, and services, or be successful in marketing the new products and services to its customers. These problems might include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, and technological system failures. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or failure to successfully complete the replacement of the core deposit system, or another core technological system, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company s operations rely on certain external vendors. The Company relies on third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations. For example, the Company outsources a portion of its information systems, communication, data management, and transaction processing to third parties. Accordingly, the Company is exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in the vendor s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, or strategic focus. Such failure to perform could be disruptive to the Company s operations, which could have a materially adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition. These third parties are also sources of risk associated with operational errors, system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If the vendors encounter any of these issues, the Company could be exposed to disruption of service, damage to reputation and litigation. Because the Company is an issuer of debit cards, it is periodically exposed to losses related to security breaches which occur at retailers that are unaffiliated with the

Table of Contents 
 Company (e.g., customer card data being compromised at retail stores). These losses include, but are not limited to, costs and expenses for card reissuance as well as losses resulting from fraudulent card transactions. The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. We cannot assure you that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Significant legal actions could subject us to substantial liabilities. We are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See also, Item 3. Legal Proceedings . Risks Relating to Earnings and Capital from Potential Impairment of Intangible or Deferred Tax Assets Impairment of intangible assets or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized. Should our management determine it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance with a charge to earnings would be reflected in the period. At June 30, 2023, our net deferred tax asset was 12.9 million, none of which was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. Based on the levels of taxable income in prior years and our expectation of profitability in the current year and future years, management has determined that no valuation allowance was required at June 30, 2023. If we are required in the future to take a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset, our financial condition, results of operations and regulatory capital levels would be negatively affected. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. We cannot predict how our common stock will trade in the future. The market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, most of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in this Risk Factors section: actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results;

Table of Contents 
 developments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts; dispositions, acquisitions and financings; actions of our current shareholders, including sales of common stock by existing shareholders and our directors and executive officers; fluctuations in the stock prices and operating results of our competitors; regulatory developments; and other developments in the financial services industry. 
 The market value of our common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock. Currently, market prices of stocks issued by financial institutions have been negatively impacted by interest rates which are at historic lows and anticipated to remain there, and market expectations regarding elevated future credit losses resulting from the economic effects of the pandemic. Regulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common stock. Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., is an entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary bank and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from the Bank. Accordingly, the Company is and will be dependent upon dividends from its subsidiary bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common or preferred stock. Also, the Company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. In addition, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future. If we defer interest payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities or if certain defaults relating to those debt securities occur, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to, our common stock. As of June 30, 2023, we had outstanding 24.3 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by subsidiaries of ours that are statutory business trusts. As of that date, those debt securities were carried at a book value of 23.1 million. We guarantee the trust preferred securities described above. The indentures under which the junior subordinated debt securities were issued, together with the guarantee, prohibit us, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, repurchasing, acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to, any of our capital stock at any time when (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the indenture; (ii) we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the guarantee; or (iii) we have elected to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities. In that regard, we are 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 entitled, at our option but subject to certain conditions, to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities from time to time for up to five years. Events of default under the indentures generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities under certain circumstances, our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debt securities when due, our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation relating to us. As a result of these provisions, if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities, or if any of the other events described in clause (i) or (ii) of the second paragraph of this risk factor were to occur, we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock, from redeeming, repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any of our common stock, and from making any payments to holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock, we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, Missouri law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 of our common stock, the election of directors to staggered terms of three years and not permitting cumulative voting in the election of directors. Our bylaws also contain provisions regarding the timing and content of shareholder proposals and nominations for service on the Board of Directors. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Description of Properties At June 30, 2023, the Bank operated from its headquarters, 62 full-service branch offices, and three limited-service branch offices. The Bank owns the office building and related land in which its headquarters are located, and 58 of its branch offices. The remaining seven branch offices are either leased or partially owned. For additional information regarding our properties, see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5 Premises and Equipment . Management believes that our current facilities are adequate to meet our present and immediately foreseeable needs. However, we will continue to monitor customer growth and expand our branching network, if necessary, to serve our customers needs. Item 3. Legal Proceedings In the opinion of management, the Company and its Bank subsidiary are not parties to any pending claims or lawsuits that are expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or operations. Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Company or the Bank, mainly as defendants, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Company or the Bank holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other activities incident to the Company s or the

 OVERVIEW Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., is a Missouri corporation originally organized for the principal purpose of becoming the holding company of Southern Bank. The principal business of Southern Bank consists of attracting deposits from the communities it serves and investing those funds in loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, as well as commercial business and consumer loans. These funds have also been used to purchase municipal, corporate, and asset-backed investment securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), U.S. government and federal agency obligations and other permissible securities. Southern Bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on the levels of its net interest margin and noninterest income, and its ability to control operating expenses and net charge offs. Net interest margin is dependent primarily on the difference or spread between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets (including loans, mortgage-related securities, and investments) and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities (including deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and borrowings), as well as the relative amounts of these assets and liabilities. Southern Bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or on a varying basis, from its interest-bearing liabilities. Southern Bank s noninterest income consists primarily of fees charged on transaction and loan accounts, interchange income from customer debit and ATM card use, gains on sales of loans, trust and wealth management services, and increased cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance BOLI ). Southern Bank s operating expenses include: employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and data processing expenses, legal and professional fees, federal deposit insurance premiums, amortization of intangible assets, and other general and administrative expenses. Southern Bank s operations are significantly influenced by general economic conditions including monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve Board. Additionally, Southern Bank is subject to policies and regulations issued by financial institution regulatory agencies including the Federal Reserve, the Missouri Division of Finance, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Each of these factors may influence interest rates, loan demand, prepayment rates and deposit flows. Interest rates available on competing investments as well as general market interest rates influence the Bank s cost of funds. Lending activities are affected by the demand for real estate and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. Lending activities are funded through the attraction of deposit accounts consisting of checking accounts, passbook and statement savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, certificate of deposit accounts with terms of 60 months or less, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, and brokered deposits. The Bank intends to continue to focus on its lending programs for one- to four-family and multi-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer financing on loans secured by properties or collateral located in its primary lending area or to borrowers who operate within that area. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. provide qualitative and quantitative information necessary to understand the estimation uncertainty and the impact the critical accounting estimate has had or is reasonably likely to have on financial condition or results of operations to the extent the information is material and reasonably available. this information should include why each critical accounting estimate is subject to uncertainty and, to the extent the information is material and reasonably available, how much each estimate and/or assumption has changed over a relevant period, and sensitivity of the reported amount to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying its calculation.

Table of Contents 
 The Company has established various accounting policies, which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in the preparation of our financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8 of this Form 10-K under the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company. Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company s allowance for credit losses is its estimate of credit losses expected in the loan portfolio, on unfunded lending commitments, or in its available-for-sale securities portfolio over the expected life of those assets. While these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining the required allowance, actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results, especially when determining required allowances for larger, complex commercial credits or unfunded lending commitments to commercial borrowers. Consumer loans, including single family residential real estate, are individually smaller and generally behave in a similar manner, and loss estimates for these credits are considered more predictable. Additionally, the Company estimates the allowance for credit losses as a calculation of expected lifetime credit losses utilizing a forward-looking forecast of macroeconomic conditions, which may differ significantly from actual results. Further discussion of the methodology used in establishing the allowance is provided in Note 1 and Note 3 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and in the Financial Condition Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses sections of this Item 7. FINANCIAL CONDITION General. The Company experienced balance sheet growth in fiscal 2023, with total assets of 4.4 billion at June 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of 1.1 billion, or 35.6 , as compared to June 30, 2022. Asset growth was attributable in large part to the Citizens merger and was comprised mainly of increases in loans and available-for-sale AFS securities. Cash and equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were 55.2 million at June 30, 2023, a decrease of 36.3 million, or 39.7 , as compared to June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily a result of organic loan growth outpacing organic deposit growth during the period, partially offset by the net effects of the Citizens merger. Interest-bearing time deposits were 1.2 million at June 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.5 million, or 74.0 as compared to June 30, 2022. Investments. Available-for-sale (AFS) securities were 417.6 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of 182.2 million, or 77.4 , as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the Citizens merger, and reflected increased holdings of CMOs, asset-backed securities, corporate obligations, and residential MBS. Loans. Loans, net of the ACL, were 3.6 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of 884.9 million, or 32.9 , as compared to June 30, 2022. Gross loans increased by 899.5 million, while the ACL attributable to outstanding loan balances increased 14.6 million, or 44.1 , as compared to June 30, 2022. An increase of 447.4 million in loan balances, net of fair value adjustments, was attributable to the Citizens merger. The Company also noted legacy growth in residential and commercial real estate loans, drawn construction loan balances, commercial loans, and a modest contribution from consumer loans. Residential real estate loan balances increased primarily due to growth in multi-family loans. Commercial real estate balances increased primarily from an increase in loans secured by nonresidential structures, along with growth in loans secured by farmland, and unimproved land. Construction loan balances increased primarily due to increases in drawn balances of nonowner-occupied nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans. The increase in commercial loans was attributable to commercial and industrial loans and agricultural loan balances.

 Nonperforming loans were 7.7 million, or 0.21 of gross loans, at June 30, 2023, as compared to 4.1 million, or 0.15 of gross loans at June 30, 2022. The increase in nonperforming loans as compared to the prior fiscal year was attributed primarily to 2.0 million in nonperforming loans obtained via the Citizens merger and an increase of 1.5 million in legacy nonperforming loans. Allowance for Credit Losses. Our ACL at June 30, 2023, totaled 47.8 million, representing 1.32 of gross loans and 624.9 of nonperforming loans, as compared to 33.2 million, representing 1.22 of gross loans and 806.2 of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2022. The ACL required for purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans acquired in the Citizens merger was 1.1 million, and was funded through purchase accounting adjustments, while the ACL required for non-PCD loans acquired in the Citizens merger was 5.2 million, and was funded through a charge to PCL recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. See also, Provision for Credit Losses, under Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 . The Company regularly reviews its ACL and makes adjustments to its balance based on management s estimate of (1) the total expected losses included in the Company s financial assets held at amortized cost, which is limited to the Company s loan portfolio, and (2) any credit deterioration in the Company s available-for-sale securities as of the balance sheet date. The Company holds no securities classified as held-to-maturity. Although the Company maintains its ACL at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the ACL is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the Company to record additional allowances. The required ACL has been estimated based upon the guidelines in ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. For a summary of changes in the ACL during the current and prior fiscal years, and a breakdown of the ACL by loan category as of the current and prior fiscal year end, see Description of Business Asset Quality, Allowance for Credit Losses, contained within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. The estimate involves consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the loans as segmented by the Company, and is based on an evaluation, at the reporting date, of historical loss experience and peer data, coupled with qualitative adjustments to address current economic conditions and credit quality, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Specific qualitative factors considered include, but may not be limited to: Changes in lending policies and/or loan review system National, regional, and local economic trends and/or conditions Changes and/or trends in the nature, volume, or terms of the loan portfolio Experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff Levels and/or trends of delinquent, non-accrual, problem assets, or charge offs and recoveries Concentrations of credit Changes in collateral values Agricultural economic conditions Risks from regulatory, legal, or competitive factors Premises and Equipment. Premises and equipment increased to 92.4 million, up 21.1 million, or 29.5 , as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to premises and right-of-use assets acquired in the Citizens merger, partially offset by the sale of some properties not being utilized as Bank facilities. BOLI. The Bank has purchased key person life insurance policies (BOLI) on employees at various times since fiscal 2003, and has acquired additional BOLI in connection with certain mergers. At June 30, 2023, the cash surrender value of all such policies was 71.7 million, up 23.0 million, or 47.2 , as compared to June 30, 2022, attributable primarily to the Citizens merger. Intangible Assets. The July 2009 acquisition of the Southern Bank of Commerce resulted in goodwill of 126,000. The October 2013 acquisition of Ozarks Legacy Community Financial, Inc., resulted in goodwill of 1.5 million. The August 2014 acquisition of Peoples Service Company, Inc., and its subsidiary, Peoples Bank of the Ozarks (the Peoples Acquisition resulted in goodwill of 3.0 million. The June 2017 acquisition of Tammcorp, Inc., and its

 subsidiary, Capaha Bank (the Capaha Acquisition resulted in goodwill of 4.1 million and a 3.4 million core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a seven-year period using the straight-line method. The SMB-Marshfield Acquisition resulted in goodwill of 4.4 million and a 1.3 million core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a seven-year period using the straight-line method. The Gideon Acquisition resulted in goodwill of 1.0 million and a 4.1 million core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a seven-year period using the straight-line method. The May 2020 Central Federal Acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of 123,000 and a 540,000 core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a six-year period using the straight-line method. The December 2021 Cairo acquisition resulted in goodwill of 442,000 and a 168,000 core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a seven-year period using the straight-line method. The February 2022 Fortune acquisition resulted in goodwill of 12.8 million and a 1.6 million core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a seven-year period using the straight-line method. The January 2023 Citizens merger resulted in goodwill of 23.5 million, as well as a 22.1 million core deposit intangible which is being amortized over a ten year period using the straight-line method, and a 2.6 million intangible related to the acquired trust and wealth management business line which is being amortized over a ten year period using the straight-line method. Goodwill from these acquisitions is not being amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually. Deposits. Deposits were 3.7 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of 910.5 million, or 32.3 , as compared to June 30, 2022. An increase of 851.1 million in deposit balances, net of fair value adjustments, was attributable to the Citizens merger. Inclusive of the merger, the deposit portfolio saw fiscal year-to-date increases in certificates of deposit, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market deposit accounts, and noninterest bearing transaction accounts. Public unit balances totaled 578.5 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of 105.3 million compared to June 30, 2022. Brokered deposits totaled 159.6 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of 136.7 million compared to June 30, 2022. Our discussion of brokered deposits excludes those deposits originated through reciprocal arrangements. We continued to utilize reciprocal deposit programs, and at June 30, 2023, we had placed deposits of 524.1 million through reciprocal programs, up from 387.9 million a year earlier. At June 30, 2023, 331.3 million of this total reflected deposits we had placed on behalf of our public unit depositors, up from 278.0 million a year ago. The loan-to-deposit ratio for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was 95.8 , as compared to 94.3 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Borrowings. FHLB advances were 133.5 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of 95.6 million, or 251.8 , as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase in FHLB advances resulted from organic loan growth outpacing organic deposit growth, partially offset by the net effects of the Citizens merger, and was inclusive of 62.1 million in term advances and 33.5 million in overnight borrowings, as compared to no overnight borrowings at June 30, 2022. Subordinated Debt. In March 2004, 7.0 million of Floating Rate Capital Securities of Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I, with a liquidation value of 1,000 per share were issued. The securities bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2034. In connection with its October 2013 acquisition of Ozarks Legacy, the Company assumed 3.1 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in June 2005 by Ozarks Legacy in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. The carrying value of these debt securities was approximately 2.7 million at June 30, 2023, relatively unchanged as compared to June 30, 2022. In connection with the Peoples Acquisition, the Company assumed 6.5 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in 2005 by Peoples, in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. The carrying value of these debt securities was approximately 5.5 million at June 30, 2023, as compared to 5.4 million at June 30, 2022. In connection with the Fortune acquisition, the Company assumed 7.5 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes had been issued in May 2021 by Fortune to a multi-lender group, bear interest through May 2026 at a fixed rate of 4.5 , and will bear interest thereafter at SOFR plus 3.77 . The notes will be redeemable at par beginning in May 2026, and mature in May 2031. The carrying value of the notes was approximately 7.7 million at June 30, 2023, relatively unchanged as compared to June 30, 2022.

 Stockholders Equity. The Company s stockholders equity was 446.1 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of 125.3 million, or 39.1 , as compared to June 30, 2022. The increase was attributable primarily to 98.3 million in equity issued to Citizens shareholders, as well as to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, partially offset by a 4.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss as the market value of the Company s investments declined due to increases in market interest rates. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022 Net Income. The Company s net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, was 39.2 million, a decrease of 7.9 million, or 16.8 , as compared to the prior fiscal year. Net Interest Income . Net interest income for fiscal 2023 was 126.7 million, an increase of 23.2 million, or 22.4 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase, as compared to the prior fiscal year, was attributable to a 28.5 increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin, from 3.72 to 3.54 . Average earning asset balance growth was due primarily to loan growth and increases in investment securities, attributable in part to the Citizens merger. Lower average cash and cash equivalent balances partially offset increases in other categories of average earning assets, and the change in the interest-earning asset mix also partially offset the decline in interest margin. Interest Income. Interest income for fiscal 2023 was 176.4 million, an increase of 59.5 million, or 51.0 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to an increase of 794.0 million, or 28.5 , in the average balance of interest-earning assets, combined with a 73 basis point increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, from 4.20 in fiscal 2022, to 4.93 in fiscal 2023. Interest income on loans receivable for fiscal 2023 was 162.2 million, an increase of 50.7 million, or 45.5 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to a 749.9 million, or 30.9 , increase in the average balance of loans receivable, combined with a 51 basis point increase in the average yield earned on loans receivable. The increase in the average yield was attributed to origination and repricing of loans and borrower refinancing as average market interest rates increased over the course of the fiscal year, combined with the partial-year impact of the Citizens merger, in which the acquired loan portfolio was valued based on current market interest rates at the date of merger. Interest income on the investment portfolio and other interest-earning assets was 14.2 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 8.8 million, or 164.2 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was attributable to a 203-basis point increase in the yield on these assets, combined with a 44.1 million, or 12.3 , increase in the average balance of such assets. The increase in average yield was attributable to the partial-year impact of the Citizens merger, in which the acquired securities portfolio was valued based on current market interest rates at the date of merger, a change in the mix of such assets, as cash and cash equivalents decreased while investment and mortgage backed securities increased, and purchases and reinvestment at market interest rates which were increasing over the course of the fiscal year. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 49.7 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 36.4 million, or 273.5 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to a 113-basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, to 1.72 in fiscal 2023, from 0.59 in fiscal 2022, combined with an increase of 654.0 million, or 29.2 , in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. Interest expense on deposits was 44.4 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 32.6 million, or 275.5 , as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to a 107-basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, combined with the 580.5 million, or 26.6 , increase in the average balance of those deposits. The increase in the average rate paid on deposits was attributable primarily to higher market interest rates over the course of fiscal 2023.

 Interest expense on FHLB advances was 3.6 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 2.8 million, or 358.0 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due primarily to a 64.3 million, or 148.0 , increase in the average balance of these advances, combined with a 154-basis point increase in the average rate paid on advances. The increase in the average rate paid was attributable primarily to higher market interest rates over the course of the fiscal year, which impacted the costs of overnight borrowings and new term advances taken during the fiscal year. Interest expense on subordinated debt was 1.4 million for fiscal year 2023, an increase of 753,000, or 109.8 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due primarily to a 242-basis point increase in the average rate paid on subordinated debt, combined with a 5.1 million, or 27.8 , increase in the average balance of subordinated debt. The increase in the average rate paid was attributable primarily to higher market interest rates over the course of the fiscal year, which impacted adjustable rate debt, while the increase in the average balance was attributable primarily to the mid-fiscal 2022 assumption of subordinated debt in the Fortune merger. Provision for Credit Losses . The Company recorded a provision for credit losses (PCL) of 17.1 million for fiscal 2023, as compared to a PCL of 1.5 million for the prior fiscal year. In the current period, the PCL was attributable in part to the 5.2 million charge required to fund the ACL for non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired in the Citizens merger, along with a 1.8 million charge to fund to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures acquired in the Citizens merger. Exclusive of the charges required as a result of the Citizens merger, the Company would have recorded a PCL of approximately 10.1 million in the current year, reflecting an 9.0 million increase in the Company s required ACL on outstanding loan balances based on organic loan growth and changes in the current expected credit losses on the portfolio, and a 1.1 million increase in the required allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure based on increased anticipated draws of available credit and changes in the mix of loan types anticipated to be funded. Our ACL at June 30, 2023, totaled 47.8 million, representing 1.32 of gross loans and 634 of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of 33.2 million, representing 1.22 of gross loans and 806 of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2022. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of 0.02 during fiscal year 2023, as compared to net charge offs of less than one basis point in the prior fiscal year. (See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Critical Accounting Policies and Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses in this Item 7, and Asset Quality in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.) Noninterest Income. Noninterest income was 26.2 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 5.0 million, or 23.6 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. Increases in deposit service charges, bank card interchange income, income on non-deposit investment products, loan servicing fees, other loan fees, and earnings on BOLI contributed to the year-over year increase, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sale of residential loans originated for sale into the secondary market. Most categories of noninterest income increased due to the impact of the January 2023 Citizens merger and the February 2022 Fortune merger. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was 86.4 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of 23.0 million, or 36.4 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase included 4.9 million in charges related to merger and acquisition activity, which was primarily attributable to legal and professional fees, data processing and telecommunications, and team member compensation and expenses. In total, the increase in noninterest expense was attributable primarily to compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, amortization of intangibles, deposit insurance premiums, and other noninterest expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits as compared to the prior year period primarily reflected increased headcount for part of the fiscal year resulting from recent merger activity, compensation adjustments over the prior year, one-time compensation attributable to the Citizens merger, and a continued trend of increasing legacy employee headcount. Compensation adjustments over the last several fiscal years have exceeded historical trends. Data processing expenses increased primarily as a result of data conversion charges associated with the Citizens merger, and also reflected continued investments in new software and systems. Occupancy expenses increased primarily due to facilities added through the Citizens merger. Other noninterest expenses increased due to miscellaneous acquisition-related expenses, expenses related to loan originations, and expenses related to employee travel and training.

 Provision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 10.2 million for fiscal 2023, a decrease of 2.5 million, or 19.7 , as compared to the prior fiscal year, which was attributable to lower pre-tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate to 20.7 for fiscal 2023, as compared to 21.3 for fiscal 2022. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND 2021 Net Income. The Company s net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, was 47.2 million, roughly unchanged as compared to the prior fiscal year. Net Interest Income . Net interest income for fiscal 2022 was 103.6 million, an increase of 10.9 million, or 11.7 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase, as compared to the prior fiscal year, was attributable to a 13.1 increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin, from 3.77 to 3.72 . Average earning asset balance growth was due primarily to loan growth and increases in investment securities, as well as the effect of the Fortune acquisition. Additionally, significantly higher average cash and cash equivalent balances contributed to the increase in average earning assets, but reduced the Company s net interest margin. Interest Income. Interest income for fiscal 2022 was 116.9 million, an increase of 7.4 million, or 6.8 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to an increase of 322.9 million, or 13.1 , in the average balance of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets, from 4.45 in fiscal 2021, to 4.20 in fiscal 2022. Interest income on loans receivable for fiscal 2022 was 111.5 million, an increase of 6.4 million, or 6.1 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to a 254.8 million increase in the average balance of loans receivable, partially offset by a 24 basis point decrease in the average yield earned on loans receivable. The decrease in the average yield was attributed primarily to origination and repricing of loans and borrower refinancing as average market interest rates decreased significantly compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest income on the investment portfolio and other interest-earning assets was 5.4 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 974,000, or 22.2 , when compared to the prior fiscal year, attributable to a 23.4 increase in the average balance of such assets, partially offset by a two basis point decrease in the yield on these assets. The decrease in average yield was attributable to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in yield on debt securities, partially offset by an increase in the average balance and yield on mortgage-backed securities. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 13.3 million for fiscal 2022, a decrease of 3.5 million, or 20.8 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was due to a 25 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, from 0.84 in fiscal 2021, to 0.59 in fiscal 2022, partially offset by an increase of 234.0 million, or 11.7 , in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. Interest expense on deposits was 11.8 million for fiscal 2022, a decrease of 3.1 million, or 20.6 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was due to a 23 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the 253.5 million increase in the average balance of those deposits. The decrease in the average rate paid on deposits was attributable primarily to lower market interest rates over the course of fiscal 2022, as compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest expense on FHLB advances was 792,000 million for fiscal 2022, a decrease of 574,000, or 42.0 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was due to a 22.5 million decrease in the average balance of these advances, combined with a 24 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on advances. The decrease in the average rate paid was attributable primarily to the maturity of advances that had carried higher rates, combined with the assumption of advances at lower rates in the Fortune acquisition.

 Provision for Credit Losses . The Company recorded a provision for credit losses (PCL) of 1.5 million for fiscal 2022, as compared to a negative PCL of 1.0 million for the prior fiscal year. In the current period, the PCL was attributable to the 1.9 million charge required to fund the ACL for purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans acquired in the Fortune acquisition, along with a charge of 120,000 to fund to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures acquired in the Fortune acquisition. Exclusive of the charges required as a result of the Fortune acquisition, the Company would have recorded a negative PCL of approximately 533,000 in the current year, reflecting a decrease in the Company s required ACL on outstanding loan balances, partially offset by an increase in the required allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Negative provisioning, exclusive of the impact of the Fortune acquisition, in the year ended June 30, 2022, was attributed primarily to an improved outlook regarding the economic environment resulting as the economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company notes less uncertainty regarding the potential adverse impact on its borrowers, generally low and consistent levels of net charge offs, and a reduction in delinquent or adversely classified credits, and nonperforming loans. While the Company assesses that the economic outlook has continued to improve during the current year as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, there remains significant uncertainty as economic activity recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Federal Reserve withdraws accommodative monetary policy that was put into effect to respond to the pandemic and its economic impact. In the prior period, the negative PCL was due both to a 602,000 reduction in the Company s required ACL on outstanding loan balances, as well as a 422,000 reduction in the Company s required allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure. Our ACL at June 30, 2022, totaled 33.2 million, representing 1.22 of gross loans and 806 of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of 33.2 million, representing 1.49 of gross loans and 566 of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2021. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of less than one basis point during fiscal year 2022, as compared to net charge offs of 0.04 in the prior fiscal year. (See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Critical Accounting Policies and Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses in this Item 7, and Asset Quality in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.) Noninterest Income. Noninterest income was 21.2 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 1.2 million, or 5.8 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. Deposit service charge income, loan fees, nondeposit investment products, gains on the sale of the guaranty portion of newly originated government-guaranteed loans, and other income contributed to the year-over year increase, partially offset by a decrease in gains on sale of residential loans originated into the secondary market, loan servicing income, and earnings on bank-owned life insurance (BOLI). Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense was 63.4 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 9.3 million, or 17.3 , when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase included 1.4 million in charges related to merger and acquisition activity, which was primarily attributable to data processing, compensation, and legal fees. In total, the increase in noninterest expense was attributable primarily to compensation and benefits, occupancy expenses, data processing expenses, and other noninterest expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits as compared to the prior year period primarily reflected compensation adjustments over the prior year, one-time compensation attributable to the Fortune acquisition, increased headcount for part of the fiscal year resulting from the acquisition, and a modest trend increase in legacy employee headcount. Compensation adjustments which took effect in January 2022 were, as expected, above historical trends. Data processing expenses increased primarily as a result of data conversion charges associated with the Fortune acquisition. Occupancy expenses increased due to remodeled and relocated facilities, facilities added through the Fortune acquisition, a de novo facility, new ATM and ITM installations and other equipment purchases, and charges for maintenance of facilities and grounds. Other noninterest expenses increased due to miscellaneous acquisition-related expenses, expenses related to loan originations, and expenses related to employee travel and training. Provision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision of 12.7 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 210,000, or 1.7 , as compared to the prior fiscal year, attributable to higher pre-tax income, and an increase in the effective tax rate to 21.3 for fiscal 2022, as compared to 21.0 for fiscal 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Southern Missouri s primary potential sources of funds include deposit growth, FHLB advances, amortization and prepayment of loan principal, investment maturities and sales, and capital generated from ongoing operations. While

Table of Contents 
 scheduled repayments on loans and securities as well as the maturity of short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funding, deposit flows, FHLB advance redemptions and loan and security prepayment rates are significantly influenced by factors outside of the Bank s control, including general economic conditions and market competition. The Bank has relied on FHLB advances as a source for funding cash or liquidity needs. Southern Missouri uses its liquid assets as well as other funding sources to meet ongoing commitments, to fund loan demand, to repay maturing certificates of deposit and FHLB advances, to make investments, to fund other deposit withdrawals and to meet operating expenses. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had outstanding commitments to extend credit of 912.0 million (including 552.1 million in unused lines of credit). Total commitments to originate fixed-rate loans with terms in excess of one year were 213.3 million at rates ranging from 3.95 to 11.0 , with a weighted-average rate of 6.07 . Management anticipates that current funding sources will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, Southern Missouri increased deposits by 910.5 million, and increased FHLB advances by 95.6 million. During the prior fiscal year, Southern Missouri increased deposits by 484.3 million and decreased FHLB advances by 19.6 million. At June 30, 2023, the Bank reported 1.1 billion of its single-family residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios as eligible collateral to the FHLB for available credit of approximately 675.7 million, of which 133.7 million was advanced, while 417,000 was encumbered in relation to residential real estate loans sold onto the secondary market through the FHLB, and 305,000 was utilized for the issuance of letters of credit to secure public unit deposits. The Bank had also pledged 344.3 million of its agricultural real estate and agricultural operating and equipment loans to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis s discount window for available credit of approximately 276.6 million, as of June 30, 2023, none of which was advanced. The Bank has also been approved for participation in the BTFP introduced early in calendar year 2023 by the Federal Reserve Bank, but the Bank has not pledged any securities under the program. In addition, the Bank has the ability to identify eligible loans within several of its other loan portfolios, including, for example, its multi-family residential real estate, home equity, or commercial business loans, for additional credit availability with the FHLB. In total, FHLB borrowings are limited to 45 of Bank assets, or approximately 1.9 billion as most recently reported by the FHLB as of June 30, 2023, which means that an amount up to 1.8 billion may still be eligible to be borrowed from the FHLB, subject to available collateral. Along with the ability to borrow from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, management believes its liquid resources will be sufficient to meet the Company s liquidity needs. Liquidity management is an ongoing responsibility of the Bank s management. The Bank adjusts its investment in liquid assets based upon a variety of factors including (i) expected loan demand and deposit flows, (ii) anticipated investment and FHLB advance maturities, (iii) the impact on profitability, and (iv) asset/liability management objectives. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 690.5 million in CDs maturing within one year and 2.7 billion in other deposits without a specified maturity, as compared to 377.8 million in CDs maturing within one year and 2.2 billion in other deposits without a specified maturity as of June 30, 2022. Management believes that most maturing interest-bearing liabilities will be retained or replaced by new interest-bearing liabilities. Also, at June 30, 2023, the Bank had 33.5 million in overnight advances from the FHLB, 13.0 million in term FHLB advances maturing within one year, and 87.0 million in FHLB advances with a maturity date in excess of one year. Of the advances with maturity dates in excess of one year, none was eligible for early redemption by the lender within one year. We also incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. At June 30, 2023, we had other future obligations and accrued expenses of 18.6 million. Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2024 we project expending approximately 6.0 million to 8.0 million of cash for capital investment in technology, property, plant and equipment. In addition, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, we project that our fixed commitments will include (i) 1.0 million of operating and

 finance lease and other fixed payments and (ii) 1.7 million of scheduled interest payments on subordinate notes. We believe that our liquid assets combined with the available lines of credit provide adequate liquidity to meet our current financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. REGULATORY CAPITAL Federally insured financial institutions are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Federal Reserve regulations establish capital requirements, including a tier 1 leverage (or core capital) requirement and risk-based capital requirements. The Federal Reserve Board is also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. At June 30, 2023, the Bank exceeded regulatory capital requirements with tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and tangible common equity capital of 407.8 million, 454.7 million and 407.8 million, respectively. The Bank s tier 1 capital represented 9.54 of total adjusted assets and 10.56 of total risk-weighted assets, while total risk-based capital was 11.77 of total risk-weighted assets, and tangible common equity capital was 10.56 of total risk-weighted assets. To be considered adequately capitalized, the Bank must maintain tier 1 leverage capital levels of at least 4.0 of adjusted total assets and 6.0 of risk-weighted assets, total risk-based capital of 8.0 of risk-weighted assets, and tangible common equity capital of 4.5 of risk-weighted assets. To be considered well capitalized, the Bank must maintain tier 1 leverage capital levels of at least 5.0 of adjusted total assets and 8.0 of risk-weighted assets, total risk-based capital of 10.0 of risk-weighted assets, and tangible common equity capital of 6.5 of risk-weighted assets. At June 30, 2023, the Company exceeded regulatory capital requirements with tier 1 leverage, total risk-based capital, and tangible common equity capital of 426.6 million, 481.2 million and 411.2 million, respectively. The Company s tier 1 capital represented 9.95 of total adjusted assets and 11.10 of total risk-weighted assets, while total risk-based capital was 12.52 of total risk-weighted assets, and tangible common equity capital was 10.70 of total risk-weighted assets. To be considered adequately capitalized, the Company must maintain tier 1 leverage capital levels of at least 4.0 of adjusted total assets and 6.0 of risk-weighted assets, total risk-based capital of 8.0 of risk-weighted assets, and tangible common equity capital of 4.5 of risk weighted assets. See Item 1 Business Regulation, and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional detail on the Company s capital requirements. IMPACT OF INFLATION The consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In the current interest rate environment, liquidity and maturity structure of the Company s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. AVERAGE BALANCE, INTEREST AND AVERAGE YIELDS AND RATES The following table sets forth certain information relating to the Company s average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and reflects the average yield on assets and the average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. These yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the years indicated. Nonaccrual loans are included with other noninterest-earning assets.

Table of Contents 
 The table also presents information with respect to the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, which financial institutions have traditionally used as an indicator of profitability. Another indicator of an institution s net interest income is its net yield (or net interest margin) on interest-earning assets, which is its net interest income divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. Net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread and by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The goal of the Company s asset/liability management strategy is to manage the interest rate sensitivity of both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in order to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk. The Company employs various strategies intended to manage the potential effect that changing interest rates may have on future operating results. The primary asset/liability management strategy has been to focus on matching the anticipated repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. At times, however, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Company may increase its interest rate risk position in order to maintain its net interest margin. In an effort to manage the interest rate risk resulting from fixed rate lending, the Company has at times utilized longer term (up to 10 year maturities), fixed-rate FHLB advances, which may be subject to early redemption, to offset interest rate risk. Other elements of the Company s current asset/liability strategy include: (i) increasing originations of commercial real estate, commercial business loans, agricultural real estate, and agricultural operating lines, which typically provide higher yields and shorter repricing periods, but inherently increase credit risk, (ii) limiting the price volatility of the investment portfolio by maintaining a relatively short weighted average maturity, (iii) actively soliciting less rate-sensitive nonmaturity deposits, and (iv) offering competitively priced money market accounts and CDs with maturities of up to five years. The degree to which each segment of the strategy is achieved will affect profitability and exposure to interest rate risk.

 The Company continues to generate long-term, fixed-rate residential loans. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, fixed rate residential loan originations totaled 147.2 million (of which 21.5 million was originated for sale into the secondary market), compared to 269.9 million during the prior year (of which 43.2 million was originated for sale into the secondary market). At June 30, 2023, the fixed-rate, single-family residential loan portfolio totaled 586.4 million, with a weighted average maturity of 188 months, compared to 499.2 million with a weighted average maturity of 183 months at June 30, 2022. The Company originated 38.4 million in adjustable rate residential loans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 14.9 million during the prior fiscal year. At June 30, 2023, fixed rate loans with remaining maturities in excess of 10 years totaled 365.1 million, or 10.2 , of loans receivable, compared to 338.1 million, or 15.4 , of loans receivable, at June 30, 2022. The Company originated 614.2 million in fixed rate commercial, commercial real estate, and multi-family loans during the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 580.0 million during the prior fiscal year. The Company also originated 157.0 million in adjustable rate commercial, commercial real estate, and multi-family loans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 64.2 million during the prior fiscal year. At June 30, 2023, adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit totaled 64.6 million, compared to 45.4 million as of June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, the Company s weighted average life of its investment portfolio was 5.3 years, compared to 5.2 years at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, CDs with original terms of two years or more totaled 383.8 million, compared to 321.5 million at June 30, 2022. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The following table sets forth as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, management s estimates of the projected changes in net portfolio value in the event of 100, 200, and 300 basis point, instantaneous and permanent increases or decreases in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates and are based on an internally generated model using the actual maturity and repricing schedules for Southern Bank s loans and deposits, adjusted by management s assumptions for prepayment rates and deposit runoff. Further, the computations do not consider any reactions that the Bank may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. These projected changes should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in any of the aforementioned interest rate changes. Management cannot accurately predict future interest rates or their effect on the Company s NPV and net interest income in the future. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of NPV. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, most of Southern Bank s loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the foregoing table. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.

The Company s interest rate sensitivity has increased over the recent period as a result of these originations and due to the behavior of fixed-rate borrowers in a higher interest rate environment, but this increased sensitivity was partially offset by the fiscal 2023 Citizens merger, as the acquired balance sheet included a higher percentage of rate sensitive assets. The Company has worked to limit its exposure to rising rates by (a) increasing the share of funding on its balance sheet obtained from non-maturity transaction accounts, (b) limiting short-term FHLB borrowings and (c) limiting the duration of its available-for-sale investment portfolio.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Allowances for Credit Losses The Company s loan portfolio totaled 3.6 billion as of June 30, 2023 and the associated allowance for credit losses on loans was 47.8 million. The Company s unfunded loan commitments totaled 757.7 million, with an associated allowance for credit loss of 6.3 million. Together these amounts represent the allowances for credit losses ACL ). As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses related to loans is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses related to unfunded commitments is a liability account and is included in other liabilities. The amount of each allowance account represented management s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering all relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, loans were segmented into pools based upon similar risk characteristics. For each of these loan pools, management measured expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing either a remaining life model or a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The remaining life model used historical internal and peer loss rates applied to the estimated remaining life of each pool. For the DCF model, management generates cash flow projections at the instrument level adjusting payment expectations for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default and loss given default. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers while modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. The Company s analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers. The models were adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the forecasted macroeconomic variables were reverted to their historical mean utilizing a rational, systematic basis. Additional qualitative adjustments are applied for risk factors that are not considered within the modeling process but are relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis, which may be based on the fair value of the collateral or a discounted cash flow model of expected cash flows. For unfunded commitments, the Company applies expected funding percentages to the respective model loss rates based on similar risk characteristics to estimate the allowance for credit losses. Auditing management s estimate of the ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments involves a high degree of subjectivity due to the complexities of the key assumptions used, such as applicable loss drivers for collectively evaluated segments of the loan portfolio and the timing and amount of cash flows for individually analyzed loans. Management s identification and measurement of the qualitative factor adjustments is highly judgmental and had a significant effect on the ACL. There was a high degree of auditor judgment involved, due to the significant judgments made by management related to significant assumptions used and related uncertainty in determining the ACL. Therefore, there was an increased level of audit effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate ACL.

 o Loan data completeness and accuracy o Grouping of loans based on similar risk characteristics o Use of historical internal data and external peer data o Model inputs utilized o Approval of model assumptions selected o Establishment of qualitative factors o Loan risk ratings 
 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of the ACL Performed reviews of individual credit files and internally prepared loan review reports and support to evaluate the reasonableness of loan credit risk ratings Tested the completeness and accuracy, including the evaluation of the relevance and reliability, of inputs utilized in the calculation of the ACL Evaluated the reasonableness of selected loss drivers utilized and loss driver forecasts for loan segments Tested the reasonableness of specific allowances on individually reviewed loans Tested the reasonableness of the peer group utilized for inclusion with the selected loss drivers Evaluated analytically credit quality trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, charge-offs and loan risk ratings Evaluated the overall reasonableness of the ACL considering trends identified within peer groups Tested significant assumptions used in the estimation of the ACL of unfunded loan commitments Evaluated qualitative adjustments made to the ACL, including assessing the reasonableness and basis for those adjustments in estimating the ACL Tested management s estimate surrounding the initial ACL impact of the Citizens Bancshares, Co. business combination, including assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of the assumptions included as part of the estimate 
 Business Combination Description of the Matter As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed an acquisition with a bank holding company during the year ended June 30, 2023, resulting in the expansion of the Company s operating footprint and additional goodwill of approximately 23 million being recognized on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Management determined that the acquisition qualified as a business combination. Accordingly, all

 identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were valued at fair value as part of the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date. The identification and valuation of such acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment and consider the use of outside vendors to estimate the fair value allocations. We identified the acquisition and the related valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as a critical audit matter. Auditing the acquired net assets and acquisition-related considerations involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s operational assumptions of the acquisitions, fair value estimates, purchase price allocations, and assessing the appropriateness of management s valuation models. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address the accounting for the business combinations included: Obtained and reviewed the executed Agreement and Plan of Merger document to gain an understanding of the underlying terms of the completed acquisition Obtained and reviewed management s business combination memo to gain an understanding of the procedures performed to identify and calculate the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities Tested management s business combination accounting analysis, focusing on the completeness and accuracy of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related fair value purchase price allocation Obtained valuation estimates related to the core deposit intangible, wealth management intangible, and loan fair value prepared by the Company s external valuation specialists and challenged management s analysis of the appropriateness of the valuations allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed; including but not limited to, testing of critical inputs, assumptions applied, and valuation models utilized Utilized FORVIS s internal valuation specialists to assist with evaluating the related fair value purchase price allocations made to certain identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed Tested the goodwill calculation resulting from the completed acquisition, which is the difference between the total net consideration paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired Evaluated the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements /sig/ FORVIS, LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2002.

 pools, which are homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics. The Company primarily utilizes the discounted cash flow DCF methodology for measurement of the required ACL. For a limited number of pools with a relatively small balance of unpaid principal balance, the Company utilized the remaining life method. The DCF model implements probability of default PD and loss given default LGD calculations at the instrument level. PD and LGD are determined based on a regression analysis and correlation of historical losses with various economic factors over time. In general, the Company s losses have not correlated well with economic factors, and the Company has utilized peer data where more appropriate. The Company defines a default as an event of charge off, an adverse (substandard or worse) internal credit rating, becoming delinquent 90 days or more, or being placed on nonaccrual status. A PD/LGD estimate is applied to a projected model of the loan s cashflow,

The Company also recorded an adjustment to the reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities of . The impact at adoption was reflected as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings, net of income taxes, in the amount of million. In accordance with the new standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 in fiscal 2021 could also impact the Company s future earnings, perhaps materially. The following table illustrates the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13: Allowance for credit losses on loans: Real Estate Loans: Residential Construction ) Commercial Consumer loans Commercial loans Total allowance for credit losses on loans Total allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures The above table includes the impact of ASU 2016-13 adoption for PCD assets previously classified as PCI. The change in the ACL includes attributable to residential and commercial real estate loans, and the amortized cost basis of loans receivable was increased for those loans by that total amount. In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, creating a forbearance program for federally backed mortgage loans, protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the National Emergency, and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (TDR) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. The Company elected to not apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 for loans eligible under the CARES Act, based on the modification s (1) relation to COVID-19, (2) execution for a loan that was not more than 30-days past due as of December 31, 2019, and (3) execution between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of the date that falls 60 days following the termination of the declared National Emergency, or December 31, 2020. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law in December 2020, extended the window during which loans could have been modified without classification as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40, to the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days following the termination of the declared National Emergency.

The securities are performing and are of high credit quality. The unrealized losses were caused by increases in market interest rates since purchase or acquisition. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. Corporate and other Obligations. The unrealized losses on the Company s investments in corporate obligations include individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and individual securities which have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. The securities are performing and are of high credit quality. The unrealized losses were caused by increases in market interest rates since purchase or acquisition. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. At June 30, 2023, corporate obligations included pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of and unrealized losses of in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. These unrealized losses were primarily due to the long-term nature of the pooled trust preferred securities, a reduced demand for these securities, and concerns regarding the issuers of the underlying trust preferred securities. A cash flow analysis performed as of June 30, 2023, for these securities indicated it is probable the Company will receive all contracted principal and related interest projected. The cash flow analysis used in making this determination was based on anticipated default, recovery, and prepayment rates, and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on the yield spread anticipated at the time the securities were purchased. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company has not recorded an ACL on these securities. Asset-Backed securities.

Construction Commercial Consumer loans Commercial loans Loans in process ) ) Deferred loan fees, net ) ) Allowance for credit losses ) ) Total loans The Company s lending activities consist of origination of loans secured by mortgages on one- to four-family residences and commercial and agricultural real estate, construction loans on residential and commercial properties, commercial and agricultural business loans and consumer loans. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had purchased participation interests in loans totaling million, as compared to loans totaling million at June 30, 2022, with the increase due primarily to participations acquired in the Citizens merger. Residential Mortgage Lending. The Company actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. This category includes both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ARM loans amortizing over periods of up to , and the properties securing such loans may be owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied. Single-family residential loans do not generally exceed of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Company s portfolio are located within the Company s primary lending area. General risks related to one- to four-family residential lending include stability of borrower income and collateral values. The Company also originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company s primary lending area but made to borrowers who operate within our primary market area. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Company are amortized over periods generally up to , with balloon maturities typically up to . Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is typical for the Company to include an interest rate floor and ceiling in the loan agreement. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. General risks related to multi-family residential lending include rental demand and supply, rental rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage.

 million of the Company s billion in commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located outside our primary lending area. Risks to owner-occupied commercial real estate lending generally include the continued profitable operation of the borrower s enterprise, as well as general collateral values, and may be heightened by unique, specific uses of the property serving as collateral. Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate lending risks include tenant demand and performance, lease rates, and vacancies, as well as collateral values and borrower leverage. These factors may be influenced by general economic conditions in the region, or in the United States generally. Risks to lending on farmland include unique factors such as commodity prices, yields, input costs, and weather, as well as farmland values. Most commercial real estate loans originated by the Company generally are based on amortization schedules of up to with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, the interest rate received on these loans is fixed for a maturity for up to , with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually after an initial period up to . The Company typically includes an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. Generally, improved commercial real estate loan amounts do not exceed 80 of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Agricultural real estate terms offered differ slightly, with amortization schedules of up to with an 80 loan-to-value ratio, or with a 75 loan-to-value ratio. Construction Lending. The Company originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. Construction loans originated by the Company are generally to finance the construction of owner occupied residential real estate, or to finance speculative construction of residential real estate, land development, or owner-operated or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments, with single-family residential construction loans having maturities ranging from six to , while multi-family or commercial construction loans typically mature in 12 to . Once construction is completed, permanent construction loans may be converted to monthly payments using amortization schedules of up to on residential and generally up to on commercial real estate. Construction and development lending risks generally include successful timely and on-budget completion of the project, followed by the sale of the property in the case of land development or non-owner-occupied real estate, or the long-term occupancy of the property by the builder in the case of owner-occupied construction. Changes in real estate values or other economic conditions may impact the ability of a borrower to sell property developed for that purpose. While the Company typically utilizes relatively short maturity periods to closely monitor the inherent risks associated with construction loans for these loans, weather conditions, change orders, availability of materials and/or labor, and other factors may contribute to the lengthening of a project, thus necessitating the need to renew the construction loan at the balloon maturity. Such extensions are typically executed in incremental periods to facilitate project completion. The Company s average term of construction loans is approximately . During construction, loans typically require monthly interest only payments which may allow the Company an opportunity to monitor for early signs of financial difficulty should the borrower fail to make a required monthly payment. Additionally, during the construction phase, the Company typically performs interim inspections which further provide the Company an opportunity to assess risk. At June 30, 2023, construction loans outstanding included loans, totaling million, for which a modification had been agreed to. At June 30, 2022, construction loans outstanding included loans, totaling million, for which a modification had been agreed to. In general, these modifications were solely for the purpose of extending the maturity date due to conditions described above, pursuant to the Company s normal underwriting and monitoring procedures. As these modifications were not executed due to financial difficulty on the part of the borrower, they were not accounted for as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs).

 , with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest and are for a period of . Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust and are issued up to of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage and are typically issued for a term of ten years. Interest rates on the HELOCs are generally adjustable. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. Risks related to HELOC lending generally include the stability of borrower income and collateral values. Automobile loans originated by the Company include both direct loans and a smaller amount of loans originated by auto dealers. The Company generally pays a negotiated fee back to the dealer for indirect loans. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to of the purchase price of the vehicle. Risks to automobile and other consumer lending generally include the stability of borrower income and borrower willingness to repay. Commercial Business Lending . The Company s commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit, including agricultural production and equipment loans. The Company offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial business loans. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to , while commercial operating lines of credit or agricultural production lines are generally for a period. Commercial lending risk is primarily driven by the borrower s successful generation of cash flow from their business enterprise sufficient to service debt, and may be influenced by factors specific to the borrower and industry, or by general economic conditions in the region or in the United States generally. Agricultural production or equipment lending includes unique risk factors such as commodity prices, yields, input costs, and weather, as well as farm equipment values. Allowance for Credit Losses . The PCL for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, was a charge of million, a charge of million, and a recovery of million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the ACL required for PCD loans acquired in the Citizens merger was million, and was funded through purchase accounting adjustments, while the ACL required for non-PCD loans acquired in the Citizens merger was million and was funded through a charge to PCL. Additionally, the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures was increased by million due to the Citizens merger and funded through a charge to PCL. Exclusive of the charges required as a result of the Citizens merger, the Company would have recorded a PCL of approximately million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, of which million was attributable to the required ACL for loan balances outstanding, while million was attributable to the required allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the ACL required for PCD loans acquired in the Fortune merger was , and was funded through purchase accounting adjustments, while the ACL required for non-PCD loans acquired in the Fortune merger was million, and was funded through a charge to PCL. Additionally, the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures was increased by due to the Fortune merger and funded through a charge to PCL. Exclusive of the charges required as a result of the Fortune merger, the Company would have recorded a negative PCL of approximately in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Exclusive of provisioning required by the Citizens merger, increased provisioning for loan balances outstanding in the year ended June 30, 2023 is attributable primarily to loan growth, qualitative adjustments to modeled results based on levels and trends of industry past due loans, and the unguaranteed portion of a small pool of SBA loans exhibiting signs of credit stress, partially offset by a decreased ACL estimate for classified hotel loans that had been slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased provisioning for off-balance sheet credit exposures is attributable primarily to changes in the level and mix of outstanding credit commitments. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of June 30, 2023, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date is adequate based on that estimate. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of (annualized) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as

 basis point (annualized) during the same period of the prior fiscal year. Specifically, management considered the following primary items in its estimate of the ACL: economic conditions and projections as provided by Moody s Analytics, including baseline and downside scenarios, were utilized in the Company s estimate at June 30, 2023. Economic factors considered in the projections included national and state levels of unemployment, and national and state rates of inflation-adjusted growth in the gross domestic product. Economic conditions are considered to be a moderate and stable risk factor, relative to June 30, 2022; the pace of growth of the Company s loan portfolio, exclusive of acquisitions or government guaranteed loans, relative to overall economic growth. This measure is considered to be a moderate and increasing risk factor, relative to June 30, 2022; levels and trends for loan delinquencies nationally and in the region. This measure as reported remains relatively stable, and the level of uncertainty about loan delinquencies is considered to be diminishing. This is considered to be a moderate and stable risk factor, relative to June 30, 2022; exposure to the hotel industry, in particular, metropolitan area hotels which were negatively impacted by activity restrictions and a lack of business or convention-related travel. This is considered to be an elevated and stable risk factor, relative to June 30, 2022. PCD Loans. In connection with the Citizens Bancshares, Co. Citizens merger on January 20, 2023, and Fortune Financial Corporation Fortune merger on February 25, 2022, the Company acquired loans both with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination. Acquired loans are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition with no carryover from the acquired institution s previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses. Acquired loans are accounted for under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses. The fair value of acquired loans recorded at the time of acquisition is based upon several factors, including the timing and payment of expected cash flows, as adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayments, and then discounting these cash flows using comparable market rates. The resulting fair value adjustment is recorded in the form of a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of the respective loans. As it relates to acquired loans that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination PCD ), the net premium or net discount is adjusted to reflect the Company s allowance for credit losses recorded for PCD loans at the time of acquisition, and the remaining fair value adjustment is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. As it relates to loans not classified as PCD non-PCD loans, the credit loss and yield components of their fair value adjustment are aggregated, and the resulting net premium or net discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the respective loans. The Company records an ACL for non-PCD loans at the time of acquisition through provision expense, and therefore, no further adjustments are made to the net premium or net discount for non-PCD loans. Loans that the Company acquired from Citizens and Fortune that, at the time of acquisition, had more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination are classified as PCD loans and presented in the table below at acquisition carrying value: Allowance for credit losses at acquisition ) Fair value of PCD loans at acquisition

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on all loans at origination, and is updated on a quarterly basis for loans risk rated Watch, Special Mention, Substandard, or Doubtful. In addition, lending relationships of million or more, exclusive of any consumer or owner-occupied residential loan, are subject to an annual credit analysis which is prepared by the loan administration department and presented to a loan committee with appropriate lending authority. A sample of lending relationships in excess of million (exclusive of single-family residential real estate loans) are subject to an independent loan review annually, in order to verify risk ratings. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Watch Loans classified as watch exhibit weaknesses that require more than usual monitoring. Issues may include deteriorating financial condition, payments made after due date but within 30 days, adverse industry conditions or management problems. Special Mention Loans classified as special mention exhibit signs of further deterioration but still generally make payments within 30 days. This is a transitional rating and loans should typically not be rated Special Mention for more than 12 months. Substandard Loans classified as substandard possess weaknesses that jeopardize the ultimate collection of the principal and interest outstanding. These loans may exhibit continued financial losses, ongoing delinquency, overall poor financial condition, and insufficient collateral. Doubtful Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses of substandard loans, and have deteriorated to the level that there is a high probability of substantial loss. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be Pass rated loans. A periodic review of selected credits (based on loan size and type) is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses and to assign risk grades. The primary responsibility for this review rests with loan administration personnel. This review is supplemented with periodic examinations of both selected credits and the credit review process by the Company s internal audit function and applicable regulatory agencies. The information from these reviews assists management in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and provides a basis for

Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not adversely classified or determined to not share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated pools of loans for determination of the ACL estimate. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Significant payment delays or shortfalls may lead to a determination that a loan should be individually evaluated for estimated credit losses.

TDRs are evaluated to determine whether they share similar risk characteristics with collectively evaluated loan pools, or must be individually evaluated. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities, and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions. In general, the Company s loans that have been subject to classification as TDRs are the result of guidance under ASU No. 2011-02, which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and typically are returned to performing status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period of at least six months. During fiscal 2023, there were loans modified as TDRs. During fiscal 2022, there were loans modified as TDRs totaling million.

The operating leases are now included as a ROU asset in the premises and equipment line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The corresponding lease liability is included in the accounts payable and other liabilities line item on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. In the February 2022 Fortune merger, the Company assumed a ground lease with an entity that is controlled by a Company insider. This property is in St. Louis County, MO and is in its third year of a twenty year term. ASU 2016-02 also requires certain other accounting elections. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, meaning those with terms under twelve months. ROU assets or lease liabilities are not to be recognized for short-term leases. The calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table below are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company s discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, the ASU requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception over a similar term. The discount rate utilized was .

 of risk-weighted assets. Management believes, as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Effective January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than percent, are considered qualifying community banking organizations and are eligible to opt into an alternative, simplified regulatory capital framework, which utilizes a newly-defined Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR). The CBLR framework is an optional framework that is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies generally applicable capital rule. In April 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced the issuance of two interim final rules to provide temporary relief to community banking organizations. Under the rules, CBLR requirement was a minimum of for calendar year 2021, and thereafter. The Company and the Bank have not made an election to utilize the CBLR framework, but will continue to monitor the available option, and could do so in the future. In August 2020, the Federal banking agencies adopted a final rule updating a December 2018 rule regarding the impact on regulatory capital of adoption of the CECL standard. The rule now allows institutions that adopt the CECL standard in 2020 a five-year transition period to recognize the estimated impact of adoption on regulatory capital. The Company and the Bank elected to exercise the option to recognize the impact of adoption over the five-year period. As of June 30, 2023, the most recent notification from the Federal banking agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category.

Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates. Since a portion of the line may expire without being drawn upon, the total unused lines do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate and residential real estate. Management uses the same credit policies in granting lines of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments. The Company had million in commitments to extend credit at June 30, 2023, and million at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, total commitments to originate fixed-rate loans with terms in excess of one year were million at rates ranging from to , with a weighted-average rate of .

The Company originates collateralized commercial, real estate, and consumer loans to customers in Missouri, Arkansas, and Illinois. Although the Company has a diversified portfolio, loans aggregating billion at June 30, 2023, are secured by single and multi-family residential real estate generally located in the Company s primary lending area.

Aside from such pending claims and lawsuits, which are incident to the conduct of the Company s or the Bank s ordinary business, the Company and the Bank are not parties to any material pending legal proceedings which, in the pinion of management, are expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or operations of the Company.

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the year ended June 30, 2023. Available-for-sale Securities . When quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. For these securities, our Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Nonrecurring Measurements .

 ) Total gains (losses) on assets measured on a non-recurring basis ) The following is a description of valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarch. For assets classified within Level 3 of fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value process is described below. Foreclosed and Repossessed Assets Held for Sale . Foreclosed and repossessed assets held for sale are valued at the time the loan is foreclosed upon or collateral is repossessed and the asset is transferred to foreclosed or repossessed assets held for sale. The value of the asset is based on third party or internal appraisals, less estimated costs to sell and appropriate discounts, if any. The appraisals are generally discounted based on current and expected market conditions that may impact the sale or value of the asset and management s knowledge and experience with similar assets. Such discounts typically may be significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value of these assets. Foreclosed and repossessed assets held for sale are continually evaluated for additional impairment and are adjusted accordingly if impairment is identified. Unobservable (Level 3) Inputs . The following table presents quantitative information about unobservable inputs used in recurring and nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurements at June 30, 2023.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of June 30, 2023, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and several other members of our senior management. Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2022, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer and our Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures and to improve the Company s controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company s business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the year ended June 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc., is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
 133 

Table of Contents 
 management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . As permitted by SEC guidance, management excluded from its assessment, the operations of the Citizens Bancshares Co. merger completed during fiscal year 2023, which is described in Note 14: Business Combinations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The assets acquired in the Citizens Bancshares Co. merger represented approximately 23 of the Company s consolidated assets as of June 30, 2023. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of June 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. As described in Management s report on the internal control over financial reporting, the scope of management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, has excluded Citizens Bancshares and its wholly owned subsidiary acquired on January 20, 2023. We have also excluded Citizens Bancshares from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial reporting, which represented approximately 23 percent of consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2023.
