 PART I Item 1. Business General Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the Corporation ), a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the Bank upon the Bank s conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank Conversion ). The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996. The Corporation is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System FRB ). At June 30, 2023, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of 1.33 billion, total deposits of 950.6 million and stockholders equity of 129.7 million. The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K Form 10-K ), including the audited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. As used in this report, the terms we, our, us, and the Corporation refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. When we refer to the Provident in this report, we are referring to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. When we refer to the Bank or Provident Savings Bank in this report, we are referring to Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., a wholly owned subsidiary of Provident. The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC ), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), the insurer of its deposits. The Bank s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB San Francisco since 1956. The Bank is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp PFC ). The business activities of the Bank consist of community banking, investment services and trustee services for real estate transactions. The Bank s community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding its full-service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. Through its subsidiary, PFC, the Bank conducts trustee services for the Bank s real estate transactions and in the past has held real estate for investment. For additional information, see Subsidiary Activities in this Form 10-K. The activities of PFC are included in the Bank s operating segment results. The Bank s revenues are derived principally from interest earned on its loan and investment portfolios, and fees generated through its community banking activities. On June 22, 2006, the Bank established the Provident Savings Bank Charitable Foundation Foundation in order to further its commitment to the local community. The specific purpose of the Foundation is to promote and provide for the betterment of youth, education, housing and the arts in the Bank s primary market areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The Foundation was funded with a 500,000 charitable contribution made by the Bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The Bank contributed 40,000 to the Foundation in both fiscal 2023 and 2022. Subsequent Event On July 27, 2023, the Corporation announced that the Provident Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.14 per share. Shareholders of Provident common stock at the close of business on August 17, 2023 were entitled to receive the cash dividend, payable on September 7, 2023. Market Area The Bank is headquartered in Riverside, California and operates 12 full-service banking offices in Riverside County and one full-service banking office in San Bernardino County. Management considers Riverside and Western San Bernardino

 counties to be the Bank s primary market for deposits. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank was the largest independent community bank headquartered in Riverside County and had the tenth largest deposit market share of all banks and the second largest of community banks in Riverside County. The large geographic area encompassing Riverside and San Bernardino counties is referred to as the Inland Empire. According to the 2020 Census Bureau population statistics, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties have the fourth and fifth largest populations in California, respectively. The Bank s market area consists primarily of suburban and urban communities. Riverside and Western San Bernardino counties are relatively densely populated and are within the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. According to the United States of America U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in June 2023 for the Inland Empire was 4.4 and in the State of California was 4.6 , compared to 3.6 nationwide. The unemployment data reported in June 2022 was 4.0 in the Inland Empire, 4.2 in the State of California and 3.6 nationwide. The Covid-19 Pandemic of 2020 saw our economy take one of its biggest negative shocks in its modern history. Social distancing made it nearly impossible to go to work, resulting in a significant decline in the labor force. Since then, work practices have slowly shifted to recover the loss. In Southern California, we have seen the labor force steadily increase in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and Los Angeles County. However, while the numbers have not reached pre-pandemic levels in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, they have recovered and are above pre-pandemic levels in the Inland Empire. There is hardly any other region in California that has added more jobs than Riverside County and San Bernardino County. We have outperformed all other regions in Southern California; and, in addition, Silicon Valley and San Francisco. From its peak in May 2020, the unemployment rate has decreased by 11.2 . The booming labor market is reflected in the relatively low unemployment rate for the region. Housing plays an important role in the Inland Empire economy. The low interest rate environment that prevailed for most of the last 20 years favored home buyers and builders alike. But interest rates have increased to their highest level in two decades as the Fed has fought to bring inflation down. This has had a chilling effect on home prices and home sales while creating new uncertainty for builders. The median price peaked in San Bernardino County at 495,000 in April 2022, while Riverside County saw a peak at 650,000 in May. The San Bernardino County median has since slid by nearly 30,000 compared to 55,000 for the Riverside County median. Home sales reached their high point in March 2022, but declined throughout the year and into 2023 as a result of higher mortgage rates. Home sales in February 2023 were 35 lower than a year ago in Riverside County and fell 42 in San Bernardino County. The ultra-low rates that were characteristic of the last few years will not be returning soon. With high rates and limited supply, the housing market faces a difficult year ahead. To simply rattle down further performance statistics for the Inland Empire at this point would be unproductive, meaning that in this section we want to go beyond what a recession would mean to the Inland Empire. Briefly, a national recession would cut back on the U.S. appetite for imports and thereby reduce container shipments with serious negative effects on the region s logistics sector. To make matters worse, employment in the Greater Los Angeles area would also decrease, thereby affecting commuters from the Inland Empire directly. Since unemployment is measured by residency, we would observe increases in the Inland Empire unemployment rate first (think of a lake freezing from the periphery). Reduced spending by higher income commuters has secondary effects on the local economy, thereby lowering output and income of local firms and resulting in a further reduction of logistics employment as a result of fewer retail shipments. (Source: excerpts from the Lowe Institute of Political Economy - The State of the Region the Inland Empire 2023 March 30, 2023). California home sales in June 2023 were 277,490 units, down 4.1 percent from 289,460 homes in May 2023 and down 19.7 percent from a year ago, when a revised 345,760 homes were sold on an annualized basis. Sales of existing single-family homes in California remained below 300,000 units for the ninth consecutive month. The yearly drop was the smallest since May 2022 and marked the first time in a year that sales dropped by less than 20 percent from a year ago. However, the smaller decline was due primarily to weaker sales last June, when sales dropped below 350,000 for the first time in two years. California s median home price exceeded 800,000 in June for the third straight month, up 0.3 percent from May s 836,110 to 838,260 in June. The statewide median price continued to rise and reached the highest level in ten months. Tight housing supply and more high-end homes being sold relative to prior months continued to put upward pressure on prices. Despite the improvement from early 2023, the median home price in California dipped 2.4 on a year-over-year basis for the eighth consecutive month from 858,800 in June 2022. The downward movement in home prices appears to be stabilizing, but more dips in the median price are expected in the coming months as rates will likely remain elevated for most, if not the entire third quarter, of 2023.

 Competition The Bank faces significant competition in its market area in originating real estate loans and attracting deposits. The population growth in the Inland Empire has attracted numerous financial institutions to the Bank s market area. The Bank s primary competitors are large national and regional commercial banks as well as other community-oriented banks and savings institutions. The Bank also faces competition from credit unions and a large number of mortgage companies that operate within its market area, as well as unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these institutions are significantly larger than the Bank and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than the Bank. This competition may limit the Bank s growth and profitability in the future. Reportable Segments Management monitors the revenue and expense components of the various products and services the Bank offers, but operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Corporation-wide basis in comparison to a business plan which is developed each year. Accordingly, all operations are considered by management to be one operating segment and one reportable segment as contained in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to the Corporation s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Internet Website The Corporation maintains a website at www.myprovident.com. The information contained on that website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K. Other than an investor s own internet access charges, the Corporation makes available free of charge through that website the Corporation s annual report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In addition, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding companies that file electronically with the SEC. This information is available at www.sec.gov. Lending Activities General. The lending activity of the Bank is comprised of the origination of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans to be held for investment. Additional lending activities have historically included originating saleable single-family loans, primarily fixed-rate first trust deed mortgages. The Bank s net loans held for investment were 1.08 billion at June 30, 2023, representing 81 of consolidated total assets. This compares to 940.0 million, or 79 of consolidated total assets, at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, the maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to any one borrower and the borrower s related entities under applicable regulations was 19.8 million, or 15 of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had no loans or group of loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. The Bank s five largest lending relationships at June 30, 2023 consisted of: four multi-family loans totaling 5.1 million to one group of borrowers; eight single-family loans totaling 4.5 million to one group of borrowers; two multi-family loans totaling 4.3 million to one group of borrowers; three multi-family loans totaling 4.2 million to one group of borrowers; and one multi-family loan totaling 4.2 million to one group of borrowers. The real estate collateral for these loans are primarily located in Southern and Northern California. At June 30, 2023, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.

The following table sets forth information at June 30, 2023 regarding the dollar amount of principal payments becoming contractually due during the periods indicated for loans held for investment. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of principal payments, loans having no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as becoming due within one year. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of loans held for investment and may cause the Bank s actual principal payment experience to differ materially from that shown below:

 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans held for investment due after one year from June 30, 2023 which have fixed and floating or adjustable interest rates:

Scheduled contractual principal payments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets. The average life of loans is generally substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments. In addition, due-on-sale clauses generally give the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, the borrower sells the real property that secures the loan. The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase, however, when current market interest rates are substantially higher than the interest rates on existing loans held for investment and, conversely, decrease when the interest rates on existing loans held for investment are substantially higher than current market interest rates, as borrowers are generally less inclined to refinance their loans when market rates increase and more inclined to refinance their loans when market rates decrease. The table below describes the geographic dispersion of real estate secured loans held for investment (gross) at June 30, 2023 and 2022, as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding (dollars in thousands): As of June 30, 2023:

Single-Family Mortgage Loans . One of the Bank s primary lending activity is the origination and purchase of adjustable and fixed rate mortgage loans to be held for investment secured by first trust deed mortgages on owner-occupied, single-family (one to four units) residences in the communities where the Bank s branches are located and surrounding areas in Southern and Northern California. During fiscal 2023, the Bank originated 165.9 million of single-family loans to be held for investment, all of which were underwritten in accordance with the Bank s origination guidelines, and did not purchase any single-family loans. This compares to single-family loan originations of 191.7 million and purchases of 6.4 million during fiscal 2022. At June 30, 2023, total single-family loans held for investment increased 37 to 518.8 million, or 48 of the total loans held for investment, from 378.2 million, or 40 of the total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2022. The increase in the single-family loans in fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to new loans originated for investment that exceeded loan principal payments. During fiscal 2023, the Bank had net recoveries of 8,000 in non-performing single-family loans, as compared to net recoveries of 439,000 during fiscal 2022. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, total non-performing single-family loans were 1.3 million and 1.4 million, respectively, net of allowances and charge-offs, and there were no loans past due 30 to 89 days at both dates. The Bank has underwriting standards that generally conform with the standards of the government sponsored entities GSE which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage insurance is usually required for all loans exceeding 80 loan-to-value LTV based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination. The Bank is not currently offering loans with LTV ratios greater than 90 . The ratio is derived by dividing the original loan balance by the lower of the original appraised value or purchase price of the real estate collateral. Currently, the maximum LTV ratio is 90 for purchase and rate and term refinances and 75 for cash-out refinances. The maximum loan amount offered on single-family homes is 1.5 million. The lowest FICO score currently offered for a purchase or no cash-out refinance transaction is 700, while the lowest FICO score for a cash-out refinance transaction is 720. A limited cash-out refinance transaction limits cash back to the borrower to the lesser of 2 of the new loan amount or 2,000.The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrower s credit history, as reported by an independent third party. A higher FICO score indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness. Bank regulators have issued guidance stating that a FICO score of 660 and below is indicative of a subprime borrower. The Bank currently lends on residential properties classified as single-family units, planned unit developments and condominiums. Underwriting standards and guidelines may change at any time given changes in real estate market conditions or changes to GSE policies and guidelines. For additional protection, the Bank purchases lender-paid mortgage insurance for certain single-family mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2023, a total of approximately 136.5 million of single-family mortgage loans with a 79 weighted average LTV at the time of origination have lender-paid mortgage insurance providing a weighted average coverage ratio of approximately 12 of the original loan amount. Prior to fiscal 2009, many of the loans we originated for investment consisted of non-traditional single-family residential loans that do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines as a result of the characteristics of the borrower or property, the loan terms, loan size or exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines. In exchange for the additional risk to us associated with these loans, these borrowers generally are required to pay a higher interest rate, and depending on the credit history, a lower loan-to-value ratio was generally required than for a conforming loan. Our non-traditional single-family residential loans include loans to borrowers who provided limited or no documentation of their income or stated income loans, negative amortization loans (a loan in which accrued interest exceeding the required

 monthly loan payment is added to loan principal up to 115 of the original loan amount), more than 30-year amortization loans, and loans to borrowers with a FICO score below 660 (these loans are considered subprime by the OCC). As of June 30, 2023, these non-traditional loans totaled 20.6 million, comprising 4 of total single-family residential loans held for investment and 2 of total loans held for investment. At that date, stated income loans totaled 15.5 million, more than 30-year amortization loans totaled 6.4 million, low FICO score loans totaled 2.2 million, and negative amortization loans totaled 429,000 (the outstanding balances described may overlap more than one category). The Bank currently offers fixed rate loan products in Riverside and San Bernardino counties and adjustable rate mortgage ARM loans throughout California. Substantially all of the loans originated by the Bank meet GSE underwriting standards based on credit and collateral. The Bank offers several ARM products which adjust semi-annually after an initial fixed period ranging from five to ten years subject to a limitation on semi-annual and lifetime changes. Currently, the ARM programs have a rate consisting of an Index tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), plus a margin. The programs are limited to a maximum semi-annual increase or decrease of one percentage point with a maximum lifetime increase of five percentage points and the rate may not fall below the margin. The portfolio currently consists of the following indices, plus a margin of between 2.00 and 3.25 , which are used to calculate the periodic interest rate changes: the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR that will be transitioned to another similar index starting July 1, 2023, SOFR, the 12-month average U.S. Treasury 12 MAT or the weekly average yield on one-year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year CMT ). Loans based on the LIBOR and SOFR indices constitute a majority of the Bank s loans held for investment. The majority of the ARM loans held for investment have five, seven, or 10-year fixed periods prior to the first adjustment and provide for fully amortizing loan payments throughout the term of the loan. Loans of this type have embedded interest rate risk if interest rates should rise during the initial fixed rate period or if rates should rise beyond the periodic or lifetime caps. Borrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each product in a given interest rate and competitive environment. Recently, during the low-interest rate market environment, existing prior to calendar 2022, the production of ARM loans was significantly lower than fixed rate mortgages. The retention of ARM loans, rather than fixed-rate loans, helps to reduce the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. There is, however, unquantifiable credit risk resulting from the potential of increased interest charges to be paid by the borrower as a result of increases in interest rates. It is possible that, during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of the increase in the required payment from the borrower. Further, the risk of default may increase because ARM loans originated by the Bank occasionally provide, as a marketing incentive, for initial rates of interest below those rates that would apply if the adjustment index plus the applicable margin were initially used for pricing. Because of these characteristics, ARM loans are subject to increased risks of default or delinquency. Additionally, while ARM loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its assets as a result of changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest rate sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in the Bank s cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Conversely, downward adjustments on the Bank s cost of funds typically lag adjustments on ARM loans which may occur more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates on our loan portfolio, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10-K. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act requires lenders to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower s ability to repay any consumer closed-end credit transaction secured by a dwelling and to limit prepayment penalties. Increased risks of legal challenge, private right of action and regulatory enforcement actions result from these rules. The Bank may originate loans that do not meet the definition of a qualified mortgage QM ). To mitigate the risks involved with non-QM loans, the Bank has implemented systems, processes, procedural and product changes, and maintains its underwriting standards, to ensure that the ability-to-repay requirements are adequately addressed.

 A decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs. Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Bank s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors. These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, housing supply and demand, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, fires, droughts and other natural disasters particular to California where substantially all of our real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline from the levels at the time of loan origination, the value of our real estate collateral securing the loans could be significantly reduced. The Bank s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely that the Bank could suffer losses on defaulted loans. Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans . At June 30, 2023, multi-family loans were 461.1 million and commercial real estate loans were 90.6 million, or 43 and 8 , respectively, of loans held for investment. This compares to multi-family loans of 464.7 million and commercial real estate loans of 90.4 million, or 50 and 10 , respectively, of loans held for investment at June 30, 2022. Consistent with its strategy to diversify the composition of loans held for investment, the Bank has emphasized the origination and purchase of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. During fiscal 2023 the Bank originated 69.3 million and did not purchase any multi-family or commercial real estate loans. This compares to multi-family and commercial real estate loan originations of 105.9 million and no loan purchases during fiscal 2022. At June 30, 2023, the average outstanding multi-family per loan balance was approximately 734,000 and the average outstanding commercial real estate per loan balance was approximately 761,000. Multi-family loans originated by the Bank are predominately adjustable rate loans, including hybrid ARM loans, with a term to maturity of 10 to 30 years and a 25 to 30-year amortization schedule. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are also predominately adjustable rate loans, including hybrid ARM loans, with a term to maturity of 10 to 30 years and a 25 to 30-year amortization schedule. Rates on multi-family and commercial real estate ARM loans generally adjust monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually at a specific margin over the respective interest rate index, subject to periodic interest rate caps and life-of-loan interest rate caps. At June 30, 2023, 443.8 million, or 96 , of the Bank s multi-family loans were secured by five to 36-unit projects. The Bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally consists of loans secured by small office buildings, light industrial buildings, warehouses and small retail centers. Properties securing multi-family and commercial real estate loans are primarily located in Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties. The Bank originates multi-family and commercial real estate loans in amounts typically ranging from 350,000 to 6.0 million. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had 61 commercial real estate and multi-family loans with principal balances greater than 1.5 million totaling 134.5 million. The Bank obtains appraisals on all properties that secure multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Underwriting of multi-family and commercial real estate loans includes, among other considerations, a thorough analysis of the cash flows generated by the property to support the debt service and the financial resources, experience and the income level of the borrowers and guarantors. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans afford the Bank an opportunity to price the loans with higher interest rates than those generally available from single-family mortgage loans. However, loans secured by such properties are generally greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and are more susceptible to default as a result of general economic conditions and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. During both fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on non-performing multi-family and commercial real estate loans. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no non-performing or 30 to 89 days delinquent multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Non-performing loans and/or delinquent loans may increase if there is a general decline in California real estate markets and in the event poor general economic conditions prevail. Construction Loans. The Bank originates from time to time two types of construction loans: short-term construction loans and construction/permanent loans. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank originated a total of 1.6 million and 2.2 million of construction loans (including undisbursed loan funds), respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had construction loans totaling 1.9 million and 3.2 million, net undisbursed loan funds of 1.9 million and 3.4 million, respectively, consisting of short-term construction loans totaling 1.7 million and 148,000, and construction/permanent loans totaling 230,000 and 3.1 million respectively.

Table of Contents 
 Short-term construction loans include three types of loans: custom construction, tract construction, and speculative construction. The Bank provides construction financing for single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate properties. Custom construction loans are made to individuals who, at the time of application, have a contract executed with a builder to construct their residence. Custom construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 to 18 months, with adjustable or fixed interest rates at the prime lending rate plus a margin and with loan-to-value ratios of up to 75 of the appraised value of the completed property. The owner secures long-term permanent financing at the completion of construction. At June 30, 2023, there was one custom short-term single-family construction loan for 496,000, net undisbursed loan funds of 49,000. This compares to June 30, 2022 when the Bank had one custom short-term single-family construction loans totaling 90,000, net undisbursed loan funds of 455,000. From time to time the Bank makes lot loans to individuals to finance land acquisition prior to the start of construction or tract construction loans to subdivision builders. These subdivisions are usually financed and built in phases. A thorough analysis of market trends and demand within the area are reviewed for feasibility. Tract construction may include the building and financing of model homes under a separate loan. At June 30, 2023, there was one land loan of 106,000 (reported as other mortgage loans) and one tract construction loan for 1.1 million, net undisbursed loan funds of 567,000, as compared to one land loan for 123,000 (reported as other mortgage loans) and one tract construction loan for 59,000, net undisbursed loan funds of 1.6 million at June 30, 2022. Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed speculative because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed sale contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Bank or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified during or after the construction period. The builder may be required to debt service the speculative construction loan for a significant period of time after the completion of construction until the homebuyer is identified. At June 30, 2023, the speculative construction loans were 94,000, net undisbursed loan funds of 166,000, as compared to none at June 30, 2022. Construction/permanent loans automatically roll from the construction to the permanent phase. The construction phase of a construction/permanent loan generally lasts nine to 12 months and the interest rate charged is generally fixed at a margin above prime rate and with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75 of the appraised value of the completed property. At June 30, 2023, there were 230,000 of custom construction/permanent loans, net undisbursed loan funds of 1.2 million as compared to 3.1 million of custom construction/permanent loans, net undisbursed loan funds of 1.3 million at June 30, 2022. Construction loans under 1.0 million are approved by Bank personnel specifically designated to approve construction loans. The Bank s Loan Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President Single-Family Division and Vice President - Loan Administration, approves all construction loans over 1.0 million. Prior to approval of any construction loan, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and the Bank reviews the existing or proposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project, and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on the project. In the case of a tract or speculative construction loan, the Bank also reviews the experience and expertise of the builder. The Bank obtains credit reports, financial statements and tax returns on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent appraisal of the project, and any other expert report necessary to evaluate the proposed project. In the event of cost overruns, the Bank requires the borrower to deposit their own funds into a loan-in-process account, which the Bank disburses consistent with the completion of the subject property pursuant to a revised disbursement schedule. The construction loan documents require that construction loan proceeds be disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Disbursements are based on periodic on-site inspections by independent inspectors and/or Bank personnel. At inception, the Bank also requires borrowers to deposit funds into the loan-in-process account covering the difference between the actual cost of construction and the loan amount. The Bank regularly monitors the construction loan portfolio, economic conditions and housing inventory. The Bank s property inspectors perform periodic inspections. The Bank believes that the internal monitoring system helps reduce many of the risks inherent in its construction loans. Construction loans afford the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than its single-family mortgage loans. Construction loans, however, are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family mortgage loans because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion

 of the project and the cost of the project. The nature of these loans is such that they are generally more difficult to evaluate and monitor. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. Projects may also be jeopardized by disagreements between borrowers and builders and by the failure of builders to pay subcontractors. Loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan depends on the builder s ability to sell the property prior to the time that the construction loan matures. The Bank has sought to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. In addition, because the Bank s construction lending is in its primary market area, changes in the local or regional economy and real estate market could adversely affect the Bank s construction loans held for investment. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries, and no construction loans were non-performing or 30-89 days delinquent at both June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022. Participation Loan Purchases and Sales. In an effort to expand production and diversify risk, the Bank purchases loans and loan participations, with collateral primarily in California, which allows for greater geographic distribution outside of the Bank s primary lending areas. The Bank generally purchases between 50 and 100 of the total loan amount. When the Bank purchases a participation loan, the lead lender will usually retain a servicing fee, thereby decreasing the loan yield. This servicing fee approximates the expense the Bank would incur if the Bank were to service the loan. All properties serving as collateral for loan participations are inspected by an employee of the Bank or a third-party inspection service prior to being approved by the Loan Committee and the Bank relies upon the same underwriting criteria required for those loans originated by the Bank. The Bank did not purchase any loans to be held for investment in fiscal 2023, compared to 6.4 million of purchased loans to be held for investment (solely single-family) in fiscal 2022. The decline in loan purchases was due primarily to the uncertainty of the asset quality and fewer loans available for purchase. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were 10.6 million and 11.4 million of loans serviced by other financial institutions, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, all loans serviced by others were performing according to their original contractual payment terms. The Bank also sells participating interests in loans when it has been determined that it is beneficial to diversify the Bank s risk. Participation sales enable the Bank to maintain acceptable loan concentrations and comply with the Bank s loans to one borrower policy. Generally, selling a participating interest in a loan increases the yield to the Bank on the portion of the loan that is retained. The Bank did not sell any participation loans in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Commercial Business Loans . The Bank has a Business Banking Department that primarily serves businesses located within the Inland Empire. Commercial business loans allow the Bank to diversify its lending and increase the average loan yield. As of June 30, 2023, commercial business loans were 1.6 million, up 30 from 1.2 million at June 30, 2022. These loans represent secured and unsecured lines of credit and term loans secured by business assets. Commercial business loans are generally made to customers who are well known to the Bank and are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, business equipment and/or other assets. The Bank s commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit. Lines of credit are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above the prime rate and term loans are at a fixed or variable rate. The Bank may also require personal guarantees from financially capable parties associated with the business based on a review of personal financial statements. Commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of assets and have maturities of five years or less. Commercial lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year or less. Commercial business loans involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans and involve risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate loans. Real estate loans are generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral value and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets including real estate, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may not be collectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is secondary and oftentimes an insufficient source of repayment.

 June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no non-performing commercial business loans. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on commercial business loans. Consumer Loans. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank s consumer loans were 65,000 and 86,000, respectively. The Bank offers open-ended lines of credit on unsecured basis. Consumer loans potentially have a greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s ongoing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. The Bank had no non-performing consumer loans at both June 30, 2023 and 2022. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank had no charge-offs or recoveries on consumer loans. Loans Originations, Purchases, Sales and Repayments Mortgage loans are primarily originated for investment. Prior to scaling back originations of saleable single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans during fiscal 2019, a large amount of single-family fixed-rate mortgage loans were originated for sale to institutional investors. Mortgage loans sold to investors generally were sold without recourse other than standard representations and warranties. Generally, mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were sold on a non-recourse basis and foreclosure losses are generally the responsibility of the purchaser and not the Bank, except in the case of Federal Housing Administration FHA and Veterans Administration VA loans used to form Government National Mortgage Association pools, which are subject to limitations on the FHA s and VA s loan guarantees.

Loan Servicing The Bank receives fees from a variety of investors in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual loan payments on loans sold by the Bank to such investors. At June 30, 2023, the Bank was servicing 32.6 million of loans for others, a 13 decrease from 37.7 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to scheduled principal payments and prepayments. Loan servicing includes processing payments, accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes, hazard insurance and other loan-related items such as private mortgage insurance. After the Bank receives the gross mortgage payment from individual borrowers, it remits to the investor a predetermined net amount based on the loan sale agreement for that mortgage. Servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of the estimated net servicing income and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of the estimated net future cash flows consistent with contractually specified servicing fees. The Bank periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment, which is measured as the excess of cost over fair value. This review is performed on a disaggregated basis, based on loan type and interest rate. Generally, loan servicing becomes more valuable when interest rates rise (as prepayments typically decrease) and less valuable when interest rates decline (as prepayments typically increase). In estimating fair values at June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank used a weighted average Constant Prepayment Rate CPR of 7.44 and 10.85 , respectively, and a weighted-average discount rate of 9.05 at both dates. The required impairment reserve against servicing assets at June 30, 2023 and 2022 was 165,000 and 119,000, 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 respectively. In aggregate, servicing assets had a carrying value of 256,000 and a fair value of 91,000 at June 30, 2023, compared to a carrying value of 287,000 and a fair value of 168,000 at June 30, 2022. Asset Quality Delinquent Loans . When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank initiates collection procedures. In most cases, delinquencies are cured promptly; however, if the loan remains delinquent on the 120th day for single-family loans or the 90th day for other loans, or sooner if the borrower is chronically delinquent, and after all reasonable means of obtaining the payment have been exhausted, foreclosure proceedings, according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law, are initiated. Interest income is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on such loans. As of June 30, 2023, total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, were 1.3 million, or 0.10 of total assets, which was primarily comprised of six single-family loans. As of June 30, 2023, 175,000 or 13 percent of the total non-performing loans had a current payment status. This compares to total non-performing assets, net of allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, of 1.4 million, or 0.12 of total assets, all of which had a current payment status at June 30, 2022. The Bank had no real estate owned REO both at June 30, 2023 and 2022.

Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, collateral value, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The Bank measures each non-performing loan based on Accounting Standards Codification ASC 310, Receivables, establishes a collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowance and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible.

 Restructured Loans. A troubled debt restructuring is a loan which the Bank, for reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Bank would not otherwise consider. The loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower s financial difficulty, include but are not limited to: A reduction in the stated interest rate and/or accrued interest;
 An extension of the maturity date, typically longer than 6 months;
 A reduction principal loan balance; and
 Extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites.
 To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Bank. The Bank re-underwrites the loan with the borrower s updated financial information, new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, there were no loans that were newly modified from their original terms, re-underwritten or identified as a restructured loan; 11 loans were upgraded to the pass category; one loan was downgraded to the special mention category and subsequently upgraded back to the pass category; one loan was paid off; and no loans were converted to REO. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were no loans that were newly modified from their original terms, re-underwritten or identified as a restructured loan; three loans were upgraded to the pass category; seven loans were paid off; and no loans were converted to REO. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, no restructured loans were in default within a 12-month period subsequent to their original restructuring. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no loans that were extended beyond their maturity of the modification terms. As of June 30, 2023, the net outstanding balance of the Bank s restructured loans was 708,000, consisting of one loan classified as substandard on non-accrual status. As of June 30, 2023, the restructured loan was delinquent with respect to its payment status. As of June 30, 2022, the net outstanding balance of the Corporation s 13 restructured loans was 4.5 million of which one loan totaling 722,000 was classified as substandard on non-accrual status. As of June 30, 2022, all of the restructured loans were current with respect to their payment status, consistent with their modified terms. The Bank upgrades restructured single-family loans to the pass category if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments for at least six consecutive months or 12 months for those loans that were restructured more than once and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue. Once the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond six or 12 consecutive months, as the case may be, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan. Foreclosed Real Estate. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as REO until it is sold. When a property is acquired, it is recorded at its fair market value less the estimated cost of sale. Subsequent declines in value are charged to operations. As of both June 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no REO property. In managing the real estate owned properties for quick disposition, the Bank completes the necessary repairs and maintenance to the individual properties before listing for sale, obtains new appraisals and broker price opinions BPO to determine current market listing prices, and engages local realtors who are most familiar with real estate sub-markets, among other techniques, which generally results in the quick disposition of real estate owned. Asset Classification. The OCC has adopted various regulations regarding the problem assets of savings institutions. The regulations require that each institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of institutions, OCC examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional

Table of Contents 
 characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. If an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss, the institution establishes an individually evaluated allowance and may subsequently charge-off the amount of the asset classified as loss. A portion of the allowance for loan losses established to cover probable losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful may be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital. Assets that do not currently expose the institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and are closely monitored by the Bank. The following table summarizes classified assets, which is comprised of classified loans located in California, including loans classified by the Bank as special mention, net of allowance for loan losses, and REO at the dates indicated:

In determining whether the Bank s assets expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification, the Bank may consider various factors, including the payment history of the borrower, the loan-to-value ratio, and the debt coverage ratio of the property securing the loan. After consideration of these and other factors, the Bank may determine that the asset in question, though not currently delinquent, presents a risk of loss that requires it to be classified or designated as special mention. In addition, the Bank s loans held for investment may include single-family, commercial and multi-family real estate loans with a balance exceeding the current market value of the collateral which are not classified because they are performing and have borrowers who have sufficient resources to support the repayment of the loan. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loans held for investment. In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other factors, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the collateral securing the loan. The responsibility for the review of the Bank s assets and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance lies with the Internal Asset Review Committee IAR Committee ). The Bank adjusts its allowance for loan losses by charging (crediting) its provision (recovery) for loan losses against the Bank s operations.

 The Bank has established a methodology for the determination of the provision for loan losses. The methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for a collectively evaluated allowance for groups of homogeneous loans and an individually evaluated allowance that is tied to individual problem loans. The Bank s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements. The allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loans held for investment. The loss factors are applied according to loan program type and loan classification. The loss factors for each program type and loan classification are established based on an evaluation of the historical loss experience, prevailing market conditions, concentration in loan types and other relevant factors consistent with ASC 450, Contingency . Homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity and consumer installment loans are considered on a pooled loan basis. A factor is assigned to each pool based upon expected charge-offs for one year. The factors for larger, less homogeneous loans, such as construction and commercial real estate loans, are based upon loss experience tracked over business cycles considered appropriate for the loan type. Collectively evaluated or individually evaluated allowances are established to absorb losses on loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured as prescribed in ASC 310. Estimates of identifiable losses are reviewed continually and, generally, a provision (recovery) for losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis as necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level. Management presents the minutes summarizing the actions of the IAR Committee to the Bank s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For restructured loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying ASC 310, Receivables. For restructured loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is calculated based on the loan s fair value and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required. The IAR Committee meets quarterly to review and monitor conditions in the portfolio and to determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses. To the extent that any of these conditions are apparent by identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee s estimate of the effect of such conditions may be reflected as an individually evaluated allowance applicable to such loans or portfolio segments. Where any of these conditions is not apparent by specifically identifiable problem loans or portfolio segments as of the evaluation date, the IAR Committee s evaluation of the probable loss related to such condition is reflected in the general allowance. Pooled loan factors are adjusted to reflect current estimates of charge-offs for the subsequent 12 months. Loss activity is reviewed for non-pooled loans and the loss factors are adjusted, if necessary. By assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loans held for investment on a quarterly basis, the Bank is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon the most recent information that has become available. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had an allowance for loan losses of 5.9 million, or 0.55 of gross loans held for investment, compared to an allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2022 of 5.6 million, or 0.59 of gross loans held for investment. A 374,000 provision for loan losses was recorded in fiscal 2023, compared to a 2.5 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses in fiscal 2022. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was due primarily to an increase in loans held for investment in fiscal 2023. Management believes, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment at June 30, 2023. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loans held for investment portfolio and upon management s continuing analysis of the factors

 underlying the quality of the loans held for investment. These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loans held for investment, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and determination of the realizable value of the collateral securing the loans. Provisions (recoveries) for loan losses are charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. See Comparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 Provision (Recovery) for Loan Losses below. Management believes that the amount maintained in the allowance will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loans held for investment. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Bank s loans held for investment, will not request the Bank to significantly increase its allowance for loan losses. Future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the control of the Bank.

Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on July 1, 2023, we expect to recognize a reduction to our opening retained earnings of approximately 825,000, net of deferred taxes and other immaterial adjustments, resulting from a pretax increase to our allowance for credit losses of approximately 1.2 million. The increase is primarily related to the difference between the historical incurred loss methodology currently utilized, as compared to estimating lifetime credit losses as required by the CECL standard. Investment Securities Activities Federally chartered savings institutions are permitted under federal and state laws to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises and of state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, certain bankers acceptances, mortgage-backed securities and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest a portion of their assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Savings institutions such as the Bank are also required to maintain an investment in FHLB San Francisco stock. The investment policy of the Bank, established by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Bank s Asset-Liability Committee, seeks to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, complement the Bank s lending activities, and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk or credit risk. Investments are made based on certain considerations, such as credit quality, yield, maturity, liquidity and marketability. The Bank also considers the effect that the proposed investment would have on the Bank s risk-based capital requirements and interest rate risk sensitivity. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank s investment securities portfolio was 156.6 million and 188.4 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of federal agency and GSE obligations. The Bank did not purchase any investment securities during fiscal 2023, compared to 19.0 million of mortgage-backed securities purchased during fiscal 2022. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank s securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10 of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States government or its agencies or a GSE.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds General. Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bank s funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are influenced significantly by general interest rates and money market conditions.

 Francisco and repurchase agreements may be used to compensate for declines in the availability of funds from other sources. Deposit Accounts. Substantially all of the Bank s depositors are residents of the State of California. Deposits are attracted from within the Bank s market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking, savings, money market and time deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary, differentiated by the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current interest rates, profitability to the Bank, interest rate risk characteristics, competition and its customers preferences and concerns. Generally, the Bank s deposit rates are commensurate with the median rates of its competitors within a given market. The Bank may occasionally pay above-market interest rates to attract or retain deposits when less expensive sources of funds are not available. The Bank may also pay above-market interest rates in specific markets in order to increase the deposit base of a particular office or group of offices. The Bank reviews its deposit composition and pricing on a weekly basis. The Bank generally offers time deposits for terms not exceeding seven years. As illustrated in the following table, time deposits represented approximately 23 of the Bank s deposit portfolio at June 30, 2023, compared to approximately 13 at June 30, 2022. The time deposits included 106.4 million of brokered certificates of deposit at June 30, 2023, as compared to no brokered certificates of deposit at June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2023, the Bank had related party deposits of approximately 8.1 million, compared to 6.6 million at June 30, 2022.

 as collateral, provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate, maturity, terms and conditions. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. The Bank utilizes advances from the FHLB San Francisco as an alternative to deposits to supplement its supply of lendable funds, to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to help manage interest rate risk. The FHLB San Francisco has, from time to time, served as the Bank s primary borrowing source. As of June 30, 2023, the FHLB San Francisco borrowing capacity was limited to 40 of the Bank s total assets, amounting to 534.1 million, up from 35 of the Bank s total assets, amounting to 415.7 million at June 30, 2022. Advances from the FHLB San Francisco are typically secured by the Bank s single-family residential, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans. Total mortgage loans pledged to the FHLB San Francisco were 967.6 million at June 30, 2023 as compared to 570.4 million at June 30, 2022. In addition, the Bank pledged investment securities totaling 4.2 million and 4.7 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to collateralize its FHLB San Francisco advances under the Securities-Backed Credit SBC facility. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had 235.0 million and 85.0 million of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB San Francisco with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.34 and 2.20 , respectively. At June 30, 2023, the outstanding borrowings mature between 2023 and 2028 with a weighted average maturity of 12 months. In addition to the total borrowings mentioned above, the Bank utilized its borrowing facility for letters of credit and credit enhancement for loans previously sold to the FHLB San Francisco under the Mortgage Partnership Finance MPF program which have a recourse liability. The outstanding letters of credit were 11.0 million and 18.0 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022; while the outstanding MPF credit enhancement was 216,000 and 2.5 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the remaining financing availability through the FHLB San Francisco was 287.9 million and 310.3 million, with remaining available collateral of 468.6 million and 310.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank also had secured a discount window facility of 139.0 million and 153.9 million at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for 50.0 million, which matures annually on June 30. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or the federal funds facility with the correspondent bank at both dates. As a member of the FHLB San Francisco, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB San Francisco stock. The Bank held the required investment in stock at June 30, 2023 and 2022 of 9.5 million and 8.2 million with no excess investment, respectively. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank purchased FHLB San Francisco capital stock totaling 1.3 million and 84,000, respectively, and did not redeem any of the capital stock during both periods. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the FHLB San Francisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling 556,000 and 489,000, respectively. Subsidiary Activities Federal savings institutions generally may invest up to 3 of their assets in service corporations, provided that at least one-half of any amount in excess of 1 is used primarily for community, inner-city and community development projects. The Bank s investment in its service corporations did not exceed these limits at June 30, 2023 and 2022. The Bank has three wholly owned subsidiaries: PFC, Profed Mortgage, Inc., and First Service Corporation. PFC s current activities include: (i) acting as trustee for the Bank s real estate transactions and (ii) holding real estate for investment, if any. Profed Mortgage, Inc., which formerly conducted the Bank s mortgage banking activities, and First Service Corporation are currently inactive. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank contributed capital of 10,000 and 0 to PFC, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank s investment in its subsidiaries was 13,000 and 7,000, respectively.

 REGULATION The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Corporation and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress Congress that may affect the Corporation s and the Bank s operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Corporation and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, FDIC, FRB and SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the Corporation and the Bank. The Bank cannot predict whether any such changes may occur. General The Bank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as its insurer of deposits. The Bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws, which must be complied with by the Bank. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate the Bank s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FRB, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation and the Bank and their operations. The Corporation, as a savings and loan holding company, is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB, its primary regulator. The Corporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. For additional information, see Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations below in this Form 10-K. Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Corporation. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Corporation. Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of federal savings institutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all federal savings institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law. All federal savings institutions must pay assessments to the OCC, to fund the agency s operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank s OCC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 198,000 and 221,000, respectively. The Bank s general permissible lending limit for loans to one borrower is equal to the greater of 500,000 or 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25 of unimpaired capital and surplus). The Bank s limits on loans to one borrower or group of related

 borrowers at June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 19.8 million and 19.6 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023, the Bank s largest lending relationship to a single borrower or group of borrowers consisted of four multi-family loans totaling 5.1 million, which were performing according to their original payment terms. Effective July 1, 2019, the OCC issued a final rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA which permits an eligible federal savings bank with assets of 20.0 billion or less as of December 31, 2017 to elect to operate with the business powers of a national bank, generally subject to the same limitations and restrictions, without converting to a national bank charter. A federal savings bank that makes the so-called covered savings association election must divest any activities or investments that are not permitted for a national bank. The Bank had not made such an election as of June 30, 2023. Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB San Francisco, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs, each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB - San Francisco is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB - San Francisco. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had 235.0 million and 85.0 million of outstanding advances, respectively, from the FHLB San Francisco with a remaining available credit facility of 287.9 million and 310.3 million, respectively, based on 40 and 35 of total assets, respectively, which is limited to available collateral. For additional information, see Business Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds Borrowings above in this Form 10-K. As a member of the FHLB - San Francisco, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB San Francisco. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank held 9.5 million and 8.2 million of FHLB-San Francisco stock, respectively, which were in compliance with this membership requirement. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank was required to purchase 1.3 million and 84,000 of FHLB San Francisco capital stock, respectively, and the Bank did not redeem any capital stock during both periods. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the FHLB San Francisco distributed cash dividends to the Bank totaling 556,000 and 489,000, respectively. There is no guarantee in the future that the FHLB San Francisco will pay cash dividends or redeem excess capital stock held by its members. Under federal law, the FHLB - San Francisco is required to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. These contributions have in the past adversely affected the level of dividends paid by the FHLB - San Francisco and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions also could have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB - San Francisco stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank s FHLB - San Francisco stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank s capital. Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC insures deposits up to 250,000 per account owner as defined by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. As an insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums in the form of assessments to maintain the DIF and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase its initial base insurance assessment rate schedules by two basis points to improve the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF would be restored to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. The revised assessment rate schedules became effective January 1, 2023, with the first invoice payment date of June 30, 2023 for the assessment period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2023. The Bank s FDIC annual assessments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 459,000 and 322,000, respectively. Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less likely to fail pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than 10 billion in assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution s failure within three years. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.

 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance. Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Like all savings institutions (subject to a narrow exception not applicable to the Bank), the Bank is required to meet a qualified thrift lender QTL test to avoid certain restrictions on its operations. This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65 of its total assets as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. As an alternative, a savings institution may maintain 60 of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Code ), as amended. Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments. Any savings institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter, and a savings and loan holding company of such an institution may become regulated as a bank holding company. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank maintained 92.1 and 90.8 of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments, respectively, and therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test at both dates. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the QTL test as of each month end. Capital Requirements. Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, including a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets leverage ratio, a common equity Tier 1 CET1 to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio and a total capital to risk-based assets ratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 , (ii) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 ; (iii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 ; and (iv) a total capital ratio of 8 . Mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are also deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips. Because of the Bank s asset size, the Bank was given a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt, equity securities and interest-only strips in its capital calculations. The Bank elected to exercise this option to opt-out in order to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels. The Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. If the Bank does not have the ability to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may be limited in its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. In order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Bank must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5 , a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 and the Bank must not be subject to any of certain mandates by the OCC requiring it as an individual institution to meet any specified capital level. EGRRCPA required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 and 10 for institutions with assets of less than 10.0 billion. Institutions with a capital level at or exceeding the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements, and electing the alternative framework, are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. Final rules issued by the agencies established the community bank leverage ratio at 9 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly Call Report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8 or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Company did not opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework for the year ended June 30, 2023. The FASB has adopted a new accounting standard for accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. U.S. GAAP that became effective for the Corporation on July 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss or 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators (the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC) have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. Prompt Corrective Action. An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it meets the minimum capital ratios described above. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution s degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is critically undercapitalized. OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also may take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. As of June 30, 2023, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Limitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions and on their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year up to 100 of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, without regulatory approval. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision or in troubled condition by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC s approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the FRB. The FRB or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Further restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Corporation will be limited, which may limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders. Activities of Savings Associations and Their Subsidiaries. When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the savings institution controls, the savings institution must file a notice or application with the OCC and in certain circumstances with the FDIC and receive regulatory approval or non-objection. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders. With respect to subsidiaries generally, the OCC may determine that investment by a savings institution in, or the activities of, a subsidiary must be restricted or eliminated based on safety and soundness or legal reasons. Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank s authority to engage in transactions with affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the FRB s Regulation W. The term affiliates for these purposes generally mean any company that controls or is under common control with an institution except subsidiaries of the institution. The Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution s capital. Institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. FDIC-insured institutions are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service. Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ), every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires that the FRB assess the Bank s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, especially low and moderate income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial non-compliance. The Bank received a rating of satisfactory when it was last examined for CRA compliance. On May 5, 2022, the federal bank regulatory agencies overhauled the CRA and jointly issued a proposal to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed regulations included major changes from the current regulation and will be effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least 60 days after the publication date of the final rules. The new rules as proposed are intended to: (1) provide expanded access to credit, investment, and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities; (2) address changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking; (3) yield greater clarity, consistency, and transparency; (4) tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type; and (4) maintain a unified approach amongst the regulating agencies. Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) was signed into law on October 26, 2001. The USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company s effectiveness in combating money laundering when reviewing mergers and acquisitions. Regulatory and Criminal Enforcement Provisions. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all institution-affiliated parties, including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease-and-desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can be nearly 2.0 million per day per violation in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations. Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Interest-bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a bank. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to 0 , which eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.

 Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA ), is a federal statute, that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present owners and operators of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term owner and operator excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this secured creditor exemption has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potentially hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer s non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA ), which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for data security breaches, thereby increasing potential liability associated with a data breach, which has triggered a number of class actions against other companies since January 1, 2020. Although the Bank may enjoy several fairly broad exemptions from the CCPA s privacy requirements, those exemptions do not extend to the private right of action for a data security breach. The CCPA, including any amendments thereto or final regulations implemented thereunder, as well as other similar state data privacy laws and regulations, may require the establishment by the Bank of certain regulatory compliance and risk management controls. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule providing for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity incidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible, and no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a computer-security incident rising to the level of a notification incident has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of a banking organization s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization s customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the new rule was required by May 1, 2022. Further, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted final rules that require public companies to promptly disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and detailed information regarding their cybersecurity risk management and governance on an annual basis on Form 10-K. Companies will be required to report on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material within four business days of making that determination. The Form 8-K must describe the incident s material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the company, including its financial condition and results of operations. If any required information about the incident or its impact is not yet determined or is unavailable at the required time of the filing, the company must include a statement to this effect in the Form 8-K and file an amendment to the Form 8-K when that information becomes available. A company must make its materiality determination after it has discovered a cybersecurity incident without unreasonable delay. In addition to incident reporting, the new rules will require companies to describe their cybersecurity processes and governance. Smaller reporting companies, such as the Corporation, will have until June 15, 2024, before they must begin filing the new Form 8-K disclosure. Companies must provide disclosures about cybersecurity risk management and governance beginning with their Form 10-K for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023. Non-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

 Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB exercises broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than 10.0 billion in assets, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the OCC with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights. Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation General. The Corporation is a unitary savings and loan holding company, subject to the regulatory oversight of the FRB. Accordingly, the Corporation is required to register and file reports with the FRB and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Corporation and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the Bank. The FRB has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength doctrine that require holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. These and other FRB policies, as well as the capital conservation buffer may restrict the Corporation s ability to pay dividends. Capital Requirements. For a savings and loan holding company with less than 3.0 billion in consolidated assets that qualifies as a small bank holding company under the FRB s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, such as the Corporation, the capital regulations apply to its savings institution subsidiaries, but not the Corporation, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases. For a description of the capital regulations, see Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Capital Requirements above. Activities Restrictions. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 GLBA provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA also specifies, subject to a grandfather provision, that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Corporation qualifies for the grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Corporation of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Corporation would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to those activities permitted by FRB regulation. Multiple savings and loan holding companies may engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, and certain other activities including acting as a trustee under a deed of trust and real estate investments. If the Bank fails the QTL test, the Corporation must, within one year of that failure, register as, and become subject to the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies. For additional information, see Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions Qualified Thrift Lender Test in this Form 10-K. Mergers and Acquisitions. The Corporation must obtain approval from the FRB before acquiring more than 5 of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Corporation to acquire

 control of a savings institution, the FRB would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Corporation and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community, including performance under the CRA and competitive factors. The FRB may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) supervisory acquisitions and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. Acquisition of the Company. Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a savings and loan holding company subject to registration, examination and regulation by the FRB and must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control or more than 5 of a class of voting stock of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term company includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities. Control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly of more than 25 of any class of the savings association s voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding in certain cases 10 or more of a class of voting securities. Control may be direct or indirect and may occur through acting in concert with one or more other persons. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain FRB approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5 of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5 or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act. Accordingly, the prior approval of the FRB would be required: before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5 or more of the common stock of the Corporation; and before any other company could acquire 25 or more of the common stock of the Corporation, and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10 of such stock. In addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the FRB in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association. Federal Securities Laws. Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). The Corporation is subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The FRB s policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and loan holding companies expresses its view that a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of its consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or any condition

 imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. As discussed above, the capital conservation buffer requirements may also limit or preclude dividends payable by the Corporation. TAXATION Federal Taxation General. The Corporation reports its income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank s reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Corporation. Tax Bad Debt Reserves. As a result of legislation enacted in 1996, the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves was repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. Due to such repeal, the Bank is no longer able to calculate its deduction for bad debts using the percentage-of-taxable-income or the experience method. Instead, the Bank is permitted to deduct as bad debt expense its specific charge-offs during the taxable year. In addition, the legislation required savings institutions to recapture into taxable income, over a six-year period, their post 1987 additions to their bad debt tax reserves. As of the effective date of the legislation, the Bank had no post 1987 additions to its bad debt tax reserves. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank s total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes was approximately 9.0 million. Under current law, a savings institution will not be required to recapture its pre-1988 bad debt reserve unless the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution as defined below. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. Distributions . In the event that the Bank makes non-dividend distributions to Provident that are considered as made from the reserve for losses on qualifying real estate property loans, to the extent the reserve for such losses exceeds the amount that would have been allowed under the experience method or from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans Excess Distributions ), then an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in the Bank s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank s bad debt reserve. Thus, any dividends to Provident that would reduce amounts appropriated to the Bank s bad debt reserve and deducted for federal income tax purposes would create a tax liability for the Bank. The amount of additional taxable income attributable to an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution, then approximately one and one-half times the amount distributed will be included in taxable income for federal income tax purposes. For additional information, see Regulation - Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions - Limitations on Capital Distributions in this Form 10-K for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve. During fiscal 2023, the Bank declared and paid 9.5 million of cash dividends to Provident while Provident declared and paid 4.0 million of cash dividends to shareholders. Excise Tax on Stock Repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a one percent excise tax on the value of corporate share repurchases (net of issuance). On December 27, 2022, the Internal Revenue Services issued Note 2023-2 which provides interim guidance on the implementation of the excise tax on stock repurchases. The excise tax is a non-deductible tax of one percent of the fair market value of the Corporation s stock repurchases, net of restricted stock distributions, stock option exercises, ESOP repurchases and contributions and other qualified activities, occurring after December 31, 2022 in excess of 1.0 million. The excise tax on the stock repurchases in fiscal 2023 was 13,000. Tax Effect from Stock-Based Compensation. During fiscal 2023, there were 93,750 shares of restricted common stock vested and distributed to employees but no shares of restricted stock was distributed to non-employee members of the Corporation s Board of Directors. Also, there were no non-qualified stock options exercised and no incentive stock options were exercised as disqualifying dispositions. As a result, there was a 118,000 federal tax expense from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2023.

 Other Matters. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bank s income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporation s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporation s income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal 2020 and fiscal years thereafter remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal 2019 and fiscal years thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities. State Taxation California. The California franchise tax rate applicable to the Bank, equals the franchise tax rate applicable to corporations generally, plus an in lieu rate of 2 , which is approximately equal to personal property taxes and business license taxes paid by such corporations (but not generally paid by banks or financial corporations such as the Corporation). At June 30, 2023, the Corporation s net state tax rate was 8.9 . Bad debt deductions are available in computing California franchise taxes using the specific charge-off method. The Bank and its California subsidiaries file California franchise tax returns on a combined basis. The Corporation will be treated as a general corporation subject to the general corporate tax rate. There was 68,000 of state tax expense from stock-based compensation in fiscal 2023. Delaware. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Corporation is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax, but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware. During fiscal 2023, the Corporation paid franchise taxes of 200,000. Employees and Human Capital As of June 30, 2023, the Bank had 161 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 108 full-time, 53 prime-time and no part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and management believes that its relationship with employees is good. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make the Bank an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by market-based compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. At June 30, 2023, approximately 75.7 of our workforce was female and 24.3 male, and our average employee tenure was approximately 8.5 years, down slightly from an average employee tenure of 8.6 years at June 30, 2022. The ethnicity of our workforce was 41.4 White, 39.8 Hispanic or Latino, 6.6 African American or Black, 6.1 Asian, 4.4 two or more races, 0.6 American Indian or Alaskan Native and 1.1 Not Specified. As part of our compensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market competitive compensation programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to strong base wages, additional programs include quarterly or annual bonus opportunities, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, a Corporation-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, accrued vacation and sick time, family leave, and an employee assistance program. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. In support of our commitment, we provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. A core value of our talent management approach is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and dedication in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our commitment to our communities, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our average employee tenure of over eight years reflects the engagement of our employees in this talent management philosophy. Turnover for employees as measured by terminated employees to the average total employees was 41.4 in fiscal 2023, up from 39.8 in fiscal 2022.

Risk Factors We assume and manage a certain degree of risk in order to conduct our business. In addition to the risk factors described below, other risks and uncertainties not specifically mentioned, or that are currently known to, or deemed by, management to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and/or cash flows. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. If any of the circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occur to a significant degree, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions Our business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which we depend. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 68 of our real estate loans were secured by collateral and made to borrowers located in Southern California with the balance located predominantly throughout the rest of California. A return of recessionary conditions or adverse economic conditions in California may reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers ability to repay loans and adversely impact our capital, liquidity, financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, may also adversely affect our profitability. Weakness in the global economy and global supply chain issues have adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade. Changes in agreements or relationships between the United States and other countries may also affect these businesses. A deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve as a result of inflation, a recession, the effects of COVID-19 variants or other factors, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations: an increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures;
 an increase in our allowance for loan losses;
 the slowing of sales of foreclosed assets;
 a decline in demand for our products and services;
 a decline in the value of collateral for loans may in turn reduce customers borrowing power, and the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and
 a decrease in the amount of our low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits.
 A decline in California economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Many of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for a mortgage loan is located could negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Real estate values are affected by various other factors, including changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters such as fires, droughts and earthquakes. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.

 External economic factors, such as changes in monetary policy and inflation and deflation, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the FRB. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the FRB, could lead to inflation, deflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. Inflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 and throughout 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures, while dissipating, have remain elevated throughout the first half of 2023. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Corporation to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates tend to have a more significant impact on our performance than general levels of inflation or deflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or by the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our clients operate. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of the Corporation, its clients, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on the Corporation and its clients which are difficult to quantify in the near-term or long-term. We could be subject to a number of risks as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, ability to execute our growth strategy, and ability to pay dividends. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in demand for our products and services; increased loan losses or other impairments in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses; a decline in collateral for our loans, especially real estate; unanticipated unavailability of employees; increased cyber security risks as employees work remotely; a prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could necessitate a valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets; a triggering event leading to impairment testing on our goodwill or core deposit and customer relationships intangibles, which could result in an impairment charge; and increased costs as the Corporation and our regulators, customers and vendors adapt to evolving pandemic conditions. Risks Related to our Lending Activities Our business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property. At June 30, 2023, 518.8 million, or 48 of our loans held for investment, were secured by single-family residential real property. This type of lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that may significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Jumbo single-family loans which do not conform to secondary market mortgage requirements for our market areas are not immediately saleable in the secondary market and may expose us to increased risk because of their larger balances. Higher market interest rates, recessionary conditions or declines in the volume of single-family real estate sales and/or the sales prices as well as elevated unemployment rates, may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial condition and business operations. A few of our legacy residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated a first mortgage with an 80 loan-to-value ratio and a concurrent second mortgage for a combined loan-to-value ratio of up to 100 or because of a decline in home values in our market areas. Residential loans 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 with high loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. Our multi-family and commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers. We originate multi-family and commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by residential and non-residential properties. At June 30, 2023, we had 551.7 million or 51 of total loans held for investment in multi-family and commercial real estate loans. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a single-family residential loan. Repayment on these loans typically is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower s project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by single-family residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as single-family residential real estate. In addition, many of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity, which would require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property to make the ballon payment at maturity, thus increasing the risk of default or non-payment. A secondary market for many types of multi-family and commercial real estate loans is not readily liquid, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we foreclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for a single-family residential mortgage loan because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs on multi-family and commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred within the single-family residential loan portfolio. We occasionally purchase loans in bulk or pools. We may experience lower yields or losses on loan pools because the assumptions we use when purchasing loans in bulk may not prove correct. In order to achieve our loan growth objectives and/or improve earnings, we may purchase loans, either individually, through participations, or in bulk. We did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2023, as compared to the purchase of 6.4 million of single-family loans to be held for investment in fiscal 2022. When we determine the purchase price we are willing to pay to purchase loans in bulk, management makes certain assumptions about, among other things, how fast borrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market, our ability to collect loans successfully and, if necessary, our ability to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. In addition, when we purchase loans, we perform certain due diligence procedures and typically require customary limited indemnities. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change, the purchase price paid for pools of loans may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For example, if we purchase pools of loans at a premium and some of the loans are prepaid before we modeled, we will earn less interest income on the purchase than expected. Our success in growing our loan portfolio through purchases of loan pools depends on our ability to price loan pools properly and on the general economic conditions within the geographic areas where the underlying properties of our loans are located. Acquiring loans through bulk purchases may involve acquiring loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may not have substantial prior experience. We may be exposed to a greater risk of loss to the extent that bulk purchases contain such loans.

 Our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. Lending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things: cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;
 the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;
 the duration of the loan;
 the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower; and
 changes in economic and industry conditions.
 We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision (recovery) for loan losses charged (credited) to expense, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to: our collectively evaluated allowance, based on our historical default and loss experience and certain macroeconomic factors based on management s expectations of future events; our individually evaluated allowance, based on our evaluation of non-performing loans and the underlying fair value of collateral or based on discounted cash flow for restructured loans; and an unallocated reserve to provide for other credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the other loss factors. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If our estimates are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses, which is charged against income. In addition, deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the provision for loan losses and our allowance for loan losses. Further, included in our single-family residential loan portfolio, which comprised 48 of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2023, were 20.6 million or 4 of total loans held for investment that were non-traditional single-family loans, which include negative amortization and more than 30-year amortization loans, stated income loans and low FICO score loans, all of which have a higher risk of default and loss than conforming residential mortgage loans. Management also recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner and will increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, beginning on July 1, 2023, the Bank is required to adopt the CECL standard to determine estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses at inception of the loan. The adoption of CECL will change the allowance calculation methodology from a historical incurred loss model to an expected future loss model, which will require us to increase our allowance for credit losses.

 If our non-performing assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, our non-performing assets were 1.3 million and 1.4 million, or 0.10 and 0.12 of total assets, respectively. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways: we record interest income only on a cash basis for non-performing loans except for non-performing loans under the cost recovery method where interest is applied to the principal of the loan as a recovery of the charge-offs, if any, and we do not record interest income for REO; we must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses; non-interest expense increases when we write down the value of REO properties to reflect changing market values or recognize other-than-temporary impairment OTTI on non-performing investment securities; there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to REO; and the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can divert them from more profitable activity. If additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non-performing assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced. We obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed upon and the property is taken in as REO and at certain other times during the REO holding period. Our net book value NBV in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs fair value ). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset s NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, the fair value of the investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our NBV in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs. Additional material charge-offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our REO and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs, as required by the bank regulators, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes Fluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FRB. Beginning in March 2022, in response to high inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC commenced increasing the target range for the federal funds rates by implementing multiple increases. As of June 30, 2023, the target range for the federal funds rate was 5.00 to 5.25 . Subsequently, on July 26, 2023, the FOMC raised its targeted range an additional 25 basis points to a range of 5.25 to 5.50 (a 22-year high) as economic conditions remain relatively resilient and inflation remains elevated. More importantly, going forward, the Fed has left the door open for further rate hikes before calendar year-end, although the pace remains unclear. If the FOMC further increases the targeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely rise, which will negatively impact our net interest income and may negatively impact both the housing market by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases and the U.S. economy. We principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.

 A sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. As is the case with many financial institutions, our emphasis on increasing core deposits, those deposits bearing no or a relatively low rate of interest with no stated maturity date, has resulted in our having a significant amount of these deposits, which have a shorter duration than our assets. At June 30, 2023, we had 166.5 million in time deposits that mature within one year, 103.0 million in noninterest-bearing checking accounts and 626.6 million in interest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, most of our mortgage loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our securities portfolio available for sale. Generally, the fair value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our consolidated balance sheet or projected operating results. For additional information concerning the effect of interest rates on our loan portfolio, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10-K. Certain hedging strategies that we may use to manage investment in mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. We may use derivative instruments to economically hedge mortgage servicing assets, mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments to offset changes in fair value resulting from changing interest rate environments. Our hedging strategies are susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. In addition, hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings. We may incur losses on our securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect to the securities, defaults by, or other adverse events affecting, the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, and would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. For the year ended June 30, 2023, we did not incur any other-than-temporary impairments on our securities portfolio.

 Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Matters Non-compliance with the USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. If our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze, and control the types of risk to which we are subject to. These risks include, among others, liquidity, credit, market, interest rate, operational, legal and compliance, and reputational risk. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies, and procedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk management or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that it will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as they may exist, or develop in the future, including risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences. Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect our business and results of operations. The effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue, and the United States has entered into international agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures, such as reentering the Paris Agreement. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it difficult, or even impossible, to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the real property, and/or the value of the real property, securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, natural disasters and related events, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Our litigation related costs may increase. We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the Bank s business. Our involvement in litigation may increase significantly. The expenses of some legal proceedings will adversely affect the our results of operations until they are resolved. Further, there can be no assurance that the our loan workouts and other activities will not expose us to additional legal actions, including lender liability or environmental claims. Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud We are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology. Our security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, fraudulent or unauthorized access, denial or degradation of service attacks, misuse, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage. Further, our cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third party processing services. As such, we are subject to risk from data breaches of such third party s information systems or their payment processors. Such a data security breach could compromise our account information. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers card accounts, as well as costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. We may also incur other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts or credit monitoring services. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our customers or counterparties confidential information, including employees. The Corporation is continuously working to install new and upgrade its existing information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around ransomware, phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to further protect the Corporation against cyber risks and security breaches. There continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for companies, including ours. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, some of our customers may have been affected by these breaches, which

 could increase their risks of identity theft, debit and card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us. Security breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions. Any compromise of our security could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Although we have developed and continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could result in losses to us or our customers, our loss of business and/or customers, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, our inability to grow our online services or other businesses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions . While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. While the Corporation selects third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher transaction volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches or if we otherwise have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. We cannot ensure that such breaches, failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches, system failures or other disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes. We are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer s information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.

 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally We are required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index starting July 1, 2023. The LIBOR index was discontinued on June 30, 2023. Many of the loans in the Bank s existing loan portfolio are tied to the LIBOR index and are required to be transitioned to another interest rate indices by June 30, 2023. The Bank formed a committee in 2020 to study the options available and evaluate the risks associated with the transition. The purpose of the committee is to recommend replacement indices that will have a limited impact to earnings, reduce the exposure to legal and accounting risks, and meet regulatory guidelines. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank had 132.0 million of single-family and 337.4 million of multi-family and commercial real estate adjustable LIBOR indexed loans. The FRB issued a new regulation, Regulation ZZ, which specifically addresses tough legacy contracts, which are LIBOR contracts that will not mature by June 30, 2023, cannot be easily amended, and lack adequate fallback provisions for determining a replacement benchmark. Loans covered by and that transition to a replacement index under Regulation ZZ are afforded the safe harbors and protections provided under Regulation ZZ, such as (among others) that the Bank is not to be subject to any claim or cause of action in law or equity or request for equitable relief, or have liability for damages, arising out of the selection of the Board-selected benchmark replacement as a replacement index for LIBOR. The Committee has tested the Bank s operating, documentation, and accounting systems and believes they will be able to handle the transition before sunset of the indexes. The effect on revenue should be approximately neutral. The legal and compliance risks are minimized by following Regulation ZZ and the regulatory guidance issued by the FRB, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (a group of private-market participants convened by the FRB and the New York Fed to help ensure a successful transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR) and the CFPB. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our existing borrowings may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with clients and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the California markets in which our loans are concentrated, negative operating results, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Form 10-K. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. We rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by a third party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us. Additionally, the bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of our vendors performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation. Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high. We are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action. The financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete. The financial services market is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters in our primary market area may result in material losses because of damage to collateral properties and borrowers inability to repay loans. Since our geographic concentration is in California, we are subject to earthquakes, fires, mudslides, droughts and other natural disasters. A major earthquake or other natural disaster may disrupt our business operations for an indefinite period of time and could result in material losses, although we have not experienced any losses in many years as a result of earthquake damage or other natural disaster. Although we are in an earthquake prone area, we and other lenders in the market area may not require earthquake insurance as a condition of making a loan. In addition to possibly sustaining damage to our own properties, if there is a major earthquake, fire, mudslide, or other natural disaster, we face the risk that 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 many of our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained job interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations. Any breach of representations and warranties made by us to our loan purchasers or credit default on our loan sales may require us to repurchase or substitute such loans we have sold. We have previously engaged in bulk loan sales pursuant to agreements that generally require us to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by us to the loan purchaser. Any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or, in some cases, upon any fraud or early payment default on such mortgage loans, may require us to repurchase or substitute loans. Any claims asserted against us in the future by one of our loan purchasers may result in liabilities or legal expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Bank did not repurchase any loans. Additionally, the Bank did not have any claims or settlements for previously sold loans during fiscal 2023 and 2022. Our assets as of June 30, 2023 include a deferred tax asset, the full value of which we may not be able to realize. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2023, the net deferred tax asset was approximately 218,000, a decrease from 1.4 million at the prior fiscal year end. The net deferred tax asset results primarily from (1) deferred loan costs, (2) provisions for loan losses recorded for financial reporting purposes, which were in the past significantly larger than net loan charge-offs deducted for tax reporting proposes and (3) deferred compensation, among others. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income. We believe the recorded net deferred tax asset at June 30, 2023 is fully realizable based on our expected future earnings; however, expected future earnings may not be realized, which could impact our deferred tax assets. Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. We rely on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level. We are an entity separate and distinct from our principal subsidiary, the Bank, and derive substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level in the form of dividends from that subsidiary. Accordingly, we are, and will continue to be, dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, to satisfy our other cash needs and to pay dividends on our common stock. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors.

 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties At June 30, 2023, the net book value of the Corporation s property (including land and buildings) and its furniture, fixtures and equipment was 7.1 million. The Corporation s home office is located in Riverside, California. Including the home office, the Corporation has 13 retail banking offices, 12 of which are located in Riverside County in the cities of Riverside (5), Moreno Valley, Hemet, Sun City, Rancho Mirage, Corona, Temecula and Blythe. One office is located in Redlands, San Bernardino County, California. The Corporation owns six of the retail banking offices and has seven leased retail banking offices. The leases expire from 2024 to 2028. In the opinion of management, all properties are adequately covered by insurance, are in a good state of repair and are appropriately designed for their present and future use. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Corporation, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Corporation holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, employment matters and other issues in the ordinary course of and incidental to the Corporation s business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. Additionally, in some actions, it is difficult to assess potential exposure because the Corporation is still in the early stages of the litigation. The Corporation is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations or cash flows. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information and Holders The common stock of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol PROV. At June 30, 2023, there were 7,043,170 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 402 shareholders of record, and there were approximately 1,868 persons or entities that hold stock in nominee or street name accounts with brokers. Dividends The Corporation s cash dividend payout policy is reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has declared quarterly cash dividends on the Corporation s common stock for consecutive quarters since September 30, 2002. On April 27, 2023, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.14 per share with a record date May 18, 2023 and the dividend was payable on June 8, 2023. Future declarations or payments of dividends will be subject to the consideration of the Corporation s Board of Directors, which will take into account the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, legal restrictions, economic conditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation. Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of 
 48 

Table of Contents 
 net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared. No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods. Dividends on common stock from Provident depend substantially upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is Provident s predominant source of income. Management s projections show an expectation that cash dividends will continue for the foreseeable future.

 Forward-looking statements are based upon management s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements included in this document or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements discussed in this document might not occur, and you should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These factors could cause our actual results for the fiscal 2024 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect the Corporation s consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations as well as its stock price performance. General Provident, a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of the Bank upon the Bank s conversion completed on June 27, 1996. Provident is regulated by the FRB. At June 30, 2023, the Corporation, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of 1.33 billion, total deposits of 950.6 million and total stockholders equity of 129.7 million. Provident has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California. The Bank is regulated by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, the insurer of its deposits. The Bank s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System since 1956. The Corporation operates in a single business segment through the Bank. The Bank s activities include attracting deposits, offering banking services and originating and purchasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and, to a lesser extent, other mortgage, commercial business and consumer loans. Deposits are collected primarily from 13 banking locations located in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. Loans are primarily originated and purchased in Southern and Northern California to be held for investment. There are various risks inherent in the Corporation s business including, among others, the general business environment, interest rates, the California real estate market, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the repurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary market conditions to sell loans, competitive conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying selected Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Estimates The discussion and analysis of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Corporation s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time they are made, and changes in these estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. Allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management, which has a material impact on the carrying value of net loans held for investment. Management considers the accounting

Table of Contents 
 estimate related to the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requiring management to make assumptions about probable incurred losses inherent in the loans held for investment at the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450, Contingencies, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and can be estimated; and (ii) ASC 310, Receivables. The allowance has two components: collectively evaluated allowances and individually evaluated allowances on loans held for investment. Each of these components is based upon estimates that can change over time. The allowance is based on historical experience and as a result can differ from actual losses incurred in the future. The Corporation also applies qualitative loss factors by assessing general economic indicators such as gross domestic product, retail sales, unemployment rates, employment growth, California home sales and median California home prices, as well as peer group data, reflecting the effect of events that have occurred but are not yet evidenced in the historical data. The historical data is reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made as needed. Various techniques are used to arrive at an individually evaluated allowance, including discounted cash flows and the fair market value of collateral. Management considers, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in loans held for investment. The use of these techniques is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates, which, can materially affect amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Corporation assesses loans individually and classifies loans when the accrual of interest has been discontinued, loans have been restructured or management has serious doubts about the future collectability of principal and interest, even though the loans may currently be performing. Factors considered in determining classification include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, the financial condition of the borrower and current economic conditions. The Corporation measures each non-performing loan based on the fair value of its collateral, less selling costs, or discounted cash flow and charges off those loans or portions of loans deemed uncollectible. Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 150 days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and 120 days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For restructured loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying ASC 310. For restructured loans that are less than 90 days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass and, containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is calculated based on the loan s fair value and if the fair value is higher than the individual loan balance, no allowance is required. A restructured loan is a loan which the Bank, for reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Bank would not otherwise consider. The loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower s financial difficulty, include but are not limited to: A reduction in the stated interest rate and/or accrued interest;
 An extension of the maturity date, typically longer than 6 months;
 A reduction in the principal loan balance; and
 Extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites.

Table of Contents 
 The Bank measures the allowance for loan losses of restructured loans based on the difference between the original loan s carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective yield of the loan. Based on published guidance with respect to restructured loans from certain banking regulators and to conform to general practices within the banking industry, the Bank may determine that it is appropriate to maintain certain restructured loans on accrual status because there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance, consistent with the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Other restructured loans are classified as Substandard and placed on non-performing status. The loans may be upgraded and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of payment performance (usually six months or, for loans that have been restructured more than once, 12 months) and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue; and if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan. In addition to the payment history described above, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans must also demonstrate a combination of corroborating characteristics to be upgraded, such as: satisfactory cash flow, satisfactory guarantor support, and additional collateral support, among others. To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Bank. The Bank re-underwrites the loan with the borrower s updated financial information, new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies. Interest is not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than 90 days delinquent or if the loan is deemed impaired. In addition, interest is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected. When a loan is categorized as non-performing, all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed in the current operating results. When a full recovery of the outstanding principal loan balance is in doubt, subsequent payments received are first applied as a recovery of principal charged-off and then to unpaid principal. This is referred to as the cost recovery method. A loan may be returned to accrual status at such time as the loan is brought fully current as to both principal and interest, and, in management s judgment, such loan is considered to be fully collectible on a timely basis. However, the Bank s policy also allows management to continue the recognition of interest income on certain non-performing loans. This is referred to as the cash basis method under which the accrual of interest is suspended and interest income is recognized only when collected. This policy applies to non-performing loans that are considered to be fully collectible but the timely collection of payments is in doubt. Provision for Income Taxes. Management accounts for income taxes by estimating future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Corporation s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, management is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the Corporation s income tax exposures, including judgments in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in management s subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations. Executive Summary and Operating Strategy Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California. The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank and through its subsidiary, PFC. The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank, consist of community banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the Bank. 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 Community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Bank s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Also, to a lesser extent, the Bank originates construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans. The primary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Additionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others. The Corporation intends to improve its community banking business by moderately increasing total assets by increasing single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans. In addition, the Corporation intends to decrease the percentage of retail time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of lower cost checking and savings accounts and to diversify the deposit instruments, including the use of brokered certificates of deposit and State of California s time deposits, subject to market conditions and the Corporation s funding needs. This strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin and ultimately, coupled with the growth of the Corporation, an increase in net interest income. While the Corporation s long-term strategy is for moderate growth, management recognizes that growth may be affected by general economic conditions and other factors. Investment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to the Bank s depositors. Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue. PFC performs trustee services for the Bank s real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment. There are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the Corporation s control, including: changes in accounting principles, laws, regulation, interest rates and the economy, among others. The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management. The California economic environment presents heightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Since the majority of the Corporation s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the value of California real estate may also inhibit the Corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate. For further details on risk factors and uncertainties, see Safe-Harbor Statement included above in this Item 7, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2023 and 2022 Total assets increased 145.9 million, or 12 , to 1.33 billion at June 30, 2023 from 1.19 billion at June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loans held for investment and, to a lesser extent, an increase in cash and cash equivalents, partly offset by a decrease in investment securities. Total cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, increased 42.4 million, or 181 , to 65.8 million at June 30, 2023 from 23.4 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was consistent with the Corporation s strategy of adequately managing credit and liquidity risk. Total investment securities (held to maturity and available for sale) decreased 31.9 million, or 17 , to 156.5 million at June 30, 2023 from 188.4 million at June 30, 2022. The decrease was the result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on investment securities. During fiscal 2023, the Bank did not purchase any investment securities, while in fiscal 2022, the Bank purchased 19.0 million of government sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The Bank did not sell any investment securities during fiscal 2023 and 2022. For additional information on investment securities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

 Loans held for investment, net increased 137.6 million, or 15 to 1.08 billion at June 30, 2023 from 940.0 million at June 30, 2022. In fiscal 2023, the Bank originated 237.1 million of loans held for investment, down 21 from 299.8 million during fiscal 2022, in both years consisting primarily of single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans. The Bank did not purchase any loans in fiscal 2023 as compared to the purchase of 6.4 million of loans to be held for investment (solely comprised of single-family loans) in fiscal 2022. Total loan principal payments in fiscal 2023 were 102.3 million, down 54 from 221.3 million in fiscal 2022, due primarily to the mortgage interest rate increases during fiscal 2023. There was no REO acquired in the settlement of loans in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. The balance of multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans, net of undisbursed loan funds, decreased 4.3 million, or 1 , to 555.2 million at June 30, 2023 from 559.5 million at June 30, 2022, and represented 52 and 60 of loans held for investment, respectively. The balance of single-family loans held for investment increased 140.6 million, or 37 , to 518.8 million at June 30, 2023, from 378.2 million at June 30, 2022. For additional information on loans held for investment, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Total deposits decreased 4.9 million, or 1 , to 950.6 million at June 30, 2023 from 955.5 million at June 30, 2022. Transaction accounts decreased 104.8 million, or 13 , to 729.6 million at June 30, 2023 from 834.4 million at June 30, 2022, while time deposits increased 99.8 million, or 82 , to 220.9 million at June 30, 2023 from 121.1 million at June 30, 2022. The increase in time deposits was primarily attributable to the utilization of brokered certificates of deposit. Outstanding brokered certificates of deposit as of June 30, 2023 totaled 106.4 million. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the percentage of transaction accounts to total deposits was 77 and 87 , respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits decreased to 11 at June 30, 2023 from 13 at June 30, 2022. Total retail deposits, defined as total deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposit, decreased by 111.3 million, or 12 to 844.2 million at June 30, 2023 from 955.5 million at June 30, 2022, due primarily to the decline of deposit balances related to a number of customers seeking higher interest rates elsewhere. For additional information on deposits, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Borrowings, consisting of FHLB San Francisco advances increased 150.0 million, or 176 , to 235.0 million at June 30, 2023 from 85.0 million at June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to new advances to fund the increase of loans held for investment. The weighted-average maturity of the Corporation s FHLB San Francisco advances was approximately 12 months at June 30, 2023, down from 16 months at June 30, 2022. For additional information on borrowings, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Total stockholders equity increased 1.0 million or 1 to 129.7 million at June 30, 2023 from 128.7 million at June 30, 2022, primarily as a result of net income and the amortization of stock-based compensation in fiscal 2023, partly offset by stock repurchases (see Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K) and quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders. Comparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 General. The Corporation recorded net income of 8.6 million, or 1.19 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, down 501,000, or 6 , from 9.1 million, or 1.22 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to a 2.8 million increase in the provision for loan losses as a result of a 374,000 provision for loan losses recorded during fiscal 2023 compared to a 2.5 million recovery from the allowance for loan losses during fiscal 2022, a 2.4 million increase in non-interest expense and a 641,000 decrease in non-interest income, partly offset by a 5.4 million increase in net interest income. The Corporation s efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, improved slightly to 69 in fiscal 2023 from 71 in fiscal 2022 as a result of the increase in net interest income. Return on average assets in fiscal 2023 decreased to 0.68 from 0.76 in fiscal 2022 and return on average stockholders equity in fiscal 2023 decreased to 6.58 from 7.14 in fiscal 2022. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 5.4 million, or 17 , to 37.0 million in fiscal 2023 from 31.6 million in fiscal 2022. This increase resulted from an increase in the net interest margin and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin increased 27 basis points to 2.99 in fiscal 2023 from 2.72 in fiscal 2022, due primarily to a 73 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, partly offset by a 50 basis points increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of interest-

Table of Contents 
 earning assets increased 75.4 million, or 7 , to 1.24 billion in fiscal 2023 from 1.16 billion in fiscal 2022. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased 72.2 million, or 7 , to 1.12 billion during fiscal 2023 as compared to 1.05 billion during fiscal 2022. Interest Income. Total interest income increased 11.3 million, or 33 , to 46.0 million for fiscal 2023 from 34.7 million for fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in all interest-earning asset categories, primarily loans receivable. Interest income on loans receivable increased 10.0 million, or 31 , to 42.2 million in fiscal 2023 from 32.2 million in fiscal 2022. This increase was attributable to a higher average loan balance and, to a lesser extent, a higher average loan yield. The average balance of loans receivable increased 158.7 million, or 18 , to 1.03 billion during fiscal 2023 from 870.3 million during fiscal 2022. The weighted average loan yield during fiscal 2023 increased 40 basis points to 4.10 from 3.70 in fiscal 2022, due primarily to the increase in market interest rates resulting from recent FOMC increases in the targeted federal funds rate since March 2022. Interest income from investment securities increased 263,000, or 14 , to 2.2 million in fiscal 2023 from 1.9 million in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in the average yield, partly offset by a decrease in the average balance. The average yield on investment securities increased 34 basis points to 1.26 for fiscal 2023 from 0.92 for fiscal 2022. The increase in the average yield of investment securities was primarily attributable to a lower premium amortization resulting from lower principal payments. Total premium amortization in fiscal 2023 was 791,000, down 760,000, or 49 , from 1.6 million in fiscal 2022. The average balance of investment securities decreased 34.9 million, or 17 , to 172.0 million in fiscal 2023 from 206.9 million in fiscal 2022 as a result of scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. During fiscal 2023, the Bank received 556,000 of cash dividends from its FHLB - San Francisco stock, an increase of 67,000 or 14 from the 489,000 of cash dividends received in fiscal 2022, resulting in an average yield of 6.55 on FHLB stock during 2023 compared to 5.98 during 2022. During fiscal 2023, the Bank purchased 1.3 million of required FHLB - San Francisco stock as a result of its increased borrowings. Interest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, increased 902,000, or 518 , to 1.1 million in fiscal 2023 from 174,000 in fiscal 2022, due to a higher average yield, partly offset by a lower average balance. The average yield increased 382 basis points to 4.05 in fiscal 2023 from 0.23 in fiscal 2022, resulting from increases in the targeted federal funds interest rate during fiscal 2023. Interest Expense. Total interest expense for fiscal 2023 was 9.0 million compared to 3.1 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 5.9 million or 187 . This increase was primarily attributable to a higher interest expense on borrowings and, to a lesser extent, a higher interest expense on deposits, particularly time deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.80 during fiscal 2023, up 50 basis point from 0.30 during fiscal 2022, and the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.12 billion during fiscal 2023, up 72.2 million or 7 from 1.05 billion during fiscal 2022. Interest expense on deposits for fiscal 2023 was 3.1 million compared to 1.1 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.0 million, or 175 . The increase in interest expense on deposits was attributable to a higher average cost, particularly for time deposits, partly offset by a decrease in average balance. The average cost of deposits increased 21 basis points to 0.33 in fiscal 2023 from 0.12 in fiscal 2022. The average cost of transaction accounts remained at 0.05 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, while the average cost of time deposits in fiscal 2023 was 1.70 , up 113 basis points, from 0.57 in fiscal 2022. The average balance of deposits decreased slightly to 960.9 million during fiscal 2023 from 961.5 million during fiscal 2022. The average balance of transaction accounts decreased 31.3 million, or 4 , to 798.7 million in fiscal 2023 from 830.0 million in fiscal 2022. The average balance of time deposits increased by 30.6 million, or 23 , to 162.1 million in fiscal 2023 from 131.5 million in fiscal 2022. Interest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB - San Francisco advances, for fiscal 2023 increased 3.9 million, or 194 , to 5.9 million as compared to 2.0 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in interest expense on borrowings was due to a higher average balance and a higher average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased 72.8 million, or 84 ,

Table of Contents 
 to 159.7 million during fiscal 2023 from 86.9 million during fiscal 2022. The average cost of borrowings was 3.67 in fiscal 2023, up 138 basis points from 2.29 in fiscal 2022. Provision (Recovery) for Loan Losses. During fiscal 2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of 374,000, compared to a recovery from the allowance for loan losses of 2.5 million during fiscal 2022. The provision reflected in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a higher outstanding balance of loans held for investment, while the recovery from the allowance for loan losses in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an improvement in the qualitative component adjustment to the allowance for loan losses reflecting improved general economic conditions and recoveries from the allowance for loan losses from non-performing loans and classified loans that were upgraded or paid off, partly offset by an increase in loans held for investment. Non-performing assets, comprised solely of non-performing loans (net of the collectively evaluated allowances and individually evaluated allowances) during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, was 1.3 million at June 30, 2023, down 123,000 or 9 from 1.4 million at June 30, 2022. Non-performing loans at June 30, 2023 were comprised of six single-family loans on non-accrual. As of June 30, 2023, 175,000 or 13 of the non-performing loans have a current payment status. Net loan recoveries in fiscal 2023 were 8,000 or 0.00 of average loans receivable, compared to net loan recoveries of 439,000 or 0.05 of average loans receivable in fiscal 2022. At both June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, there was no REO or accruing loans 90 days or more past due. Management believes, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment at June 30, 2023 under the incurred loss methodology. Commencing July 1, 2023, the Corporation will be calculating its allowance for credit losses on loans in accordance with the CECL methodology. For additional information, see Item 1, Business - Asset Quality in this Form 10-K. Non-Interest Income. Total non-interest income was 4.1 million in fiscal 2023, a decrease of 641,000 or 14 from 4.7 million in fiscal 2022, primarily attributable to a decrease in loan servicing and other fees. Loan servicing and other fees decreased 642,000, or 61 , to 414,000 for fiscal 2023 from 1.1 million in fiscal 2022, due primarily to lower loan prepayment fees, attributable to lower loan payoffs. Non-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense was 28.3 million in fiscal 2023, an increase of 2.4 million or 9 from 25.9 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits and premises and occupancy expenses. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 1.9 million, or 12 , to 17.7 million in fiscal 2023 from 15.8 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily due to a 1.2 million Employee Retention Tax Credit ERTC recorded in fiscal 2022 and not replicated in fiscal 2023, a 1.0 million increase in incentive compensation, a 387,000 increase in stock-based compensation resulting from the true-up adjustments associated with the vesting of the equity incentive awards, a 350,000 decrease in deferred loan fees recoveries (ASC 310), partly offset by a 1.3 million recovery from the Bank s obligations for the supplemental executive retirement plans. Premises and occupancy expense increased 258,000, or 8 , to 3.4 million in fiscal 2023 from 3.2 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher network services expenses, attributable to a refund of 136,000 in fiscal 2022 from a vendor on previously paid network services invoices that were overstated when paid and not replicated in fiscal 2023 and higher network services expenses in fiscal 2023 resulting from network upgrades. Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation and bank-owned life insurance policies, among others. Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax. The provision for income taxes was 3.8 million for fiscal 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 30.8 , similar to 3.8 million in fiscal 2022, representing an effective tax rate of 29.3 . The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was attributable primarily to a decrease in the tax benefit realized from the equity incentive awards with the share price lower

 at vesting and distribution than the fair value estimated on the grant date, while the effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 was impacted by the non-taxable treatment of the lower ERTC for state tax purposes (not replicated in fiscal 2023). The Corporation s effective tax rate may differ from the estimated tax rates described above due to discrete items such as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items. The Corporation determined that the above tax rates meet its estimated income tax obligations.

For purposes of calculating volume, rate and rate/volume variances, non-performing loans were included in the weighted-average balance outstanding. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities, proceeds from FHLB - San Francisco advances, access to the discount window facility at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and access to the correspondent bank s federal funds facility. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The primary investing activity of the Bank has been the origination and purchase of loans held for investment. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank originated loans held for investment of 237.1 million and 299.8 million, respectively. In addition, the Bank purchased loans held for investment from other financial institutions in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 of 0 and 6.4 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had loan origination commitments totaling 2.4 million and 43.4 million, with undisbursed loan funds of 2.0 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The Bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments. The Bank s primary financing activity is gathering deposits. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the net (decrease) increase in deposits was (4.9 million) and 17.5 million, respectively. On June 30, 2023, time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less were 166.5 million. Historically, the Bank has been able to retain a significant percentage of its time deposits as they mature by adjusting deposit rates based upon the current interest rate environment. The Bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities. The Bank generally maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs. At June 30, 2023, total cash and cash equivalents were 65.8 million, or 4.9 of total assets. Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products and FHLB - San Francisco advances, the Bank may continue to rely on FHLB - San Francisco advances for part of its liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2023, the remaining financing availability at the FHLB - San Francisco was 287.9 million and the remaining available collateral was 468.6 million. In addition, the Bank has secured a 139.0 million discount window facility at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities. The Bank 
 61

 also has a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for 50.0 million which matures on June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the discount window facility or the federal funds facility with its correspondent bank. The total available borrowing capacity across all sources totals approximately 476.9 million at June 30, 2023. Regulations require the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank s average liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 decreased to 18.1 from 24.3 during the same quarter ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in the liquidity ratio was due primarily to the decrease in average qualifying liquid assets and the increase in average borrowings during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 in comparison to the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The Bank augments its liquidity by maintaining sufficient borrowing capacity at the FHLB - San Francisco, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and its correspondent bank. We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and modernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our markets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations. Based on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2024 we project expending approximately 1.8 million to 2.7 million for capital investment in property, plant and equipment. For additional information regarding our commitments, see Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Provident is a separate legal entity from the Bank and, on a stand-alone level, must provide for its own liquidity and pay its own operating expenses and cash dividends and stock repurchases. Provident s primary sources of funds consist of capital raised through dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. During fiscal 2023, the Corporation purchased 302,719 shares of the Corporation s common stock with a weighted average cost of 14.01 per share. As of June 30, 2023, there are 61,540 shares available for purchase under the Corporation s existing stock repurchase plan. The Corporation purchases the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions, the capital requirements of the Corporation, and available cash that can be allocated to the stock repurchase program, among other considerations. In addition, we currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is 0.14 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the Bank, and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during fiscal 2024 at this rate of 0.14 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 986,000 based on the number of our current outstanding shares as of June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023, Provident (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of approximately 3.7 million. The Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the OCC. Under the OCC s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. In addition, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., as a savings and loan holding company registered with the FRB, is required by the FRB to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the OCC requirements. Since the holding company has less than 3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the FRB expects the holding company s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. At June 30, 2023, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Under the prompt corrective action provisions, minimum ratios of 5.0 for Tier 1 Leverage Capital, 6.5 for CET1 Capital, 8.0 for Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and 
 62 

Table of Contents 
 10.0 for Total Risk-based Capital are required to be deemed well capitalized. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank exceeded the capital ratios needed to be considered well capitalized with Tier 1 Leverage Capital, CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Risk-based Capital and Total Risk-based Capital ratios of 9.6 , 18.5 , 18.5 and 19.4 , respectively. See also, Regulation Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions Capital Requirements and Note 9, Capital of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Items 1 and 8 of this Form 10-K, respectively. Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements Various elements of the Corporation s accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, as a result of the judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are important to gain an understanding of the financial statements of the Corporation. These policies relate to the methodology for the recognition of interest income, determination of the provision and allowance for loan losses, the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments and the valuation of mortgage servicing assets and real estate owned. These policies and judgments, estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the section entitled Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time. However, because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these accounting policies, changes to the judgments, estimates and assumptions used could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Quantitative Aspects of Market Risk. The Corporation does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument nor does it purchase high-risk derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Corporation is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk. The primary market risk that the Corporation faces is interest rate risk. For information regarding the sensitivity to interest rate risk of the Corporation s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, see Interest Rate Risk below and Item 1, Business - Lending Activities - Maturity of Loans Held for Investment, - Investment Securities Activities, and - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Time Deposits by Remaining Maturity in this Form 10-K. Interest Rate Risk. One of the Corporation s principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The Corporation, through the Corporation s Asset-Liability Committee, has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation s interest-earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions. In addition, the Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, which is largely comprised of U.S. government agency MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently or have a relatively short-average life. The Corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing brokered certificates of deposit and FHLB - San Francisco advances as secondary sources of funding. Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered certificates of deposit, reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds. As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to seven years. For additional information, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. Through the use of an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the change in net portfolio value NPV over a variety of interest rate scenarios. NPV is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. The calculation is intended to illustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -300, -200, -100, +100, +200 and +300 basis points bp with no effect given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movement. As of June 30, 2023, the targeted federal funds rate range was 5.00 to 5.25 .

 The following table sets forth as of June 30, 2023 the estimated changes in NPV based on the indicated interest rate environment (dollars in thousands):

 (2) Calculated as the NPV divided by the portfolio value of total assets.
 (3) Calculated as the change in the NPV ratio (NPV as a Percentage of Portfolio Value Assets) from the base case amount assuming the indicated change in interest rates (expressed in basis points).
 The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a -200 basis point rate shock at June 30, 2023 and -100 basis point rate shock at June 30, 2022: 

At June 30, 2023 At June 30, 2022 (-200 bp rate shock) (-100 bp rate shock) Pre-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a of PV Assets 9.29 8.87 Post-Shock NPV Ratio: NPV as a of PV Assets 8.37 8.54 Sensitivity Measure: Change in NPV Ratio -92 bp -33 bp The pre-shock NPV ratio increased 42 basis points to 9.29 (-200 basis point rate shock) at June 30, 2023 from 8.87 (-100 basis point rate shock) at June 30, 2022, while the post-shock NPV ratio decreased 17 basis points to 8.37 (-200 basis point rate shock) at June 30, 2023 from 8.54 (-100 basis point rate shock) at June 30, 2022. The decrease of the NPV ratios was primarily attributable to increases in market interest rates and a 9.5 million cash dividend distribution from the Bank to the Corporation in September 2022, partly offset by the net income in fiscal 2023 and amortization of stock-based compensation. The sensitivity measure increased to 92 basis points at June 30, 2023 from 33 basis points at June 30, 2022. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as ARM loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above. It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults. Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates. Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation. The Corporation measures and evaluates the potential effects of interest rate movements through an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis. Interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income when there is movement in interest rates. For loans, securities and liabilities with contractual maturities, the table presents contractual repricing or scheduled maturity. For transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings deposits) that have no contractual

 maturity, the table presents estimated principal cash flows and, as applicable, the Corporation s historical experience, management s judgment and statistical analysis concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors. The following table represents the interest rate gap analysis of the Corporation s assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2023: 

Term to Contractual Repricing, Estimated Repricing, or Contractual Maturity (1) As of June 30, 2023 Greater than Greater than Greater than 12 months or 1 year to 3 3 years to 5 years or (Dollars In Thousands) less years 5 years non-sensitive Total Repricing Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 59,121 6,728 65,849 Investment securities 8,693 147,799 156,492 Loans held for investment 251,618 185,194 223,215 417,602 1,077,629 FHLB - San Francisco stock 9,505 9,505 Other assets 3,711 19,762 23,473 Total assets 332,648 185,194 223,215 591,891 1,332,948 Repricing Liabilities and Equity: Checking deposits - noninterest-bearing 103,006 103,006 Checking deposits - interest bearing 45,431 90,862 90,862 75,717 302,872 Savings deposits 58,041 116,082 116,081 290,204 Money market deposits 16,776 16,775 33,551 Time deposits 166,501 46,984 5,647 1,806 220,938 Borrowings 150,009 80,000 5,000 235,009 Other liabilities 1,737 15,944 17,681 Stockholders equity 129,687 129,687 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 438,495 350,703 217,590 326,160 1,332,948 Repricing gap positive (negative) (105,847) (165,509) 5,625 265,731 Cumulative repricing gap: Dollar amount (105,847) (271,356) (265,731) Percent of total assets (8) (20) (20) (1) Cash and cash equivalents are presented as estimated repricing; investment securities and loans held for investment are presented as contractual maturities or contractual repricing (without consideration for prepayments); FHLB - San Francisco stock is presented as contractual repricing; transaction accounts (checking, savings and money market deposits) are presented as estimated repricing; while time deposits (without consideration for early withdrawals) and borrowings are presented as contractual maturities. The static gap analysis under 12 months or less duration, Greater than 1 year to 3 years duration and Greater than 3 years to 5 years duration show negative positions in the Cumulative repricing gap - dollar amount category, indicating more liabilities are sensitive to repricing than assets in the short and intermediate terms. Management views noninterest-bearing deposits to be the least sensitive to changes in market interest rates and these accounts are therefore characterized as long-term funding. Interest-bearing checking deposits are considered more sensitive, followed by increased sensitivity for savings and money market deposits. For the purpose of calculating gap, a portion of these interest-bearing deposit balances are assumed to be subject to estimated repricing as follows: interest-bearing checking deposits at 15 per year, savings deposits at 20 per year and money market deposits at 50 in the first and second years. The gap results presented above could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the preparation of the gap analysis. Furthermore, the gap analysis provides a static view of

 interest rate risk exposure at a specific point in time without taking into account redirection of cash flows activity and deposit fluctuations. The extent to which the net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates will depend on a number of factors, including how quickly interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities react to interest rate changes. It is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in the market rates of interest. Additionally, prepayments of loans and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit could cause interest sensitivities to vary. As a result, the relationship between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as shown in the previous table, is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted solely on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the previous table. The Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end assuming a dynamic balance sheet accounting for, among other items: The Corporation s current balance sheet and repricing characteristics; Forecasted balance sheet growth consistent with the business plan; Current interest rates and yield curves and management estimates of projected interest rates; Embedded options, interest rate floors, periodic caps and lifetime caps; Repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments; Loan, investment, deposit and borrowing cash flows; Loan prepayment estimates for each type of loan; and Immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus 300, 200 and 100, minus 100, minus 200 and minus 300 basis points. The following table describes the results of the analysis at June 30, 2023 and 2022: 

At June 30, 2023 At June 30, 2022 Basis Point (bp) Change in Basis Point (bp) Change in Change in Rates Net Interest Income Change in Rates Net Interest Income +300 bp -10.56 +300 bp 3.32 +200 bp -5.26 +200 bp 2.14 +100 bp -1.95 +100 bp 1.05 -100 bp 1.25 -100 bp -0.09 -200 bp -0.59 -200 bp -3.28 -300 bp -3.33 -300 bp -7.71 At June 30, 2023, the Corporation was liability sensitive as its interest-bearing liabilities are expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-earning assets during the subsequent 12-month period. Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period at the -100 basis point scenario and a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period for the -200 and -300 basis point scenarios. At June 30, 2022, the Corporation was asset sensitive as its interest-earning assets were expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12-month period. Therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. In a falling interest rate environment, the results project a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. Management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable. However, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur. Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast. Therefore,

 the model results that the Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporation s current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Please refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and incorporated into this Item 8 by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures a) An evaluation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) and the Corporation s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on their evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023 are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. b) There have been no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. The Corporation does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting This management report includes the subsidiary institution of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (the Corporation ), Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. which is subject to Part 363 in the statement of management s responsibilities; the report on management s assessment of compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; and the report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Management of the Corporation is responsible for preparing the Corporation s annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP); and for complying with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions. The Corporation s internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Corporation designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management s assessment of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting was also conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), which include controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP). Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of regulatory financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Parent Company Only Financial Statements for Small Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9SP), is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management of the Corporation has assessed the Corporation s compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions during the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2023. Management has concluded that the Corporation complied with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions during the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2023.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors ofProvident Financial Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Holdings and subsidiary (the Corporation as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Corporation is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Loans Held for Investment - Allowance for Loan Losses Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description Management estimates the Corporation s allowance for loan losses ALL for the probable losses inherent in loans held for investment, segregating collectively evaluated allowances and individually evaluated allowances for loans. The total estimate was 5.9 million at June 30, 2023. The determination of the appropriate ALL inherently involves a high degree

 of subjectivity and requires significant estimates of the existing credit risks using both quantitative and qualitative analyses. For the collectively evaluated allowances, the Corporation uses historical experience to develop quantitative loss factors, which it applies to these loans based on management s assigned internal risk ratings. The Corporation also applies qualitative loss factors by assessing general economic indicators such as gross domestic product, retail sales, unemployment rates, employment growth, California home sales and median California home prices, as well as peer group data, reflecting the effect of events that have occurred but are not yet evidenced in the historical data. Auditing the collectively evaluated loans of the Corporation s ALL, specifically management s qualitative loss factors for certain single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans, involved especially significant judgment. Given the significant judgments in determining these qualitative loss factors, performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates for these qualitative loss factors involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the qualitative loss factors for certain loan types described above included the following, among others: We performed inquiries and examined documentation to understand management s methodology and process in determining the ALL, including the key assumptions and relevant data utilized. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over type of loan, loan classification, and determination of the qualitative loss factors and management s review of the relevant qualitative loss factors. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the inputs used in the determination of the loss factors by selecting loans and through the reconciliation of the loan data testing to the ALL data inputs. We made a selection of loans and reviewed the supporting loan files, which includes borrower correspondence, payment history, property inspections, and status of current borrower-provided financial information, to evaluate the appropriateness of the loans classification considered as input to the ALL. We compared the Corporation s loan loss factors, with benchmark data obtained independently to assess whether the ALL is within a reasonable range for specific loan categories. We evaluated the Corporation s historical allowance estimation process by comparing the ALL recorded in historical periods to actual results . /s/ September 5, 2023 We have served as the Corporation s auditor since 2001.

, net of deferred taxes and other immaterial adjustments, resulting from a pretax increase to our allowance for credit losses of approximately million. The increase is primarily related to the difference between the historical incurred loss methodology currently utilized, as compared to estimating lifetime credit losses as required by the CECL standard. Additionally, we do not expect the adoption of CECL to result in a material impact to our held-to-maturity securities portfolio, which is primarily comprised of government agency mortgage-backed securities. ASU 2020-04: In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or other rate references expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU permits an entity to make necessary modifications to eligible contracts or transactions without requiring contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. In January 2021, ASU 2021-01 clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the changes in the interest rates used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment for derivative instruments that are being implemented as part of the market-wide transition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the discounting transition ). In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848. The FASB had originally included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the LIBOR would cease being published. In March 2021, it was announced that the intended cessation date of LIBOR would be extended to June 30, 2023. As a result, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 deferring the sunset date of Topic 848 from March 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Corporation is in the process of transitioning into other rate indices in accordance with the government agency guidelines. As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation had approximately million in loans held for investment with LIBOR indices. Beginning July 1, 2023, the Corporation is transitioning these loans to Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR indices. The Corporation is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU and does not anticipate a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.

Multi-family Commercial real estate Construction Other Commercial business loans Consumer loans Total loans held for investment, gross The Corporation has developed an internal loan grading system to evaluate and quantify the Bank s loans held for investment portfolio with respect to quality and risk. Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Corporation s loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses using quantitative and qualitative methods. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are individually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances. Quantitative loan loss factors are developed by determining the historical loss experience, expected future cash flows, discount rates and collateral fair values, among others. Qualitative loan loss factors are developed by assessing general economic indicators such as gross domestic product, retail sales, unemployment rates, employment growth, California home sales and median California home prices, as well as peer group data, reflecting the

These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loans held for investment, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and determination of the realizable value of the collateral securing the loans. Provisions (recoveries) for loan losses are charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels.

days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans. For loans that were modified from their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified in the Corporation s reports as restructured loans, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes days delinquent. The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying ASC 310, Receivables. For restructured loans that are less than days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses is segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing loans less than days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method. For non-performing commercial real estate loans, individually evaluated allowances are calculated based on their fair values and if their fair values are higher than their loan balances, allowances are required.

Generally, a loan is placed on non-accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest or if the loan is deemed impaired, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful. In addition, interest income is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured. A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected on a timely basis. Loans with a related allowance reserve have been individually evaluated for impairment using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less costs to sell to establish realizable value. This evaluation may identify a specific impairment amount needed or may conclude that no reserve is needed. Loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment are included in pools of homogeneous loans for evaluation of related allowance reserves.

Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Corporation s effective tax rate may differ from the estimated statutory tax rates described above due to discrete items such as further adjustments to net deferred tax assets, excess tax benefits derived from stock option exercises and non-taxable earnings from bank owned life insurance, among other items.

The Corporation analyzes the deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required based on the more-likely-than-not criteria that such assets will be realized principally through future taxable income. This criteria takes into account the actual earnings and the estimates of future profitability. The Corporation may carryback net federal tax losses to the preceding five taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had federal and state net tax loss carryforwards. Based on management s consideration of historical and anticipated future income before income taxes, as well as the reversal period for the items giving rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities, a valuation allowance was not considered necessary at June 30, 2023 and 2022 and management believes it is more likely than not the Corporation will realize its deferred tax asset. Retained earnings at June 30, 2023 and 2022 include approximately million (pre-1988 bad debt reserve for tax purposes) for which federal income tax of million has not been provided. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for federal income tax purposes are later used for purposes other than for bad debt losses, including distribution in liquidation, they will be subject to federal income tax at the then-current corporate tax rate. If those amounts are not so used, they will not be subject to tax even in the event the Bank were to convert its charter from a thrift to a bank. The Corporation files income tax returns for the United States and California jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the Bank s income tax returns through 1996 and the California Franchise Tax Board has audited the Bank through 1990. Also, the Internal Revenue Service completed a review of the Corporation s income tax returns for fiscal 2006 and 2007; and the California Franchise Tax Board completed a review of the Corporation s income tax returns for fiscal 2009 and 2010. Fiscal years of 2020 and thereafter remain subject to federal examination, while the California state tax returns for fiscal years 2019 and thereafter are subject to examination by state taxing authorities. It is the Corporation s policy to record any penalties or interest charges arising from federal or state taxes as a component of income tax expense. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were tax penalties and interest charges arising from federal or state taxes.

The Corporation s contribution to the ESOP plan is discretionary. During fiscal 2023, there were shares that were purchased in the open market to fulfill the annual discretionary allocation. This compares to fiscal 2022 when the Corporation purchased shares in the open market and made in cash contributions to fulfill the annual discretionary allocation. Since the annual contributions are discretionary, the benefits payable under the ESOP cannot be estimated. Benefits generally become vested after of credited service. Vesting accelerates upon retirement, death or disability of the participant or in the event of a change in control of the Corporation. Forfeitures are reallocated among remaining participating employees in the same proportion as contributions. Benefits are payable upon death, retirement, early retirement, disability or separation from service.

The options are exercisable after vesting for up to the remaining term of the original grant. The maximum term of the options granted is . The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following assumptions as of the grant date for the periods indicated. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from historical common stock closing prices for the prior . The expected dividend yield is based on the most recent quarterly dividend on an annualized basis. The expected term is based on the historical experience of all fully vested stock option grants and is reviewed annually.

) As of June 30, 2022: Loans held for investment, at fair value ) ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: 

Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. ASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. The Corporation s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale, loans held for investment at fair value and interest-only strips; while non-performing loans and mortgage servicing assets MSA are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Investment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and private issue CMO. The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the private issue CMO (Level 3). Loans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale. The fair value is determined by management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan, in addition to the quoted secondary-market prices which account for the interest rate characteristics of each loan (Level 3). Non-performing loans are loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or of the collateral pledged. The non-performing loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The fair value of a non-performing loan is

For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future cash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which such loans would be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices. Investment securities - held to maturity: The investment securities - held to maturity consist of time deposits at Community Reinvestment Act qualified minority financial institutions, U.S. SBA securities, U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise CMO. Due to the short-term nature of the time deposits, the principal balance approximated fair value (Level 2). For the U.S. SBA securities and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS and CMO, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement (Level 2). FHLB San Francisco stock: The carrying amount reported for FHLB San Francisco stock approximates fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock. Deposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based upon observable inputs, including rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand or estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation and management estimates of current market conditions. Borrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate on such borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. The Corporation generally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily utilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process.

EXHIBIT 13 2023 Annual Report to Stockholders 

 2023 Annual Report 

Message From the Chairman Dear Shareholders: I am pleased to forward our Annual Report for fiscal 2023 highlighting our financial results. Last year at this time, I wrote in the Chairman s Message that I was confident our strong financial foundation positions us well to face future challenges and to capitalize on opportunities as they develop. Little did I know at the time that the Company s strong financial foundation would be tested so soon by the unexpected banking industry turmoil earlier this year. I am happy to report that the Company did not experience any significant day-to-day operational disruptions. In fact, we grew the loan portfolio by approximately 15 percent over the course of the fiscal year despite becoming more conservative in the June 2023 quarter in response to the heightened liquidity concerns surrounding the banking industry. However, current general economic conditions do not seem to be improving and the Federal Open Market Committee has responded to higher inflation data by raising the federal funds rate to the highest level in 22 years and at the quickest pace in 40 years. This will surely suppress economic activity in the near term, as it is designed to do, and may be a precursor to a future recession or other economic dislocations. In any case, we believe our robust capital levels and conservative credit culture will continue to support the Company through any future economic disruptions. Fiscal 2023 Overall, our fiscal 2023 financial results, described in the following Financial Highlights, were similar to last year and much improved from the three prior fiscal years. Throughout fiscal 2023, operating conditions were unsettled with conflicting economic results such as high inflation, higher interest rates, and modest gross domestic product growth in contrast to low unemployment rates, strong jobs growth and higher wages. These conditions resulted in reasonable fundamental performance led by a higher net interest margin and net interest income offset by higher operating expenses but conditions became more challenging as the fiscal year progressed. Last year, I described that our fiscal 2023 Business Plan forecast disciplined growth in loans held for investment, growth in retail deposits (primarily core deposits), control of operating expenses, and sound capital management decisions. We experienced mixed results regarding these initiatives. Loan originations and purchases for the held for investment portfolio were 237.1 million in fiscal 2023, a 23 percent decrease from fiscal 2022 volume, but loan prepayments also declined this fiscal year and when combined with the loan origination and purchase volumes the activity resulted in a 15 percent increase in loans held for investment. However, core deposits decreased by 104.8 million or 13 percent at June 30, 2023 from the same date last year as a result of rising interest rates and the turmoil in the banking industry and were largely replaced with brokered certificates of deposit such that total deposits declined by just one percent. Operating expenses for fiscal 2023 increased by approximately four percent from the prior year (after adjusting for the Employee Retention Tax Credit in fiscal 2022) resulting from the inflationary environment. In addition, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.14 per share in fiscal 2023 while repurchasing approximately 303,000 shares of our common stock under the April 2022 stock repurchase plan. Our capital management activities resulted in a 100 percent distribution of fiscal 2023 net income. Fiscal 2024 Similar to fiscal 2023, we plan to emphasize measured growth in loans held for investment; the continued growth of core deposits; disciplined control of operating expenses where we continue to improve operating efficiencies; and sound capital management decisions. We currently plan to return capital to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and believe that maintaining our cash dividend is very important to shareholders. We also recognize that prudent capital returns through stock repurchase programs is an essential capital management tool that we will continue to use as a component of our capital management strategy. We remain committed to single-family, multi-family, and commercial real estate mortgage lending as our primary sources of asset growth and we will redeploy cash-flows from investment securities to support the growth of our loan portfolio. Somewhat different than prior years, we intend to diversify the sources of total deposits and expand our contingency funding plans. We believe that doing so will reduce the volatility risk of the deposit base and provide for alternative funding sources in the event the banking industry experiences similar stresses this year. This strategy is intended to improve core revenue, over time, through a higher net interest margin, higher net interest income and ultimately, coupled with the growth of the Company, an increase in net income all while reducing the liquidity risk embedded in the balance sheet. A Final Word Recently, I came across a quote that resonated with me and crystalized my thoughts regarding our task at hand particularly when I think about the challenges of the past few years. Don t accept the Paradise syndrome. You have to run your business in good times and bad, no matter what the economy, or the market, or the weather is doing. 1 I want to assure you that we understand operating conditions are not always paradise. In fact, perfect operating conditions are seldom experienced and if they are they are fleeting. We adjust our operating strategies on an ongoing basis to overcome challenging conditions but not in a way that jeopardizes our long-term viability in exchange for short-term profitability, by moving too far out on the risk curve, or by depreciating our franchise value. We will not move away from our community banking roots or from serving the families and small businesses of the Inland Empire, moreover we will celebrate and expand on that heritage. In closing, I would like to recognize and thank our staff of banking professionals and Directors for their dedication to Provident. I would also like to express my appreciation to our customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve. To all of you, thank you for your continued patronage and support. We recognize that our continued success is inextricably linked to each of you and is dependent upon your ongoing goodwill. 

Sincerely,
