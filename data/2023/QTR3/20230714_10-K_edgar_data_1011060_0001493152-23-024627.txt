Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This
Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (the Litigation Reform Act ). These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our
beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available. 

The
words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, 
 should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements
reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or
more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions. 

In
accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act, we are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because
they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report on Form 10-K. For example, given the cessation of
our operations as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020, resulting from the sale of
substantially all of our assets to an independent third party, we became engaged in efforts to identify an operating company to acquire
or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction whereby such a transaction would likely result in a change in control. If
we are unable to effect a transaction with an operating company, we may be required to cease all operations, including liquidation through
bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein,
which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise except as required by law. 

Corporate
History 

We
were founded in 1993 as a subsidiary of PolyMedica Corporation PolyMedica ). In June 1996, PolyMedica distributed all of
the shares of CardioTech International, Inc. s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, which PolyMedica owned, to PolyMedica stockholders
of record. We were engaged in the business of developing advanced polymer materials for use in medical devices designed for treating
a broad range of anatomical sites and disease states. In July 1999, we acquired the assets of Tyndale-Plains-Hunter TPH ),
a manufacturer of specialty hydrophilic polyurethanes. 

In
April 2001, we acquired Catheter and Disposables Technology, Inc. CDT ), a contract manufacturer of advanced disposable
medical devices. In April 2003, we acquired Gish Biomedical, Inc. Gish ), a manufacturer of single use cardiopulmonary
bypass products. In the development of our business model, we reviewed the strategic fit of our various business operations and determined
that CDT and Gish did not fit our strategic direction. Gish was sold in July 2007 and CDT was sold in March 2008. 

Effective
October 26, 2007, pursuant to stockholder approval, we were reincorporated from a Massachusetts corporation to a Delaware corporation.
We changed our name from CardioTech International, Inc. to AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation, effective October 15, 2008. 

On
November 25, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement with Mitsubishi Chemical
Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation MCPP for the sale of substantially all of our assets for a total purchase
price of 7,250,000. The Asset Purchase Agreement was approved by our stockholders on January 21, 2020. As a result, we ceased operating
as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020 (the Closing Date ). Subsequent to the Closing Date,
we became engaged in efforts to identify an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction
or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in
a change in control. Although certain opportunities have been investigated to determine whether a potential merger or investment opportunity
could add value for the benefit of our shareholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements. 

3 

On
March 3, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, which amendment was unanimously
approved by our Board of Directors, to change our name AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation to EKIMAS Corporation. 

On
October 12, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Reddington Partners LLC, a California limited
liability company Reddington providing for the purchase of a total of 5,114,475 of our common stock, on a post-split
basis, or approximately 90 of our total shares of common stock outstanding for total cash consideration of 400,000. Reddington purchased
in two tranches on October 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company effectuated a 1-for 50 reverse stock split on March 11, 2022 (the Reverse Split ). Accordingly,
on a post-split basis, the shares purchased in connection with the First Closing resulted in Reddington owning 422,725 shares of our
common stock. As set forth in the SPA, Reddington then purchased from us on March 15, 2022, an additional 4,691,750 shares of our common
stock, on a post-split basis (the Second Closing ). After the issuance thereof Reddington owned 5,114,475 shares of our
common stock, or approximately 90 of our total shares of common stock outstanding. 

On
February 23, 2023, the Company and Nordicus Partners A/S, a Danish stock corporation, consummated the transactions contemplated by that
certain Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, Nordicus, GK Partners ApS GK
Partners ), Henrik Rouf and Life Science Power House ApS LSPH ). GK Partners, Rouf and LSPH are collectively referred
to herein as the Sellers , and each individually as a Seller ). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement the
Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned and conveyed to the Company all right, title and interest in and to one hundred percent (100 of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Nordicus for an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par
value 0.001 per share. As a result of the Business Combination, Nordicus became a 100 wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

On
May 17, 2023, the Company changed its name to Nordicus Partners Corporation and its ticker symbol to NORD.

over time.

5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

Prior
to August 1, 2020, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of The OTC Markets under the ticker symbol ASNB. Effective
August 1, 2020, we voluntarily downgraded to the OTC PINK tier of the OTC Markets. On May 17, 2023, the Company changed its name to Nordicus
Partners Corporation and its ticker symbol to NORD. 

Our
shares are subject to Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny stock 
rule. The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.
These rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of
shareholders to sell their shares. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors
must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of the security. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals
with assets in excess of 1,000,000 (not including their personal residence) or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together
with their spouse, and certain institutional investors. The rules require the broker-dealer to receive the purchaser s written
consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and require the broker-dealer to deliver a risk disclosure document relating to the
penny stock prior to the first transaction. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and
the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to customers disclosing
recent price information for the penny stocks. 

Holders 

As
of June 23, 2023, there were approximately 112 stockholders of record of our common stock, although we believe that there are other persons
who are beneficial owners of our common stock held in street name. The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Transfer
Online, 512 SE Salmon Street, Portland, OR 97214. Their telephone number is (503) 227-2950. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid cash or stock dividends and have no present plan to pay any dividends, intending instead to reinvest our earnings, if any.
For the foreseeable future, we expect to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and the payment of
any cash dividends on our common stock is unlikely.

Repurchase Plan 

In

stock. In June 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 500,000 shares of common stock. Since June 2001,
a total of 251,379 shares have been repurchased by us under the share repurchase program, leaving 498,621 shares remaining to purchase
under the share repurchase program. No repurchases were made during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. The share repurchase
program authorizes repurchases from time to time in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions, block transactions
or otherwise, at times and prices deemed appropriate by management, is not subject to an expiration date. 

Stockholder
Rights Plan 

Our
Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stockholder rights plan (the Rights Plan under which all stockholders of
record as of February 8, 2008 will receive rights to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock (the Rights ). The
Rights will be distributed as a dividend. Initially, the Rights will attach to, and trade with, our common stock. Subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations of the Rights Plan, the Rights will become exercisable if (among other things) a person or group acquires
15 or more of our common stock. Upon such an event, and payment of the purchase price, each Right (except those held by the acquiring
person or group) will entitle the holder to acquire shares of the Company s common stock (or the economic equivalent thereof) having
a value equal to twice the purchase price. Our Board of Directors may redeem the Rights prior to the time they are triggered. In the
event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire us, the Rights Plan is intended to facilitate the full realization of our stockholder value
and the fair and equal treatment of all of our stockholders. The Rights Plan will not prevent a takeover attempt. Rather, it is intended
to guard against abusive takeover tactics and encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with the Board of Directors. We did
not adopt the Rights Plan in response to any particular proposal.

a decrease of 17,577 or 14.7 . The decrease is largely due to a decrease of accounting fees. 

For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we had consulting fees of 39,602 compared to 105,565 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022,
a decrease of 65,963 or 62.5 . The decrease is largely due to a decrease of consulting fees for our prior CEO. 

For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we had general and administrative expenses of 196,500 compared to 83,743 for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2022, an increase of 112,757 or 134.6 . The increase in G A expense is mainly due to
the expense related to a cash distribution of 141,693. 

Other
Income 

For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we had interest expense of 382 and other income of 8,055, for total other income of 7,673. For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we had other income of 22,000, from a cash deposit in connection with a non-binding arrangement. 

Net
Loss 

For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we had a net loss of 8,472,216 compared to 287,171 in the prior year. The large increase
in our net loss in the current fiscal year is due to the non-cash expense we incurred as discussed above. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As
of March 31, 2023, we had cash of 7,149, a decrease of 238,796 when compared with a balance of 245,945 as of March 31, 2022. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we had net cash of 368,347 used in operating activities compared to 282,381 used in operating
activities in the prior year. 

There
was no cash used in or provided by investing activities during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, net cash of 128,886 provided by financing activities. We received 115,000 from the exercise
of warrants and 13,886 from a related party. We received and repaid a 40,000 loan payable. 

8 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we had net cash of 400,000 provided by financing activities which was a result of the issuance
of an additional 5,114,475 shares of our common stock to a private investor in consideration of 400,000 in cash. 

Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we reported a net loss of approximately
 8,472,000 and 287,000, respectively. Cash flows of approximately 368,000 and 282,000 were used in operations for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result, we expect our funds will not be sufficient to meet our needs for
more than twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Accordingly, management believes there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of March 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future
material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Nordicus Partners 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Nordicus Partners Corporation and Subsidiary the Company as of March 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for
the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has not generated revenue, incurred losses since inception, and has an accumulated deficit.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Nordicus Partners Corporation (F/K/A EKIMAS Corporation) (the Company) as of March 31,
2022, and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2022, and the

material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the year ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring losses and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note
2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Related
Party Transactions 

The
Company has significant related party transactions with and balances due to related parties. One of the former executive officers and
the current chief executive officer of the company are providing services to the Company as consultants for legal and accounting services.
We addressed significant related party transactions by testing and reviewing documentation of individual transactions. 

Evaluating
the identification of related party transactions was complex as it involved our assessment to determine such transactions were identified
by the Company. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021.

 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 MARCH
31, 2023 

pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement entered into between us and Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware
corporation MCPP ). Prior to the Closing Date, we developed and manufactured advanced polymer materials which provided
critical characteristics in the design and development of medical devices. Our biomaterials were marketed and sold to medical device
manufacturers who used our advanced polymers in devices designed for treating a broad range of anatomical sites and disease states. 

As
a result of the Asset Sale, we ceased operating as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers. Subsequent to
the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify either an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based
exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would
likely result in a change in control. On October 12, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Reddington
Partners LLC, a California limited liability company Reddington providing for the purchase of a total of of
our common stock, on a post-split basis, or approximately of our total shares of common stock outstanding for total cash consideration
of . Reddington purchased in two tranches on October 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022. 

On
March 3, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, which amendment was unanimously
approved by our Board of Directors, to change our name AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation to EKIMAS Corporation. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company effectuated a on March 11, 2022 (the Reverse Split ). Accordingly,
on a post-split basis, the shares purchased in connection with the First Closing resulted in Reddington owning shares of our
common stock. As set forth in the SPA, Reddington then purchased from us on March 15, 2022, an additional shares of our common
stock, on a post-split basis (the Second Closing ). After the issuance thereof Reddington owned shares of our
common stock, or approximately of our total shares of common stock outstanding. 

On
February 23, 2023, the Company and Nordicus Partners A/S, a Danish stock corporation, consummated the transactions contemplated by that
certain Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, Nordicus, GK Partners, Henrik Rouf
and Life Science Power House ApS LSPH ). GK Partners, Rouf and LSPH are collectively referred to herein as the Sellers ,
and each individually as a Seller ). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement the Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned
and conveyed to the Company all right, title and interest in and to one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Nordicus for an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share. As a result of
the Business Combination, Nordicus became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

On
May 17, 2023, the Company changed its name to Nordicus Partners Corporation and its ticker symbol to NORD. 

cash equivalents for the years ended March 31, 2023 or 2022. 

The
carrying amount of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate
their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company s notes payable approximate the fair value of
such instruments based upon management s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial
arrangements on March 31, 2023 and 2022. 

potentially dilutive shares of common stock from warrants. There were potentially
dilutive shares for the year ended March 31, 2022. Diluted shares are not presented when the effect of the computations are anti-dilutive
due to the losses incurred. Accordingly, there is no difference in the amounts presented for basic and diluted loss per share. 

as of March 31, 2023. As a result,
we expect our funds will not be sufficient to meet our needs for more than twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial
statements. Accordingly, management believes there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s recent acquisition, its generating profitable operations
in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand,
loans from third parties and/or private placement of common stock. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

stock as of March 31, 2022. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, Mr. Adams earned and , respectively, in

(the Affiliate ). We recorded legal fees paid to the Affiliate of and for the fiscal years ended March 31,

Closing ). At the First Closing, the Principal Stockholders entered into the Voting Agreements with Reddington, covering an aggregate
of shares of our common stock, on a pre-split basis. As a result of these transactions, Reddington obtained ownership or voting
power over a total of shares of our common stock, on a pre-split basis, constituting approximately of our total outstanding
shares. Accordingly, Reddington became the majority stockholder of the Company. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company effectuated a on March 11, 2022 (the Reverse Split ). Accordingly,
on a post-split basis, the shares purchased in connection with the First Closing resulted in Reddington owning shares of our

March 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately that may be offset against future taxable
income. NOLs from tax years up to 2017 can be carried forward twenty years. Under the CARES Act, the Company can carry forward NOLs indefinitely
for NOLs generated in a tax year beginning after 2017, that remain after they are carried back to tax years in the five-year carryback
period. No tax benefit has been reported in the March 31, 2023, financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation
allowance of the same amount. 

Due
to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting
purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to
use in future years. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by
tax authorities for years before 2016.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of March 31, 2023. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosure.
It should be noted that any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met and that management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to limited resources
in the finance and accounting functions. If successful in effecting a transaction with an operating company, we intend to take appropriate
and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the interim or annual
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023, based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
as of March 31, 2023, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to
limited resources in the finance and accounting functions. If successful in effecting a transaction with an operating company, we
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate these deficiencies. 

This
annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to Securities and Exchange Commission rules that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Section

of a registered class of our securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely on a review
