All references to the Company in this annual report on Form 10-K include the Registrant and its subsidiaries. Many of the amounts and percentages presented in this annual report on Form 10-K have been rounded for convenience of presentation. All references in this annual report on Form 10-K to 2023 and 2022 mean the Company s fiscal years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, unless the context otherwise indicates. PART I Item 1. Business AMREP Corporation was organized in 1961 as an Oklahoma corporation and, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States. The Company conducts a substantial portion of its business in Rio Rancho, New Mexico Rio Rancho and certain adjoining areas of Sandoval County, New Mexico. Rio Rancho is the third largest city in New Mexico with a population of approximately 108,000. Land Development As of April 30, 2023, the Company owned approximately 17,000 acres in Sandoval County, New Mexico. The Company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped real property to national, regional and local homebuilders, commercial and industrial property developers and others. Activities conducted or arranged by the Company include land and site planning, obtaining governmental and environmental approvals entitlements ), installing utilities and storm drains, ensuring the availability of water service, building or improving roads necessary for land development and constructing community amenities. The Company develops both residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use as demand warrants. Engineering work is performed by both the Company s employees and outside firms, but development work is generally performed by outside contractors. The Company also provides limited landscaping services, generally servicing homebuilders and homeowners associations. The Company markets land for sale or lease both directly and through brokers. With respect to residential development, the Company generally focuses its sales efforts on a limited number of homebuilders, with 95 of 2023 developed residential land sale revenues having been made to four homebuilders. The number of new construction single-family residential starts in Rio Rancho by the Company, the Company s customers and other builders was 585 in 2023 and 876 in 2022. The development of residential, commercial and industrial properties requires, among other things, financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available. The Company opportunistically acquires land, focusing primarily in New Mexico, after completion of market research, soil tests, environmental studies and other engineering work, a review of zoning and other governmental requirements, discussions with homebuilders or other prospective end-users of the property and financial analysis of the project and estimated development costs. The continuity and future growth of the Company s real estate business, if the Company pursues such growth, will require that the Company acquire new properties in New Mexico or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate business. The Company competes with other owners and developers of land that offer for sale developed and undeveloped residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use.

The following table presents information on the large land development projects of the Company in New Mexico as of April 30, 2023: 

Developed 1 Under Development 2 Commercial Commercial Residential / Industrial Residential / Industrial Undeveloped 3 Lots Acres Acres Acres Acres Lomas Encantadas 103 198 6 Hawk Site 89 103 129 Hawk Adjacent 44 Enchanted Hills/ Commerce Center 29 Papillon 308 Paseo Gateway 290 La Mirada 7 2 Lomas Encantadas is located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in Rio Rancho. Hawk Site and Hawk Adjacent are located in the northern section of Unit 25 in Rio Rancho. Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center is located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in Rio Rancho. Papillon is located in the northern section of Unit 25 in Rio Rancho. Paseo Gateway is located in the southern section of Unit 20 in Rio Rancho. La Mirada is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The following table presents information on certain small residential land development projects of the Company in New Mexico as of April 30, 2023: 

Developed 1 Under Development 2 Lots Acres Location Lavender Fields 15 Bernalillo County, New Mexico Vista Entrada 6 Eastern section of Unit 20 in Rio Rancho Tierra Contenta 30 Santa Fe, New Mexico GeoPark 8 Santa Fe, New Mexico Northern Meadows J-1 3 Southern section of Unit 22 in Rio Rancho In addition to the property listed in the tables above, as of April 30, 2023, the Company held undeveloped property in Sandoval County, New Mexico of approximately 16,000 acres in high contiguous ownership areas and low contiguous ownership areas. High contiguous ownership areas may be suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for development under the auspices of local government. Low contiguous ownership areas may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or may be offered for sale individually or in small groups. Infrastructure Reimbursement Mechanisms . A portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills subdivision are subject to a public improvement district. The public improvement district reimburses the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district. 

 1 Developed lots/acreage are any tracts of land owned by the Company that have been entitled with infrastructure work that is substantially complete. 2 Acreage under development is real estate owned by the Company for which entitlement or infrastructure work is currently being completed. However, there is no assurance that the acreage under development will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. In addition, the mix of residential and commercial acreage under development may change prior to final development. The development of this acreage will require significant additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available. 3 There is no assurance that undeveloped acreage will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. Undeveloped acreage is real estate that can be sold as is (e.g., where no entitlement or infrastructure work has begun on such property). 
 2 

The Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants in Lavender Fields and on a portion of the property in Hawk Site. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subject property by imposing an assessment on the real property owners subject to the covenants. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the private infrastructure reimbursement covenants. Impact fees are charges or assessments payable by homebuilders to local governing authorities in order to generate revenue for funding or recouping the costs of capital improvements or facility expansions necessitated by and attributable to the new development. The Company receives credits, allowances and offsets applicable to impact fees in connection with certain off-site costs incurred by the Company in developing subdivisions, which the Company generally sells to homebuilders. Commercial Property . Out of the eight commercial lots in the La Mirada subdivision, the Company sold four of the commercial lots in 2023 and two of the commercial lots in 2022. As of April 30, 2023, the Company is in the process of constructing a 2,800 square foot single tenant building on a commercial lot in the La Mirada subdivision and a 2,800 square foot single tenant building on a commercial lot in Unit 10 in Rio Rancho. In 2022, the Company also sold approximately 1.8 acres of commercial property in the Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center subdivision. Mineral Rights . The Company owns certain minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately 55,000 surface acres of land in Sandoval County, New Mexico. Other Real Estate Interests . The Company owns an approximately 160-acre property in Brighton, Colorado planned for 410 homes. In 2022, the Company sold its approximately 5-acre property in Parker, Colorado and 143,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida. Homebuilding In fiscal year 2020, the Company commenced operations in New Mexico of its internal homebuilder, Amreston Homes. The Company offers a variety of home floor plans and elevations at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to meet the needs of homebuyers. The Company focuses on selling single-family detached and attached homes. The Company selects locations for homebuilding based on available land inventory and completion of a feasibility study. The Company utilizes internal and external sales brokers for home sales. Model homes are generally used to showcase the Company s homes and their design features. The Company provides built-to-order homes where construction of the homes does not begin until the customer signs the purchase agreement and speculative spec homes for homebuyers that require a home within a short time frame. Sales contracts with homebuyers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes. Sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides homebuyers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at specified interest rates within a specified period. Contracts may also include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. The construction of homes is conducted under the supervision of the Company s on-site construction field managers. Most construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreed-upon price. Although the Company does not yet have sufficient historical experience to observe any seasonal effect on sales and construction activities, the Company does expect some seasonality in sales and construction activities which can affect the timing of closings. But any such seasonal effect on sales is expected to be relatively insignificant compared to the effect of the timing of opening of a property for sale and the subsequent timing of closings. The housing industry in New Mexico is highly competitive. Numerous national, regional and local homebuilders compete for homebuyers on the basis of location, price, quality, reputation, design and community amenities. This competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes the Company delivers or cause the Company to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume. The Company also competes with resales of existing homes and available rental housing. Increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes. Materials and Labor During 2023 and 2022, the Company experienced supply chain constraints, increases in the prices of building materials, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. Generally, construction materials for the Company s operations are available from numerous sources. However, the cost and availability of certain building materials, especially lumber, steel, concrete, copper and petroleum-based materials, is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices and capacity as well as government regulation, such as government-imposed tariffs or trade restrictions on supplies such as steel and lumber. The ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply

growth has not kept pace with construction demand. To partially protect against changes in construction costs, labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with homebuilders or homebuyers. However, the Company cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future. Regulatory and Environmental Matters The Company s operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal, state and local governing authorities. These regulations are complex and include building codes, land zoning and other entitlement restrictions, health and safety regulations, labor practices, marketing and sales practices, environmental regulations and various other laws, rules and regulations. The applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations. The Company may experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay anticipated development and construction activities. Government restrictions, standards and regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts may result in restrictions on land development or homebuilding in certain areas and may increase energy, transportation or raw material costs, which could reduce the Company s profit margins and adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Weather conditions and natural disasters can harm the Company. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, delay or increase costs of land development or damage homes or land development under construction. These matters may result in delays, may cause the Company to incur substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict land development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas. Human Capital Resources As of April 30, 2023, the Company employed 28 full-time employees. The Company believes the people who work for the Company are its most important resource and are critical to the Company s continued success. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support the Company s operations. The Company strives to reward employees through competitive industry pay, benefits and other programs; instill the Company s culture with a focus on ethical behavior; and enhance employees performance through investments in technology, tools and training to enable employees to operate at a high level. The Company s employees are not represented by any union. The Company considers its employee relations to be good. The Company offers employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and the Company believes its compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in the industry. All employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate ethical behavior. AVAILABLE INFORMATION The Company maintains a website at www.amrepcorp.com.

square foot office building in Rio Rancho owned by the Company. In addition, real estate inventory and investment properties are described in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K with certain mortgages associated with such real estate described in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company believes its facilities are adequate for its current requirements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending or threatened claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Information about the Company s Executive Officers Set forth below is certain information concerning persons who are the current executive officers of the Company. Christopher V. Vitale , age 47, has been a director of the Company since 2021 and has been President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company since 2017. From 2014 to 2017, Mr. Vitale was Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel of the Company and, from 2013 to 2014, he was Vice President and General Counsel of the Company. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Vitale held various legal positions at Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., a national sponsor and distributor of investment products, from 2011 to 2013 and at WorldGate Communications, Inc., a provider of digital voice and video phone services and video phones, from 2009 to 2011. Prior to joining WorldGate, Mr. Vitale was an attorney with the law firms of Morgan, Lewis Bockius LLP and Sullivan Cromwell LLP. Adrienne M. Uleau , age 55, has been Vice President, Finance and Accounting of the Company since March 2020. From August 2018 to March 2020, Ms. Uleau was Controller of the Company. Prior to joining the Company, Ms. Uleau had been Controller of United Tectonics Corp., a construction services company, from 2016 to August 2018. From 2014 to 2016, Ms. Uleau was Financial Manager of Cushman and Wakefield. Prior to 2014, Ms. Uleau held various accounting positions. The executive officers are elected or appointed by the board of directors of the Company or its appropriate subsidiary to serve until the appointment or election of their successors or their earlier death, resignation or removal. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The Company s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AXR . On July 7, 2023, there were 260 holders of record of the common stock. The Company s common stock is often thinly traded. As a result, large transactions in the Company s common stock may be difficult to execute in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the Company s common stock. Among other reasons, the stock is thinly traded due to the fact that four of the Company s shareholders beneficially owned approximately 55.8 of the outstanding common stock as of July 17, 2023 according to available information. The average trading volume in the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the thirty-day trading period ending on April 30, 2023 was 8,540 shares per day. The Company is an Oklahoma corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of its certificate of incorporation and of Oklahoma law generally prohibit the Company from engaging in business combinations with an interested shareholder, as those terms are defined therein, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the Company s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction. Consequently, the concurrence of the Company s largest shareholders would generally be needed for any interested shareholder to acquire control of the Company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the Company s other shareholders. Equity Compensation Plan Information See Item 12, which incorporates such information by reference from the Company s Proxy Statement for its 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Dividend Policy The Company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock since fiscal year 2008. The Company may consider dividends from time-to-time in the future in light of conditions then existing, including earnings, financial condition, cash position, capital requirements and other needs. No assurance is given that there will be any such future dividends declared. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations For a description of the Company s business, refer to Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K. As indicated in Item 1, the Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in two business segments: land development and homebuilding. The Company has no foreign sales. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements. The preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include: (1) land sale cost of revenues, net calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (2) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets and assets held for sale; (3) actuarially determined defined benefit pension obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures; (4) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (5) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas. Management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience, third-party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following: land sale cost of revenues, net are incurred throughout the life of a project, and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies, but not yet incurred; when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, a test for asset impairment may be required. Asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets, the grouping of those assets, the expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. For real estate projects under development, an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is determined using estimated future expenditures necessary to complete such projects and using management s best estimates about sales prices and holding periods. Testing of long-lived assets includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins, administrative expenses and terminal values. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a particular asset group is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material; defined benefit pension obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates, including the expected rate of investment return on pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities, and certain employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; the Company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities; and the Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projects its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of net deferred tax assets.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended April 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended April 30, 2022 For 2023, the Company had net income of 21,790,000, or 4.11 per diluted share, compared to net income of 15,862,000, or 2.21 per diluted share, in 2022. As discussed in more detail below, during 2023, the Company recognized a non-cash income tax benefit of 16,071,000 as a result of a worthless stock deduction related to its former fulfillment services business and a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement general and administrative expense of 7,597,000 due to (a) the Company s defined benefit pension plan paying certain lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and (b) the transfer of nearly all remaining pension benefit liabilities to an insurance company through an annuity purchase. During 2023 and 2022, the Company has experienced supply chain constraints, increases in the prices of building materials, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections in both the land development business segment and homebuilding business segment, which caused delays in construction and the realization of revenues and increases in cost of revenues. In addition, in response to inflation, the Federal Reserve increased benchmark interest rates during 2023 and 2022 and has signaled it expects additional future interest rate increases, which has resulted in a significant increase in mortgage interest rates during 2023 and 2022, impacting home affordability and consumer sentiment and tempering demand for new homes and finished residential lots. The rising cost of housing due to increases in average sales prices in recent years and the recent increases in mortgage interest rates, coupled with general inflation in the U.S. economy and other macroeconomic factors, have placed pressure on overall housing affordability and have caused many potential homebuyers to pause and reconsider their housing choices. Given the affordability challenges described above and the resulting impact on demand, the Company has increased sales incentives on certain homes classified as homebuilding model inventory or homebuilding construction in process, opportunistically leased completed homes and slowed the pace of housing starts and land development projects. The Company believes these conditions will continue to impact the land development and homebuilding industries for at least the remainder of calendar year 2023. Future economic conditions and the demand for land and homes are subject to continued uncertainty due to many factors, including the recent increase in mortgage interest rates, higher inflation, low supplies of new and existing home inventory available for sale, ongoing disruptions from supply chain challenges and labor shortages, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and government directives, and other factors. While construction and land costs remain elevated, the Company has been able to offset these cost increases through land and home price increases in 2023 and 2022 due to a strong pricing environment, which may not continue. The Company s past performance may not be indicative of future results. Revenues . The following presents information on revenues (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Increase (decrease) Land sale revenues 30,659 36,200 (5,541) (15) Home sale revenues 16,691 13,565 3,126 23 Building sales and other revenues 1,326 9,161 (7,835) (86) Total 48,676 58,926 (10,250) (17) The change in land sale revenues for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in revenue of developed commercial land and undeveloped land offset in part by an increase in revenue of developed residential land. The Company s land sale revenues consist of (dollars in thousands):

The Company sold 1,196 acres of contiguous undeveloped land in Sandoval County, New Mexico in 2022, representing 7,107,000 of revenue, to one purchaser. The Company does not expect the sale of a significant amount of undeveloped land in 2022 to be indicative of the sale of such undeveloped land in the future. The change in home sale revenues for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices offset in part by a decrease in the number of homes sold as a result of decreases in demand (including from the affordability challenges described above), supply chain constraints, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections. The Company s home sale revenues consist of (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Homes sold 32 41 Average selling price 525 331 As of April 30, 2023, the Company had 18 homes in production, including 10 homes under contract, which homes under contract represented 5,640,000 of expected home sale revenues when closed, subject to customer cancellations and change orders. As of April 30, 2022, the Company had 38 homes in production, including 17 homes under contract, which homes under contract represented 8,713,000 of expected home sale revenues when closed, subject to customer cancellations and change orders.

Sales of buildings during 2022 consisted of revenues from the sale of a 4,338 square foot, single tenant retail building in the La Mirada subdivision and from the sale of a 143,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida. The Company does not expect the sale of the warehouse and office facilities located in Palm Coast, Florida to be indicative of future sales of such properties since the Company has no other similar properties. Landscaping revenues consisted of landscaping services, generally servicing homebuilders and homeowners associations, provided by the Company. Miscellaneous other revenues for 2023 primarily consisted of extension fees for purchase contracts, forfeited deposits and residential rental revenues. Miscellaneous other revenues for 2022 primarily consisted of rent received from a tenant at a building in Palm Coast, Florida and tenants at a shopping center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a non-refundable option payment and proceeds from the sale of equipment. Cost of Revenues . The following presents information on cost of revenues (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Increase (decrease) Land sale cost of revenues, net 17,379 17,645 (266) (2) Home sale cost of revenues 12,037 10,237 1,800 18 Building sales and other cost of revenues 361 4,387 (4,026) (92) Total 29,777 32,269 (2,492) (8) Land sale cost of revenues, net consist of (in thousands): 

Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Land sale cost of revenues 22,477 21,198 Less: Public improvement district reimbursements (759) (558) Private infrastructure covenant reimbursements (626) (184) Payments for impact fee credits (3,713) (2,811) Land sale cost of revenues, net 17,379 17,645 Land sale gross margins were 42 for 2023 compared to 51 for 2022. The change in gross margin was primarily due to the location, size and mix of property sold (including the sale of 1,233.5 acres in 2022 versus 10.8 acres in 2023 of undeveloped land with a low associated land sale cost of revenues) offset in part by lower than estimated costs in 2022 associated with certain completed projects. As a result of many factors, including the nature and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land being sold, revenues, average selling prices and related gross margin from land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods. The change in home sale cost of revenues for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to location, size of homes, increases in the prices of building materials and shortages of skilled labor. Despite such increase in home sale cost of revenues, home sale gross margins were 28 for 2023 compared to 25 for 2022. The change in gross margin was primarily due to the location and mix of homes sold and to operational efficiencies. Building sales and other cost of revenues for 2023 consisted of cost of goods sold for landscaping services. Building sales and other cost of revenues for 2022 consisted of expenses associated with the sale of a 143,000 square foot warehouse and office facility located in Palm Coast, Florida and the sale of a 4,338 square foot, single tenant retail building in the La Mirada subdivision.

General and Administrative Expenses . The following presents information on general and administrative expenses (dollars in thousands): 

Year Ended April 30, 2023 2022 Increase (decrease) Operations Land development 2,843 3,258 (415) (13) Homebuilding 1,016 878 138 16 Corporate 1,613 1,218 395 32 Operations Total 5,472 5,354 118 2 Pension settlement 7,597 7,597 (a) (a) Percentage not meaningful. The change in land development general and administrative expenses for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a refund of certain property taxes. The Company did not record any non-cash impairment charges on real estate inventory or investment assets in 2023 or 2022. Due to volatility in market conditions and development costs, the Company may experience future impairment charges. The change in homebuilding general and administrative expenses for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to expansion of the Company s homebuilding operations. The change in corporate general and administrative expenses for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to increases in pension benefit expenses, payroll and professional services offset in part by decreases in office rent and expenses and depreciation. The pension settlement general and administrative expense was due to (a) the Company s defined benefit pension plan paying certain lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and (b) the transfer of nearly all remaining pension benefit liabilities to an insurance company through an annuity purchase. No such pension settlement general and administrative expense was incurred in 2022. 
 Interest Income (Expense) . Interest income (expense), net increased to 8,000 for 2023 from 2,000 for 2022. Interest and loan costs of 57,000 and 224,000 were capitalized in real estate inventory for 2023 and 2022. Other Income . Other income of 1,803,000 for 2023 consisted of the sale of all of the Company s minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately 147 surface acres of land in Brighton, Colorado. Other income of 261,000 for 2022 primarily consisted of 185,000 received in connection with the bankruptcy of a warranty provider, 45,000 of debt forgiveness with respect to a note payable and 30,000 received from a life insurance policy for a retired executive of the Company. Income Taxes . The Company had a benefit for income taxes of 14,149,000 for 2023 compared to a provision for income taxes of 5,704,000 for 2022. The benefit for income taxes for 2023 was primarily due to the income tax benefit related to the Company s worthless stock deduction offset in part by income taxes for the amount of income before income taxes during the year. The provision for income taxes for 2022 correlated to the amount of income before income taxes during the year. Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the Company s worthless stock deduction. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 19,993,000 and 15,721,000 as of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022. AMREP Corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a holding company, AMREP Corporation is dependent on its available cash and on cash from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations. The Company s liquidity is affected by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the real estate industry and the economy generally. The Company s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations, bank financing for specific real estate projects, a revolving line of credit and existing cash balances. Land and homebuilding properties generally cannot be sold quickly, and the ability of the Company to sell properties has been and will continue to be affected by market conditions. The ability of the Company to generate cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the timeframes the Company has established for each property. The development of additional lots 
 10 

for sale, construction of homes or pursuing other real estate projects may require financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms (or at all). If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, the Company s results of operations could be adversely affected. The Company expects the primary demand for funds in the future will be for the development and acquisition of land, construction of home and commercial projects and general and administrative expenses. The development and acquisition of land and construction of home and commercial projects is generally required to satisfy delivery obligations of developed land or finished homes to customers. Further, the Company regularly evaluates property available for purchase from third parties for possible acquisition and development by the Company. To the extent the sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet its needs, the Company may conduct public or private offerings of securities, dispose of certain assets or draw on existing or new debt facilities. The Company believes that it has adequate cash, bank financing and cash flows from operations to provide for its anticipated spending in fiscal year 2024. COVID-19 . Any epidemic, pandemic or similar serious public health issue, and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt or prevent the Company from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period. As a result, the impact of such public health issues and the related governmental actions could materially impact the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For instance, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, resulting in extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. These restrictions had an adverse impact on the Company beginning in the spring of 2020. As effective treatment and mitigation measures for COVID-19 advanced, economic activity gradually resumed and demand for new homes improved significantly. The effects of the pandemic on economic activity, combined with the strong demand for new homes, caused many disruptions to the Company s supply chain and shortages in certain building components and materials, as well as labor shortages. These conditions caused construction cycles to lengthen and while the Company s business is now fully functioning, some of those conditions continue to impact the Company s operations and financial performance. There is continuing uncertainty regarding how long COVID-19 and its resultant effect on the economy will continue to impact the Company s supply chain and operations. The Company s operational and financial performance could be impacted by a resurgence in the pandemic and any containment or mitigation measures put in place as a result of the resurgence, all of which are highly uncertain, unpredictable and outside the Company s control. If COVID-19 or any of its variants continues to have a significant negative impact on the economy, or if a new pandemic emerges, the Company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Pension Plan . The Company has a defined benefit pension plan for which accumulated benefits were frozen and future service credits were curtailed as of March 1, 2004. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company s defined benefit pension plan was overfunded as of April 30, 2023 by 747,000, with 1,030,000 of assets and 283,000 of liabilities, and was overfunded as of April 30, 2022 by 90,000, with 18,054,000 of assets and 17,964,000 of liabilities. The pension plan liabilities were determined using a weighted average discount interest rate of 4.51 per year as of April 30, 2023 and 3.97 per year as of April 30, 2022, which are based on the FTSE Pension Discount Curve as of such dates as it corresponds to the projected liability requirements of the pension plan. The pension plan is subject to minimum IRS contribution requirements, but these requirements can be satisfied by the use of the pension plan s existing credit balance. No cash contributions to the pension plan were required during 2023 or 2022 and the Company did not make any contributions to the pension plan during 2023 or 2022. The Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement general and administrative expense of 7,597,000 during 2023 due to (a) the Company s defined benefit pension plan paying certain lump sum payouts of pension benefits to former employees and (b) the transfer of nearly all remaining pension benefit liabilities to an insurance company through an annuity purchase.

Investing Activities . The net cash used in investing activities for each of 2023 and 2022 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of property and equipment, including the acquisition in 2022 of a 7,000 square foot office building in Rio Rancho from which the Company s real estate business now operates Financing Activities . The net cash used in financing activities for 2023 was primarily due to principal debt repayments. The net cash used in financing activities for 2022 was primarily due to the Company s share repurchase activity and principal debt repayments offset in part by the proceeds from debt financing. Notes payable decreased from 2,030,000 as of April 30, 2022 to 44,000 as of April 30, 2023, primarily due to principal debt repayments. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding each of the Company s notes payable. Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the Company s share repurchase activity.

Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding real estate inventory. From April 30, 2022 to April 30, 2023, the change in land inventory in New Mexico was primarily due to land development activity and the acquisition and sale of land, the change in homebuilding model inventory was primarily due to the sale of homes offset in part by the completion of homes not yet sold and the change in homebuilding construction in process was primarily due to supply chain constraints, shortages of skilled labor and delays in municipal approvals and inspections causing construction cycle time to lengthen. Investment assets, net consist of (dollars in thousands): 
 12 

April 30, 2023 2022 Increase (decrease) Land held for long-term investment 8,961 9,017 (56) (1) Owned real estate leased or intended to be leased 4,802 4,802 (a) Less accumulated depreciation (16) (16) (a) Owned real estate leased or intended to be leased, net 4,786 4,786 (a) Total 13,747 9,017 (a) Percentage not meaningful. Land held for long-term investment represents property located in areas that are not planned to be developed in the near term and that has not been offered for sale in the normal course of business. Owned real estate leased or intended to be leased represents homes and buildings leased or intended to be leased to third parties. As of April 30, 2023, eight homes are leased to residential tenants and two buildings under construction have been leased to commercial tenants. Given the impact on demand as a result of affordability challenges described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company has opportunistically leased completed homes. Depreciation associated with owned real estate leased or intended to be leased was 16,000 for 2023; there was no such depreciation in 2022. From April 30, 2022 to April 30, 2023: 
 o The change in other assets was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses related to a land development cash collateralized performance guaranty and stock compensation. o The change in deferred income taxes, net was primarily due to the income tax effect of the Company s worthless stock deduction offset in part by the income tax effect of the amount of income before income taxes during the year. Refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the Company s worthless stock deduction and refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for detail regarding the pension settlement general and administrative expense. o The change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the payment of invoices offset in part by an increase in customer deposits. o The change in taxes (receivable) payable, net was primarily due to the payment of taxes offset by the elimination of the current year tax provision. o The change in prepaid pension costs was primarily due to the funding levels of the Company s frozen defined benefit pension plan. The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of 5,743,000 for 2023 and 50,000 for 2022 reflecting the change in accrued pension costs during each period net of the related deferred tax and unrecognized prepaid pension amounts. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . As of April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K). Recent Accounting Pronouncements . Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. IMPACT OF INFLATION The Company s operations can be impacted by inflation. Inflation can cause increases in the cost of land, materials, services, interest rates and labor. Unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies, operating margins will decrease. The Company s homebuilding segment as well as homebuilders that are customers of the Company s land development business segment face inflationary concerns that rising housing costs, including interest costs, may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home. If this situation were to exist, the demand for homes produced by the Company s homebuilding segment could decrease and the demand for the Company s land by homebuilder customers could decrease. Although the rate of inflation has been historically low in recent years, 
 13 

it increased significantly in 2023 and 2022 and the Company has and is experiencing significant increases in the prices of labor and certain materials as a result of this increase and increased demand for new homes. Inflation may also increase the Company s financing costs. While the Company attempts to pass on to its customers increases in costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit the Company s ability to do so. If the Company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, the Company s revenues, gross margins and net income could be adversely affected.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibilities of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls, material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, even internal controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 based upon the criteria set forth in a report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of April 30, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was effective. This annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to such attestation pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the board of directors of AMREP Corporation and Subsidiaries: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AMREP Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company as of April 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Common Land Sale Cost of Revenues Critical Audit Matter Description As described in Notes 1, 2, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records common land sale cost of revenues based upon an allocation of certain common development costs associated with the entire project. Common development costs include the installation of utilities and roads and can be based upon estimates to complete. The allocation of these costs is based upon the estimates. These estimates and cost allocations are reviewed on a regular basis until a project is substantially completed, and may be revised and reallocated as necessary on the basis of current estimates. We identified common land sale cost of revenues as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes in allocating common land costs to individual parcels of real estate once sold. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from audit of the financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2022 that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Allocation of common development costs For the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company s land sale cost of revenues includes all direct acquisition costs and other costs specifically identified with the land and an allocation of common development costs associated with its land development projects. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, common development costs are allocated based on the estimated relative sales value of the individual parcels of land being sold to the total expected sales value for the unsold parcels of land in the applicable portion of the subdivision. At the time of the closings of the sales of individual land parcels, certain common development costs may not yet be incurred. To recognize the appropriate amount of cost of revenues, the Company estimates the total remaining common development costs associated with its land development projects. Estimates may be affected by changes to zoning laws, land development requirements and the cost of labor, material, and subcontractors. Auditing the Company s allocation of common development costs associated with its land development projects was complex and subject to sensitive management assumptions. To test the Company s allocation of common development costs associated with its land development projects, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated costs to complete the land development

The option will become exercisable for of the option shares on November 1, 2026 if Mr. Vitale is employed by, or providing service to, the Company on such date. Subject to the definitions in the Equity Plan, in the event (a) Mr. Vitale has a termination of employment with the Company on account of death or disability, (b) the Company terminates Mr. Vitale s employment with the Company for any reason other than cause or (c) of a change in control, then the option will become immediately exercisable for of the option shares. The option has a term of from the date of grant and terminates at the expiration of that period. The option automatically terminates upon: (i) the expiration of the period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if the termination of his employment by Mr. Vitale or the Company is for any reason other than as hereinafter set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv); (ii) the expiration of the period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company on account of Mr. Vitale s disability; (iii) the expiration of the period after Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if Mr. Vitale dies while employed by the Company; or (iv) the date on which Mr. Vitale ceases to be employed by the Company, if the termination is for cause. If Mr. Vitale engages in conduct that constitutes cause after Mr. Vitale s employment terminates, the option immediately terminates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may the option be exercised after the date that is immediately before the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Except as described above, any portion of the option that is not exercisable at the time Mr. Vitale has a termination of employment with the Company immediately terminates. The fair value of the option was as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes fair value option valuation model. The following assumptions were used for determining the fair value of the option: expected volatility of ; average risk-free interest rate of ; dividend yield of ; and expected life of years. As of April 30, 2023, the option has not been exercised, cancelled or forfeited. The Company recognized non-cash compensation expense related to the option of and during 2023 and 2022. As of April 30, 2023, the option was out-of-the-money and therefore was not included in weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted when calculating diluted earnings per share. The option could be dilutive to earnings per share in the future. As of April 30, 2022, the option was out-of-the-money and therefore was not included in weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted when calculating diluted earnings per share.

for each of 2023 and 2022. At April 30, 2023 and 2022, there was of accrued compensation expense related to the deferred stock units expected to be issued in December of the following fiscal year. for 2023 primarily consists of the sale of all of the Company s minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately surface acres of land in Brighton, Colorado. Other income of for 2022 primarily consists of received in connection with the bankruptcy of a warranty provider, of debt forgiveness with respect to a note payable and earned from a life insurance policy for a retired executive of the Company. , yielding an income tax benefit of for U.S. federal corporate income taxes and an income tax benefit of for New Mexico state corporate income taxes. The Company expects its operations to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefit of this tax loss. The full tax benefit expected from the Company s worthless stock deduction was accrued during 2023 and reflected as a reduction to the Company s (benefit) provision for income taxes and an increase in deferred income taxes, net without any valuation allowance. The Company did not provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, net with respect to the worthless stock deduction due to the Company s belief that it is more likely than not based upon the available evidence that such deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projected its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of such deferred tax assets. While the Company believes that it has utilized a reasonable method to make this valuation allowance determination, should factors and conditions differ materially from those used by the Company in making such determination (including if the Company does not generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefit of the tax loss included in deferred income taxes, net), the actual realization of deferred tax assets could differ materially from the reported amounts. This tax loss may be subject to audit and possible adjustment by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS ), which could result in a reversal of none, part or all of the income tax benefit or could result in a benefit higher than the amount recorded. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, the Company may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which would adversely affect the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the tax benefit the Company will receive, if any. Under federal income tax law, net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period and the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited to 80 of taxable income in any year during the carryforward period. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change. A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5 of the Company s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year

Exhibit 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 The following summary of the capital stock of AMREP Corporation (the Company does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company s certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time, and the Company s by-laws, as amended from time to time, each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, and certain provisions of Oklahoma law. Authorized Capital Stock The Company is authorized to issue a total of 20,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting entirely of common stock, par value .10 per share. As of July 10, 2023, there were 5,254,909 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Common Stock General . Each share of the Company s common stock has the same rights and privileges. Holders of the Company s common stock do not have any preferences or any preemptive, conversion or exchange rights. All of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The Company s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AXR. Voting Rights . The holders of the Company s common stock are entitled to vote upon all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders and are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. The Company s certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not provide for cumulative voting. Dividends . The holders of the Company s common stock are entitled to participate ratably in dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be declared by the Company s board of directors out of any funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Liquidation and Distribution . If the Company voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves or wind-ups, or upon any distribution of the Company s assets, the holders of the Company s common stock will be entitled to receive all of the assets remaining after payment of liabilities and amounts owed to creditors, equally and ratably in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them. Certain Charter and By-law Provisions; Oklahoma Law Some sections of the Company s certificate of incorporation and by-laws and provisions of Oklahoma law may discourage certain transactions involving a change in control of the Company. Special Meetings . The Company s by-laws provide that special meetings of the Company s shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the president or a majority of the members of the board of directors. This provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to take actions opposed by the board of directors. Classified board of directors . The Company s certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that classify the Company s board of directors into three classes, with one class being elected each year. Because the Company s certificate of incorporation and by-laws do not otherwise provide, Section 1027 of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act permits the removal of any member of the Company s board of directors only for cause. These provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving the Company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the Company s common stock. No Cumulative Voting . The Oklahoma General Corporation Act provides that shareholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless the Company s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. The Company s certificate of incorporation does not expressly provide for cumulative voting. Under cumulative voting, minority shareholders holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors. 

 Amendment of By-laws . The Company s certificate of incorporation permits the Company s board of directors to adopt, amend and repeal the Company s by-laws. The Oklahoma General Corporation Act provides that shareholders are entitled to amend the Company s by-laws. Certain Business Combinations and Transactions with interested shareholders . The Company s certificate of incorporation prohibits the Company from: 1. engaging in a merger or consolidation with an interested shareholder or affiliate of an interested shareholder; 2. selling, leasing, exchanging, mortgaging, pledging or transferring assets valued in excess of 5 million to, or with, an interested shareholder or affiliate of an interested shareholder; 3. issuing to an interested shareholder or affiliate of an interested shareholder the Company s shares or shares of the Company s subsidiaries with a value in excess of 5 million; 4. adopting a plan or proposal for liquidation or dissolution advanced by an interested shareholder or affiliate of an interested shareholder; or 5. reclassifying, recapitalizing, entering into a merger or consolidation of the Company s subsidiaries, or entering into any other transaction that has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of outstanding shares held by an interested shareholder or affiliate of an interested shareholder, unless, in each case, such transaction is approved by the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. This provision, however, does not apply to any of the above transactions if: (a) the shareholders would not receive cash or any other consideration (including retaining their common stock in a transaction in which the Company survives) in their capacities as shareholders and, before the transaction, at least 75 of the board of directors has approved the transaction, or (b) the shareholders would receive cash or other consideration, and either (i) before the transaction, at least 75 of the board of directors approved the transaction, or (ii) all of the conditions set forth in the following subclauses (A) through (F) shall have been met: (A) the price per share of the Company s common stock meets certain minimums as specified in the Company s certificate of incorporation; (B) the consideration is cash or whatever form of consideration that the interested shareholder used to acquire the Company s common stock (or the largest block of the Company s common stock if acquired in a series of transactions); (C) since becoming an interested shareholder and until the consummation of the proposed transaction there have been (1) no reduction in dividends and (2) appropriate increases to dividends to reflect any reclassifications, recapitalizations, reorganizations or any similar transactions, unless in the case of (1) or (2) the alternative has been approved by at least 75 of the Company s board of directors; (D) since becoming an interested shareholder and until the consummation of the proposed transaction the interested shareholder has not become the beneficial owner of additional shares, except as the result of a dividend or stock split; (E) since becoming an interested shareholder and until the proposed transaction the interested shareholder has not received benefit, directly or indirectly, of any loans, advances, guarantees pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages from the Company; and (F) a proxy or information statement complying with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, describing the proposed transaction is mailed to the Company s other shareholders, regardless of whether such proxy or information statement is required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the Company s certificate of incorporation, an interested shareholder is defined, generally, as any person who or which (i) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the Company s outstanding common stock; (ii) is an affiliate of the Company, and at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date of determination of interested shareholder status, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of 

 the Company s then outstanding common stock; or (iii) is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to any shares of the Company s common stock which were at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date of determination of interested shareholder status beneficially owned by an interested shareholder, if such assignment or succession occurred in the course of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act. Under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, mergers, consolidations, and sales of substantially all of the assets of an Oklahoma corporation must generally be approved by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon. The Company is subject to Section 1090.3 of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, however, which restricts certain transactions between an Oklahoma corporation (or its majority owned subsidiaries) and a holder of 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, together with affiliates or associates thereof (excluding persons who were 15 shareholders on September 1, 1991, or who become such by action of the corporation alone), which is referred to as an interested shareholder. For a period of three years following the date that a shareholder became an interested shareholder, Section 1090.3 prohibits the following types of transactions between the corporation and the interested shareholder (unless certain conditions, described below, are met): (i) mergers or consolidations; (ii) sales, leases, exchanges or other transfers of 10 or more of the aggregate assets of the corporation; (iii) issuances or transfers by the corporation of any stock of the corporation that would have the effect of increasing the interested shareholder s proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation; (iv) receipt by the interested shareholder of the benefit, except proportionately as a shareholder of the corporation, of loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by the corporation; and (v) any other transaction which has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation that is owned by the interested shareholder. This restriction does not apply if: (1) before such person became an interested shareholder, the board of directors approved the transaction in which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder or approved the business combination; or (2) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, those shares owned by (i) persons who are directors and also officers, and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (3) the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested shareholder. The Company may exempt the Company from the requirements of the statute by adopting an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for the Company s common stock is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. New York Exchange Listing The Company s common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AXR.
