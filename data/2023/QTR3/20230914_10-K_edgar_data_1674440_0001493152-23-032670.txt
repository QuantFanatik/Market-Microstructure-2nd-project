 to the business operations, which could result in the loss of our right to continue to operate or develop the specific businesses
 described in the agreements; 

risk
 that we will be unable to secure additional financing in the near future in order to commence and sustain our planned development
 and growth plans;

risks
 related to the inherent uncertainty of business operations including profit, cost of goods, production costs and cost estimates and
 the potential for unexpected costs and expenses; 

risks
 related to commodity price fluctuations; 

the
 uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses; 

risks

ITEM
1. Business 

History
of our Company 

Lazex
Inc. Lazex was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015. On August 23, 2019, the majority
owner of Lazex entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Slinger Bag Americas Inc., a Delaware corporation Slinger Bag Americas ),
which was 100 owned by Slinger Bag Ltd. SBL ), an Israeli company. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, Slinger
Bag Americas acquired 2,000,000 shares of common stock of Lazex for 332,239. On September 16, 2019, SBL transferred its ownership of
Slinger Bag Americas to Lazex in exchange for the 200,000 shares of Lazex acquired on August 23, 2019. As a result of these transactions,
Lazex owned 100 of Slinger Bag Americas and the sole shareholder of SBL owned 200,000 shares of common stock (approximately 82 of
Lazex. Effective September 13, 2019, Lazex changed its name to Slinger Bag Inc. 

On
October 31, 2019, Slinger Bag Americas acquired control of Slinger Bag Canada, Inc., Slinger Bag Canada a Canadian company
incorporated on November 3, 2017. There were no assets, liabilities or historical operational activity of Slinger Bag Canada. 

On
February 10, 2020, Slinger Bag Americas became the 100 owner of SBL, along with SBL s wholly owned subsidiary Slinger Bag International
(UK) Limited Slinger Bag UK ), which was formed on April 3, 2019. On February 10, 2021, Zehava Tepler, the owner of SBL,
contributed Slinger Bag UK to Slinger Bag Americas for no consideration. 

Effective
February 25, 2020, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 via a four-to-one
forward split of its outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share information contained in this report have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split. 

On
June 21, 2021, Slinger Bag Americas entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with Charles Ruddy to acquire a 100 ownership
stake in Foundation Sports Systems, LLC Foundation Sports ). 

On
February 2, 2022, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Flixsense Pty, Ltd. Gameface ). As a result
of the share purchase agreement, Gameface would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

On
February 22, 2022, the Company entered into a merger agreement with PlaySight Interactive Ltd. PlaySight and Rohit Krishnan
(the Shareholders Representative ). As a result of the merger agreement, PlaySight would become a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. 

During
April 2022, the Company determined that the technology utilized in the Foundation Sports acquired entity would take substantially more
financial resources and more time to bring to market and achieve profitability than originally anticipated. As a result, the goodwill
and intangible assets related to Foundation Sports were fully impaired as of April 30, 2022, resulting in an impairment loss of 3,486,599.
In addition, during April 2022 the Company decided to sell a portion of Foundation Sports. The Company continued to classify Foundation
Sports in continuing operations, until December 5, 2022 when it sold 75 of Foundation Sports back to the original owners at which time
it deconsolidated this subsidiary and recorded a loss on the sale. The Company also determined to dispose of the PlaySight entity during
the year ended April 30, 2023. The Company completed the sale in November 2022 and recorded a loss on the sale at that time. 

1 

In
April 2022, the Company changed its domicile from Nevada to Delaware. On April 7, 2022, the Company effected a name change to Connexa
Sports Technologies Inc. We also changed our ticker symbol, CNXA . Connexa is now the holding company under which Slinger
Bag, PlaySight, Gameface and Foundation Sports reside. 

The
operations of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger Bag UK, SBL, Foundation Sports, PlaySight and Gameface
are collectively referred to as the Company. 

On
June 14, 2022, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, where the Company s common stock began to trade on a reverse
split adjusted basis. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split and all such fractional interests were
rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of common stock. All references to the outstanding stock have been retrospectively adjusted
to reflect this reverse split. The Company also consummated a public offering of shares of its common stock and the listing of its common
stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On November 17, 2022, Gabriel
Goldman and Rohit Krishnan resigned from the board of directors of the Company. Gabriel and Rohit were members of the audit and compensation
committees. Gabriel Goldman was a member of the Company s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Neither Gabriel nor Rohit
advised the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. 

On
November 27, 2022, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the Agreement with PlaySight, Chen Shachar and
Evgeni Khazanov (together, the Buyer pursuant to which the Buyer purchased 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of
PlaySight from the Company in exchange for (1) releasing the Company from all of PlaySight s obligations towards its vendors, employees,
tax authorities and any other (past, current and future) creditors of PlaySight; (2) waiver by the Buyer of 100 of the personal consideration
owed to them under their employment agreements in the total amount of U.S. 600,000 (which would have been increased in December 2022
to U.S. 800,000); and (3) cash consideration of U.S. 2 million to be paid to the Company as follows: 

(i) 
 a
 promissory note in the amount of U.S. 2 million issued and delivered to the Company (the Promissory Note ). 

(ii) 
 The
 maturity due date of the Promissory Note is December 31, 2023 subject to a one year extension in the discretion of the Buyer until
 December 31, 2024. 

(iii) 
 The
 Promissory Note can be partially paid over the time, but in the event it is not paid in full by December 31, 2024, then the remaining
 amount due (i.e. U.S. 2 million less any amount paid), will be converted into ordinary shares of PlaySight (the Deposited
 Shares ), which will be deposited with the escrow company of Altshuler Shaham Trust Ltd. (the Escrow Agent for
 the benefit of the Company or, at the election of the Company, issued in the form of a stock certificate or recorded in some other
 market-standard format to be held by the Escrow Agent. 

(iv) 
 The
 number of the Deposited Shares shall be determined according to the post-money valuation of the last investment round of the Company,
 and in the absence of such investment round, the total number of the Deposited Shares shall be 2 million divided by the Company s
 valuation to be determined at that time by a third party appraiser, to be nominated by both the Company and the Buyer (the Appraiser ).
 The Company and the Buyer have agreed that the identity of the Appraiser shall be Murray Devine Valuation Advisers, to the extent
 their cost of the appraisal shall not be higher than the cost of other appraisers from the big 4 accounting firms (i.e. E Y,
 KPMG, PWC and Deloitte). The Company and the Buyer have agreed to split the cost of the Appraiser. 

The
Company has also released PlaySight from all of its obligations (except for those created by the Agreement) in respect of the Company,
including any inter-company debts on the books, and the Buyer has released the Company from all of its obligations (except for those
created by the Agreement) in respect of PlaySight and the Buyer. 

The
reason for the entry into the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby was to eliminate the need for the Company to provide
further financing for PlaySight s operations. 

On
December 5, 2022, the Company assigned 75 of its membership interest in Foundation Sports to Charles Ruddy, its founder and granted
him the right for a period of three years to purchase the remaining 25 of its Foundation Sports membership interests for 500,000 in
cash. As of December 5, 2022, the results of Foundation Sports will no longer be consolidated in the Company s financial statements,
and the investment was accounted for as an equity method investment. On December 5, 2022, the Company analyzed this investment and established
a reserve for the investment at the full amount of 500,000. The Company intends to enter into a database access and marketing agreement
with Foundation Sports pursuant to which Foundation Sports will (i) provide the Company with sporting or racquet facility information
and contact data of its customers (subject to applicable law) and (ii) publish any promotional content, call to action, survey or similar
promotional communications provided by the Company to Foundation Sport s customers for its Customers to promote said material to
their extended network of consumers in exchange for 7 of any gross revenue to be generated from such activities. 

On
March 7, 2023, Slinger Bag entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for Padel Tennis with a company located in Valencia, Spain
called with Desarrollo y Promocion de Padel S.L. This agreement is contracted to deliver approximately 20million in revenue over a 5-year
period. 

Delinquency
Notices 

On
October 10, 2022, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating that the Company s
common stock is subject to potential delisting from Nasdaq because, for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of the
Company s common stock has closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule
5450(a)(1) (the Bid Price Rule ). The Nasdaq notice indicated that, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),
the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until April 10, 2023, to regain compliance. If the Company were to fail to regain
compliance with the Bid Price Rule before April 10, 2023, t he Company may be eligible for an additional
180-calendar day compliance period. The Company failed to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by April 10, 2023 and requested and
received an additional period of 180 days until October 9, 2023 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The
Company is in the process of obtaining shareholder consent to effect a reverse split of its shares of common stock. If granted, the Company
will initiate a reverse split as soon as reasonably practical thereafter in an attempt to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement. 

2 

On
July 26, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that the Company s
stockholders equity as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended January 31, 2023 did not satisfy
the continued listing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires that a listed company s stockholders 
equity be at least 2.5 million (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement ). The Company timely submitted a compliance
plan to the Panel and on August 23, 2023 received notice from Nasdaq that it has until January 22, 2024 to demonstrate compliance with
the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy the Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, regain compliance with
the Rule, the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement, and the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and maintain compliance with other
Nasdaq listing requirements. 

Operations 

The
Company operates in the sports equipment and technology business. The Company is the owner of the Slinger Launcher, which is comprised
of a portable tennis ball launcher, a portable padel tennis ball launcher and a portable pickleball launcher and Gameface AI, providing
AI technology and performance analytics. 

From
inception to date, we have been focused on the ball sport market globally. Our first product, the Slinger Bag Launcher, is a patented,
highly portable, versatile and affordable ball launcher built into an easy to transport wheeled trolley bag. 

Tennis
ball machines have been around since the 1950 s when they were introduced by Rene Lacoste. Improvements to performance were made
in the 1970 s when Prince started its tennis business on the back of its first product Little Prince which was
a vacuum operated ball machine. In the 1990 s the first battery operated machines came to the market and since that time very little,
if anything, has changed in the structure of ball machines products outside of added computerization. Typically, the machines being marketed
by traditional ball machine brands are large, cumbersome and awkward to operate. They are also generally expensive often well
above U.S. 1,000 compared to the entry price of 700 for a Slinger Bag Launcher. We believe that up until the introduction of the Slinger
Bag Launcher, the majority of traditional tennis ball machines were sold to tennis facilities, institutions and tennis teachers, with
only a few being sold directly to tennis playing consumers. 

Recent Events 

On September 13, the Company held
a special meeting of stockholders in which the following items were approved: (i) the issuance of (i) 1,018,510 shares of the our common
stock, par value 0.001 per share, that were issued on October 3, 2022, and, (ii) 11,802,002 shares of our common stock issuable upon
exercise of Pre-Funded Warrants at an exercise price of 0.00001 per share, (iii) 12,820,512 shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of 5-Year Warrants at an exercise price of 0.39 per share, (iv) 25,641,024 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of 7.5 Year Warrants at an exercise price of 0.43 per share and (v) 18,099,548 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise
of 5.5 Year Warrants at an at an exercise price per share equal to 0.221 per share to Armistice Capital Master Fund Ltd and (ii) a reverse
stock split of our common stock within a range of one (1)-for-ten (10) to one (1)-for-forty (40) Reverse Stock Split ),
with the Board of Directors of the Company to set the specific ratio and determine the date for the reverse split to be effective and
any other action deemed necessary to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split, without further approval or authorization of stockholders, at
any time within 12 months of the special meeting date. 

Industry
Overview 

Over
the next five years, we believe that there will be a significant increase in demand from sports consumers for AI (artificial
intelligence) technology that will play an integral role in supporting their enjoyment of their chosen sport through personalized
insights and analytics and associated self-coaching tools. 

3 

Over
the course of the next twelve months, we will be focused on reaching the global tennis, padel tennis and pickleball communities as our
primary target markets. The ITF cites the global tennis market as having 80 million active participants, with many million other consumers
being acknowledged as avid fans of the sport. Pickleball is now widely recognized as the fastest growing sport in the United States with
over 5 million regular players and Padel Tennis is also seeing significant participant growth throughout Europe and South America primarily.
Currently it is estimated that there are up to as many as 10 million Padel players globally. In addition, we will also be looking to introduce to
the Tennis market an upgraded Tennis Launcher and towards the latter end of the year we aim to be in a final test phase of our Baseball
/ Softball Launcher consumer testing, as we see this market as a significant future growth opportunity. 

Manufacturing
and Distribution 

Production
of the Slinger Bag Launcher is based in southern China. We are engaged with 10 individual part suppliers, and all of these parts come
together at our contracted assembly facility in Xiamen, China, where the Launchers are assembled and quality control checked before being
processed for global distribution. 

Our
manufacturing capacity is estimated at approximately 5,000 units monthly. This capacity will be shared across our three Slinger Bag Launcher
products tennis, pickleball, and padel. The pickleball product was introduced to the market in March 2023 and was followed by
Padel Tennis in June 2023. 

In
developing our Slinger Bag tennis, pickleball and padel launchers, we have designed the three products that share many common parts.
We expect this to aid efficiency of the production process. 

We
have engaged an independent and experienced vendor management company to manage all of our production activities, our quality control
process and quality assurance activities, both across our individual vendor partners and at the assembly facility. These processes have
been developed together with the Company with a goal of producing consistently high-quality and high performing products. 

We
have created a global distribution network, and all shipments of our products made to distributor markets outside of the United States
and Canada are shipped free-on-board FOB from Xiamen, China, at which point they enter into the ownership of the distributors
and become their responsibility. South American distributors are sometimes serviced from our US warehouse locations and European distributors
continue to be able to place replacement orders through a small third-party distribution facility located in Rotterdam, Netherlands. 

Additionally,
we ship our Slinger-Dunlop co-branded tennis balls produced by Dunlop (the largest global supplier of tennis balls) to the United
States to be sold via our e-commerce platform or directly from source to our distributor network for further distribution around the
world. 

Gameface
is a software-as-a-service company and, as such, has no direct procurement or supply chain requirements. 

Strategy 

Slinger
Bag Launchers for tennis, pickleball and padel 

In
introducing the Slinger Bag Launcher, we saw an opportunity to disrupt the traditional tennis market. Through until March 2023 Slinger
Bag has been a single product company marketing its Tennis Launcher for tennis players of all ages and abilities. Currently, approximately
70 of Slinger Bag Tennis Launcher revenues are generated through our direct-to-consumer strategy in North America. We operate a third-party
distributor structure in all markets outside of North America. Distributor partners have exclusive territories and / or product categories.
We endeavor to partner with distributors who have a recognized background within the tennis, pickleball or padel industries for their
respective market, along with them having the requisite financial capacity and service infrastructure to grow the Slinger Bag brand through
a similar go-to-market strategy as is operated directly by the Slinger Bag business in North America. All distributors purchase
Slinger Bag Launchers at a discounted distributor pricing structure, which is considerably lower than the US consumer price, and are responsible
for placing their product orders up to 3 months in advance of their delivery requirement. As part of this distributor program, in April
2023 we appointed a global distribution partner for Padel Tennis - Desarrollo y Promocion de Padel S.L., a division of Manza Sport based
in Valencia, Spain a company that has over 20 years of experience in the global Padel market as a leading supplier of Padel courts. 

The
United States market will remain predominantly a direct-to-consumer market for Slinger Bag for all sport verticals. 

4 

As
the largest tennis and pickleball market in the world with 17.4 million tennis players and over 5 million pickleball players, the
United States is a key market both to establish the Slinger brand and to drive demonstrable growth. Direct-to-consumer e-commerce
sales are further supplemented by one or more third-party internet sites focused on either the tennis or the pickleball market. The
Unites States market is served by third-party logistics facilities in West Columbia, South Carolina and Reno, Nevada, which are
operated by two of our logistics partners. All end consumer service support is currently managed by a small service team based in
Canada. All distributor partners are managed and supported by our distributor manager located in Israel. 

Gameface 

Gameface
will provide the consumer with access to analytics data through a sport specific automated AI platform that analyzes and extracts
data from uploaded consumer or team videos. Gameface has successfully launched this technology previously in Cricket in Australia
and is working to introduce to the market a unique application for Tennis. Once tested and established in Tennis, this technology
can easily be adapted for other racquetsports, baseball, cricket and other sports verticals. Gameface s core capabilities are
delivered through a compatible single camera or smart phone, which allows us to build scalable solutions for the sports market
without relying on specific hardware or camera types. 

We
envision Gameface as a product and technology that will be at the heart of powering the Connexa portfolio of brands.
We also see Gameface technology as a driver of real-time data and analytics for Connexa s core sport focus across all
racquetsports, baseball and cricket coupled with partnerships with external brands and other strategic partners for its
applications for all other sports, outside of these core categories. 

Gameface
initially focused its technology on the cricket and soccer markets, where it has built an automated platform to extract various data
points from live and archived match footage. The Gameface team has been dedicated to building its technology to deliver performance insights
in tennis, which will form the core of our new Slinger app, which is planned to be launched in late 2023. After launching the tennis
app, Gameface plans to revisit the cricket vertical and enhance its technology offering based on the advances made in its tennis AI,
which will broaden and deepen its reach across the cricket world. In 2024 and going forward, Gameface expects to dedicate resources to
baseball analytics and identifying strategic partners for other high-profile team sports such as basketball and soccer. We also intend
to license technology to validated global partners in sports verticals that remain non-core to Connexa with the aim to become the recognized
leader in sports AI globally. 

Connexa
Brand Marketing 

With
the go-to-market strategy for Slinger Bag focused on its core North American tennis and pickleball markets as a direct-to-consumer
business e-commerce brand, all in-house marketing activity and advertising media is centered around a consumer push to the Slinger
Bag e-commerce platform at https://www.slingerbag.com/ and then working to convert brand or product interest to purchases. Based on
the target tennis and pickleball demographic, our marketing focus centers around three core marketing pillars:
digital advertising; influencers and brand ambassadors. Our marketing efforts also focus on core targeted social media platforms
such as Facebook, Google, Instagram and You Tube. 

Using
demographic data for tennis and pickleball and following a period of advertising testing, our digital advertising spend is focused mainly
towards Facebook and Google platforms. 

5 

In
addition to our paid marketing activities, Slinger Bag relies on the expertise of our small internal team to build out a network of
 followers across various social media platforms mainly Instagram, Facebook, You Tube and LinkedIn. Slinger Bag
has significant numbers of its consumers who are avid fans of our brand and fully engaged in generating Slinger Bag related social
media content through their own means. 

Since
inception, Slinger Bag has built up a base of in excess of 60,000 users of Slinger Bag. Through our acquisition and retained
interest in Foundation Sports we have access to Foundation s database of over 500,000 avid tennis players. We use email
marketing to engage with this groups a few times per annum in order to generate additional sales interest. Ultimately, this group
will also form the core target consumer market for our upcoming launch of the Slinger Tennis App. 

The
Slinger Bag brand ambassador team has also been integral to the overall brand marketing strategy through their support of our product
and by creating and sharing their user content, representing themselves as affiliated with the brand and through their personal appearances
at events, tournaments, etc. During the fiscal year that ended on April 30, 2022, our ambassador team included: Tommy Hass, Robert Bryan,
Darren Cahill, Eugenie Bouchard, Patrick Mouratoglou, Dustin Brown and the Jensen brothers. All ambassador arrangements terminated
prior to the date hereof, which means that we no longer have any active tennis ambassadors. 

Similar
prominent ambassadors are being identified for both pickleball in the United States of America and by our exclusive padel
distributor for the global padel market and are expected to be in place and active over the coming months. 

Outside
of our core marketing strategy, Slinger Bag has taken advantage of numerous opportunities to partner with key brands in the tennis and
pickleball spaces and/or to advertise at key tennis or pickleball related events. 

Additionally,
through our management team s close association to the tennis industry, we have been able to provide many touring professionals
with a Slinger Bag Launcher for their personal use. These arrangements were non-contractual product seeding opportunities. Players have
occasionally posted on social media about their use of the Slinger Bag Launcher, which, based on their significant social media followings,
have supported the growth of the Slinger Bag brand awareness. 

To
support the Slinger Bag marketing program, we have engaged the following agencies: 

Ad
 Venture Media Group, a New York based PPC (pay-per-click) agency whose work is grounded in scientific analysis of consumer data and
 consumer trends. Ad Venture Media leads all of our paid digital and social media advertising activities for Slinger Bag on a performance-based
 fee structure. 

We
 have partnered with Team Activations through their Team HQS portal to manage an affiliate marketing program geared towards US-based
 teaching professionals, players, juniors and events, in the United States tennis and pickleball markets. This target market is provided
 with unique affiliate marketing links and encouraged to create content and to share it on their social media accounts and in other
 such communities that they are connected to, in order to receive an affiliate marketing fee based on revenues generated by consumers
 purchasing Slinger Bag products attributable to them, via their direct link. 

Each
distributor is also conducting its own Slinger brand marketing program. All efforts in this regard are aimed at reaching the avid
tennis player directly and are focused on ensuring that the Slinger Bag brand message is consistent around the globe. Slinger Bag
supports all of its brand distributors with full access to all of the company s marketing partners, brand assets, as well as
with direct contact to our internal marketing team. 

Our
marketing budget is primarily funded by, or determined in accordance with, the distributor partner and is linked to the distributors
annual purchase objectives. Each distributor executes local grassroots programs, including demonstration days, local teaching pro
partnerships, specialist tennis network communications, providing Slinger Bag product locally as necessary to the local market key
influencers across tennis, pickleball and padel to further increase the intensity of the influencer effort and broaden consumer
awareness. Typically, we support these activities with either discounted products or certain quantities of free products.
Distributor marketing budgets are allocated to Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other relevant websites or platforms in
their region, and several are supported, approved and /or overseen by AdVenture Media Group where applicable.

Brand
Endorsements 

In
2021 we reached agreements with several globally recognized tennis players and coaches to become brand ambassadors, but those agreements
terminated in the first two calendar quarters of 2023. 

We
are now in the process of re-evaluating this program and of potentially either renewing a select core group or identifying new ambassadors
for our tennis activities and for relevant ambassadors to support our Pickleball and Padel category activities. 

We
have also engaged with the following organizations to promote our Slinger brand and products. 

Peter
Burwash International PBI ), a United States-based, highly respected, global tennis services company set up by Peter Burwash
some 35 years ago. PBI provides tennis programs and other tennis services to over 28 of the global luxury resorts. Slinger Bag Launchers
are available to use at each resort and the PBI team will be actively promoting the Slinger brand as part of our affiliate marketing
activity. 

The
Dink a leading Pickleball platform with 250,000 active pickleball players on their database. 

Strategic
Brand Partnerships 

Slinger
Bag believes that building strong strategic partnerships across the sport of tennis underpins the credibility and awareness of the Slinger
Bag brand. As such, we currently have several strategic partnerships across tennis. We believe these partnerships provide us significant
levels of brand exposure and credibility driving mutually beneficial marketing campaigns aimed at reaching avid tennis players globally. 

Details
of such partners announced and active include: 

Dunlop:
 We have entered a strategic partnership with one of the most iconic tennis brands in the world, Dunlop, for the supply of co-branded
 Slinger-Dunlop tennis balls across the globe. 

Peter
 Burwash International: An organization providing coaching and tennis services to high-level, high-quality hotels, resorts and tennis
 facilities across the globe. 

Tennis
 Europe: In partnership with our European distributor, Dunlop, Slinger Bag is the official tennis ball launcher of the Tennis Europe
 organization. Tennis Europe provides a platform for 60,000 aspiring junior tennis players to compete in age-group categorized
 events. 

Country
 Federations: Slinger Bag is an official partner of the UK Lawn Tennis Association LTA ). 

In
similar vein, we are looking to deliver partnerships for the co-branded supply of Pickle Balls and Padel Tennis Balls.

Seasonal
Business 

We
expect to experience minor fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. We expect revenues in the first and fourth fiscal
quarters to typically exceed those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales across our group may vary
considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for tennis and other sports equipment and in
connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as any Grand Slam tennis tournament and, over time, other sports competitions
and in relation to new product market launches. 

Costs
and Effects of Complying with Environmental Regulations 

Set

Research
and Development 

Slinger
Bag 

Slinger
Bag is working with our vendor management partner, Stride Innovation, and our China based vendors to produce ball launchers for new
market segments, such as Pickleball, Padel and Baseball/Softball. These efforts are collaborative and based on a detailed product
brief and in-depth market and consumer research for each product category. The development timetable of the Slinger Bag Launcher for
the new market segments from concept to market launch is approximately 18 months and includes at least 2 rounds or in-market field
testing. 

We
are currently field testing our new our Baseball / Softball launchers, which are expected to be introduced to the market in 2024. We
plan to introduce similar transportable, versatile and affordable ball launchers for cricket and other ball sports over the course of
the next three years. 

In
regard to development of our pending performance and analytics app, the development team of Gameface is working to create a Tennis specific
analysis code for the app. We have also contracted with a design agency to build the road map for the user experience based on the technology
being developed. 

10 

Gameface 

Gameface
is involved in additional research and development of building methods to extract data reliably and more accurately from videos. A large
part of our research also includes identifying and associating extracted data points of athlete performance. Gameface is currently field
testing its new data visualization techniques to represent data in tennis and cricket, which are expected to be introduced late in 2023. 

Quality
Control 

Quality
control is a critical function within our company. 

As
a relatively new brand in the market, our business enterprise success will in part dependent on the quality and consistency of our products.
Slinger Bag has engaged Stride-Innovation, a company with in-depth experience working with ball sport companies such as ours, has
the knowledge, resources and 20 years of experience in working with Chinese vendors of sports equipment. 

In
partnership, together, we have created and documented quality guidelines, testing procedures and warranty processes. We have implemented
an agreed quality audit process for all product parts being received and used by our product assembly vendor. All products go through
a rigorous, statistically validated quality control testing approval process before being confirmed as available to be released for shipment
to one of our distribution centers or to any of our distribution partners. 

We
offer a limited warranty with all purchases in accordance with local market statutory regulations. 

Vendors 

Slinger
Bag works only with and through third-party suppliers. Slinger Bag has a formal supply of service agreement in place with our vendor
management partner, Stride-Innovation, for a wide range of support and services. We have a written agreement in place with our main assembly
vendor partner, Xiamen Ruicheng Industrial Design Co., Ltd. 

Stride-Innovation
quality control teams regularly visit each of our vendor facilities and monitor production, employee conditions and welfare, and undertake
quality control testing. We do not utilize or condone the use of child labor of any kind in the production of our products. 

Employees 

As
at the date of this report, we have 9 full-time employees spread across Israel, USA, Australia and the UK. Management believes its relations
with employees is good. We also hire part-time employees and engage consultants to support our operations as needed. 

Facilities 

Our
principal office is located at 2709 N. Rolling Road, Suite 138, Windsor Mill, Maryland 21244. We entered into a lease for use of office
space at this location effective September 1, 2019. This location is owned by Zeek Logistics, which is a company owned by Yonah Kalfa,
who is a director, Chief Innovation Officer, and our largest shareholder. We do not pay any rent or fee to use this location. 

11 

COVID-19
Supply Issues 

Slinger
Bag is a business fully reliant on China based vendors for manufacture of its product. Throughout the course of 2022 the flow of production
was occasionally affected as the China government implemented regional lockdowns. As a company in the late part of 2021 we had anticipated
potential issues and made a conscious decision to over produce product to store at our warehouse locations to mitigate any enforced production
shutdowns. Over the course of 2022 and through the date of this report we have not experienced any significant supply chain issues in
the availability of our product. 

Gameface
is primarily a software based company. As a result of the nature of its business, in the time that that we owned Gameface we
have not seen any material impact on its business because of any Covid related issues. 

Ukraine
War 

The
impact of the Ukraine ware has been limited on the Company with the direct impact being seen through those distributors bordering the
war zone who have seen a significant decline in demand. 

Gameface
 no direct impact seen on this business to date. 

Going
Concern 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge its
liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We have an accumulated deficit and more losses are anticipated
in the ongoing development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due.
Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from related parties, and/or
private placement of debt and/or common stock. 

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds
will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital
resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force us to curtail
substantially or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant
dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. 

In
the Company s fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, the Company divested PlaySight and 75 of its interest in Foundation Sports
as the required monthly cash burn became increasingly difficult to manage as inflation rose and the cost of manufacturing the Company s
non-technological products grew. As a result, the Company sold PlaySight back to its original owners of in November 2022, and the Company
sold most (75 of Foundation Tennis back to their original owners, with an option to purchase any remaining interests. The Company believes
these divestitures will bring about greater cash flow and result in a reduction in net loss from operations. 

12 

We
intend to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of the commencement of revenues,
with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional equity and debt financing. We anticipate raising additional funds
through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations;
however, we may not have commitments from third parties for a sufficient amount of additional capital. We cannot be certain that any
such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and its failure to raise capital when needed could limit its ability
to continue its operations. Our ability to obtain additional funding will determine its ability to continue as a going concern. Failure
to secure additional financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance,
results of operations and stock price and require it to curtail or cease operations, sell off its assets, seek protection from its creditors
through bankruptcy proceedings, or otherwise. Furthermore, additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of shares of our
common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, and strategic relationships, if necessary, to raise
additional funds, and may require that we relinquish valuable rights. 

ITEM
1A. Risk Factors 

You
should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial
statements and related notes that appear at the end of this report, before deciding to invest in our securities. These risks should be
considered in conjunction with any other information included herein, including in conjunction with forward-looking statements made herein.
If any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating
results. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business,
financial condition and operating results. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we
believe are the material factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results
to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. 

Risks
Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry 

We
depend on the strength of our brands. 

We
expect to derive substantially all of our net sales from sales of branded products and services we own, including Slinger and Gameface.
The reputation and integrity of our brands are essential to the success of our business. We believe that our consumers value the status
and reputation of brands we promote, and the superior quality, performance, functionality and durability that our brands represent. Building,
maintaining and enhancing the status and reputation of our brands image is important to expanding our consumer base. Our continued
success and growth depend on our ability to protect and promote our brands, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, performance,
functionality and durability of our products and services, our communication activities, including advertising and public relations,
and our management of the consumer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service and warranty repairs. We may decide
to make substantial investments in these areas in order to maintain and enhance our brand, and such investments may not be successful. 

Additionally,
in order to expand our reach, we engage with third-party distributors. To the extent those third-party distributors fail to comply with
our operating guidelines, we may not be successful in protecting our brand image. Product defects, product recalls, counterfeit products
and ineffective marketing are among the potential threats to the strength of our brands and to protect our brands status we may
need to make substantial expenditures to mitigate the impact of such threats. 

Moreover,
if we fail to continue to innovate to ensure that our products are deemed to achieve superior levels of function, quality and design,
or to otherwise be sufficiently distinguishable from our competitors products, or if we fail to manage the growth of our on-line
sales in a way that protects the high-end nature of our brands, the value of our brands may be diluted, and we may not be able to maintain
our premium position and pricing or sales volumes, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business. We believe that
maintaining and enhancing our brands image in new markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to expanding our consumer
base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brands in new markets, then our growth strategy could be adversely affected. 

13 

The
cost of raw materials, labor or freight could lead to an increase in our cost of sales and cause our results of operations to suffer . 

Increasing
costs for raw materials, labor or freight could make our sourcing processes more costly and negatively affect our gross margin and profitability.
Labor costs at our independent manufacturers sites have been increasing and it is unlikely that these increases will abate. Wage
and price inflation in our source countries could cause unanticipated price increases, which may be significant. Such price increases
by our independent manufacturers could be rapid in the absence of manufacturing contracts. Energy costs have fluctuated dramatically
in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Rising energy costs may increase our costs of transporting our products for distribution
and the costs of products that we source from independent suppliers. Further, many of our products are made of materials, such as high
impact plastics, plastic-injected molded parts, and lightweight high tensile strength metals, that are either petroleum-based or require
energy to construct and transport. Costs for transportation of such materials have been increasing as the price of petroleum increases.
Our independent suppliers and manufacturers may attempt to pass these cost increases on to us, and our relationships with them may be
harmed or lost if we refuse to pay such increases, which could lead to product shortages. If we pay such increases, we may not be able
to offset them through increases in our pricing and other means, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our targeted gross
margins. If we attempt to pass the increases on to consumers, our sales may be adversely affected. 

Our
international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business. 

All
of our equipment is manufactured outside of the U.S. with a large volume of our products being also sold outside of the U.S. Accordingly,
we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations,
varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes
in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the
uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom
and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the U.S. and
elsewhere as further described in other risks in this section. The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms
that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through
tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely
affect our results of operations. 

We
develop products in Israel and our chief marketing officer is located in Israel and, therefore, our business, financial condition and
results of operation may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel. 

A
portion of our operations, including product development, is based in Israel. Our research and development is conducted through our Israeli
subsidiary and our chief marketing officer and chief innovation officer are both located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic
and military conditions in Israel directly affect our business. 

Political,
economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948,
a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries, and between Israel and the Hamas and Hezbollah
extremist groups. In addition, several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel, and additional
countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies whether as a result of hostilities in the region
or otherwise. Any hostilities involving Israel, terrorist activities, political instability or violence in the region or the interruption
or curtailment of trade or transport between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations
and adversely affect the market price of our shares. 

Our
commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of an event associated with the security situation in the Middle
East. Although the Israeli government is currently committed to covering the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by
terrorist attacks or acts of war, there can be no assurance that this government coverage will be maintained, or if maintained, will
be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages incurred. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

14 

Further,
our operations could be disrupted by the obligations of our employees to perform military service. Our chief marketing officer is subject
to the obligation to perform reserve military duty. In response to increased tension and hostilities in the region, there have been,
at times, call-ups of military reservists, and it is possible that there will be additional call-ups in the future. Our operations could
be disrupted by the absence of these employees due to military service. Such disruption could harm our business and operating results. 

Popular
uprisings in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa are affecting the political stability of those countries. Such instability
may lead to deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the State of Israel and these countries. Furthermore,
several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel and companies with an Israeli presence, and additional
countries may impose restrictions on doing business with Israel and Israeli companies if hostilities in the region continue or intensify.
Such restrictions may seriously limit our ability to sell our products to customers in those countries. 

Our
manufacturing takes place in China and is susceptible to shutdowns and delays caused by the Coronavirus and other diseases and epidemics.
Additionally, we rely on independent manufacturers and suppliers. 

As
at the date hereof, one of our manufacturing facilities is located in southern China. Following the outbreak of the Coronavirus our manufacturing
facility was shut down for three months, which caused some unforeseen delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products. However,
there may be further outbreaks of the Coronavirus and other diseases and epidemics, which may cause further delays and shutdowns. This,
in turn, will negatively affect our revenue and increase our expenses and costs. 

We
do not control our independent manufacturers and suppliers or their labor and other business practices. Violations of labor, environmental
or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer s or supplier s labor
or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could disrupt the shipments of our products or
draw negative publicity for us, thereby diminishing the value of our brand, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting
our net income. Additionally, since we do not manufacture our products, we are subject to risks associated with inventory and product
quality-control. 

Further,
we have not historically entered into manufacturing contracts with our manufacturers; instead, we have hired them on an ad hoc basis.
Identifying a suitable manufacturer is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the prospective manufacturer s
quality control, responsiveness and service capabilities, financial stability and labor practices. While we have business continuity
and contingency plans for alternative sourcing, we may be unable, in the event of a significant disruption in our sourcing, to locate
alternative manufacturers or suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, which could result in product shortages
or decreases in product quality, and adversely affect our net sales, gross margin, net income, customer relationships and our reputation. 

We
rely heavily on supply chain reliability and predictability and continued disruption in our supply chain could have a material adverse
impact on operations. 

We
rely heavily on supply chain reliability and predictability in producing, transporting and delivering our products. The COVID-19 pandemic,
Ukraine war, inflationary trends, shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, availability of transport, labor shortages in the shipping,
trucking, and warehousing industries, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, equipment shortages and other factors have all contributed
to delivery delays, greater costs and uncertainty in arranging and scheduling transport of our products. If we are unable to reliably
and consistently arrange shipment and storage of our products, we may be unable to ship, deliver and store our products in which case,
we will have to reverse sales and issue refunds to purchasers of our products. Changes in U.S. and international trade policies, including
to import tariffs and trade policies and agreements, to address supply chain issues or otherwise could also have a significant impact
on our activities both in the United States and internationally. Supply chain disruptions, both domestic and international, have adversely
impacted our operations. Continued disruptions in our supply chain and adverse consequences from aggressive trade policies could have
a material adverse impact on our profitability and financial performance. 

15 

We
face risks associated with operating in international markets. 

We
operate in a global marketplace and international sales growth is a key element of our growth strategy. We are subject to risks associated
with our international operations, including, but not limited to: 

Foreign
 currency exchange rates; 

Economic
 or governmental instability in foreign markets in which we operate or in those countries from which we source our merchandise; 

Unexpected
 changes in laws, regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws; 

Increases
 in the cost of transporting goods globally; 

Acts
 of war, terrorist attacks, outbreaks of contagious disease and other events over which we have no control; and 

Changes
 in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs,
 duties, taxes, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. 

Any
of these risks could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or growth strategy. Furthermore, some of
our international operations are conducted in parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Our employees and wholesalers
could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations,
could have an adverse impact on our reputation, our results of operations or our financial position. 

Foreign
exchange movements may also negatively affect the relative purchasing power of consumers and their willingness to purchase discretionary
premium goods, such as our products, which would adversely affect our net sales. We do not currently use the derivative markets to hedge
foreign currency fluctuations. 

The
growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategy, and our efforts to expand internationally by growing
our e-commerce business. 

We
are focused on developing an integrated Play and Learn platform under our Connexa brand. The Platform will bring together our owned offerings
of Gameface and Slinger Bag under the umbrella of the Connexa brand. We believe our success will in large part depend on our ability
to develop a cohesive platform that integrates elements of performance analysis from each. We may face difficulties integrating the technology
and offerings from each brand in order create a cohesive business. For example, users of the Slinger Bag may view us a sporting goods
company and choose not to engage with our technology offerings from the Gameface brand, and users of our Gameface AI app services may
not purchase our ball launchers. 

Our
current growth strategy depends on our ability to continue to expand our reach geographically in a number of international regions in
Asia, Europe, North America, Africa and Australia. This growth strategy is contingent upon our ability to introduce our products
to new markets. The implementation of higher tariffs, quotas or other restrictive trade policies in any international regions in which
we seek to operate could adversely affect our ability to commence new international operations, which could have an adverse impact on
our growth strategy. Further, consumer demand behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ in various countries and,
as a result, sales of our products may not be, or may take time to become, successful, and gross margins on those net sales may not be
in line with what we currently experience. Our ability to execute our international growth strategy, especially where we are not yet
established, depends on our ability to understand regional market demographics, and we may not be able to do so. 

If
we are unable to develop the integrated Play and Learn platform and expand our business internationally, our growth strategy and our
financial results could be materially adversely affected. 

16 

If
we are unable to respond effectively to changes in market trends and consumer preferences, our market share, net sales and profitability
could be adversely affected. 

The
success of our business depends on our ability to identify the key product and market trends and bring products to market in a timely
manner that satisfy the current preferences of a broad range of consumers (either by enhancing existing products or by developing new
product offerings). Consumer preferences differ across and within different parts of the world, and shift over time in response to changing
aesthetics and economic circumstances. We believe that our success in developing products that are innovative and that meet our consumers 
functional needs is an important factor in our image as a premium brand, and in our ability to charge premium prices. We may not be able
to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences, and, even if we do anticipate and respond to such changes, we may not be
able to bring to market in a timely manner enhanced or new products that meet these changing preferences. If we fail to anticipate or
respond to changes in consumer preferences or fail to bring products to market in a timely manner that satisfy new preferences, our market
share and our net sales and profitability could be adversely affected. 

We
may be unable to appeal to new consumers while maintaining the loyalty of our core consumers. 

Part
of our growth strategy is to introduce new consumers, including young consumers, to our brands. If we are unable to attract new consumers,
including young consumers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as our core consumers age increases
and purchasing frequency decrease. Initiatives and strategies intended to position our brand to appeal to new and young consumers may
not appeal to our core consumers and may diminish the appeal of our brand to our core consumers, resulting in reduced core consumer loyalty.
If we are unable to successfully appeal to new and young consumers while maintaining our brand s image with our core consumers,
then our net sales and our brand image may be adversely affected. 

Our
business could suffer if we are unable to maintain our website or manage our inventory effectively. 

We
employ a distribution strategy that is heavily dependent upon our website and third-party distributors e-commerce websites. The
effectiveness of our e-commerce strategy depends on our ability to manage our inventory and our distribution processes effectively so
as to ensure that our products are available in sufficient quantities and thereby prevent lost sales. If we are not able to maintain
our e-commerce channels, or if we are not able to effectively manage our inventory, we could experience a decline in net sales, as well
as excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. In addition, the failure to deliver our products
to customers in accordance with our delivery schedules could damage our relationship with these customers and lead to negative feedback
being posted on e-commerce sites. Consequently, our net sales, profitability and the implementation of our growth strategy could be adversely
affected. 

We
plan to use cash provided by operating activities to fund our expanding business and execute our growth strategy and may require additional
capital, which may not be available to us. 

We
expect our business to rely on net cash provided by our future operating activities as our primary source of liquidity. To support our
business and execute our growth strategy as planned, we will need to generate significant amounts of cash from operations in order to
purchase inventory, pay personnel, invest in research and development, and pay for the increased costs associated with operating as a
public company. Operating cash flows were weak earlier this year and, as a result, we had to significantly curtail operations and dispose
of our PlaySight and Foundation Sports operations. See Item1. Business Recent Developments for more information.
If our business does not generate cash flow from operating activities sufficient to fund these activities, and if sufficient funds are
not otherwise available to us, we will need to seek additional capital, through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. Conditions
in the credit markets (such as availability of finance and fluctuations in interest rates) may make it difficult for us to obtain such
financing on attractive terms or even at all. Additional debt financing that we may undertake, may be expensive and might impose on us
covenants that restrict our operations and strategic initiatives, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt,
pay dividends, repurchase our capital stock, make investments and engage in merger, consolidation and asset sale transactions. Equity
financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our shareholders, and the prices at which new investors would
be willing to purchase our equity securities may be lower than the price per share of our common stock. The holders of new securities
may also have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing
are required, but are unattractive, insufficient or unavailable, then we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based
on available funding, if any, which would inhibit our growth and could harm our business. 

17 

Our
extended supply chain requires long lead times and relies heavily on manufacturers in Asia. 

We
rely heavily on manufacturers in Asia, which requires long lead times to get goods to markets. The long lead times will require us to
carry extra inventory to avoid out-of-stock scenarios. In the event of a decline in demand for our products, due to general economic
conditions or other factors, we may be forced to liquidate this extra inventory at lower margins or at a loss. In addition, consumers 
tastes can change between the time a product is designed and the time it takes to get to market. If the designs are not popular with
consumers, it could also result in the need to liquidate the inventories at lower margins or at a loss, which would adversely affect
our results of operations. 

We
depend on existing members of management and key employees to implement key elements in our strategy for growth, and the failure to retain
them or to attract appropriately qualified new personnel could affect our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully. 

The
successful implementation of our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees
and on our ability to attract appropriately qualified new personnel. For instance, our chief executive officer has extensive experience
running branded sporting goods. The loss of any key member of our management team or other key employees could hinder or delay our ability
to implement our growth strategy effectively. Further, if we are unable to attract appropriately qualified new personnel, including a
chief financial officer, we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy. In either instance, our profitability and financial
performance could be adversely affected. 

We
do not employ traditional advertising channels, and if we fail to adequately market our brand through product introductions and other
means of promotion, our business could be adversely affected. 

Our
marketing strategy depends on our ability to promote our brand s message by using online advertising and social media, and possibly
the use of newspapers and magazines to promote new product introductions in a cost-effective manner. We do not employ traditional advertising
channels such as billboards, television and radio. If our marketing efforts are not successful at attracting new consumers and increasing
purchasing frequency by our existing consumers, there may be no cost-effective marketing channels available to us for the promotion of
our brand. If we increase our spending on advertising, or initiate spending on traditional advertising, our expenses will rise, and our
advertising efforts may not be successful. In addition, if we are unable to successfully and cost-effectively employ advertising channels
to promote our brand to new consumers and new markets, our growth strategy may be adversely affected. 

We
rely significantly on information technology to operate our business. Any significant security breach of our confidential information
of our customers, applications, technology, networks, or other systems critical to our operations, or failure to comply with privacy
and security laws and regulations could damage our reputation, brands and business. 

We
are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services Information
Technology Systems ), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation,
sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, operations and
other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes
and they may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain
our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology
Systems. We rely on a third party systems provider to manage all our company data and transactions, record our financial transactions
and manage our operations. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses,
hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair
or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced
efficiency of our operations, could require additional capital to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities,
and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. 

18 

We
also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and
to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption
or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we
could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational
damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce,
consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic
communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers,
vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result
in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users. 

In
connection with various facets of our business, we collect and use a variety of personal data related to our customers. Our failure to
prevent security breaches could damage our reputation and brands and substantially harm our business and results of operations. On our
website, a majority of the sales are billed to our consumers credit card accounts directly, orders are shipped to a consumer s
address, and consumers log on using their email address. In such transactions, maintaining complete security for the transmission of
confidential information on our website, such as consumers credit card numbers and expiration dates, personal information and
billing addresses is essential to maintaining consumer confidence. In addition, we hold certain private information about our consumers,
such as their names, addresses, phone numbers and browsing and purchasing records. We rely on encryption and authentication technology
licensed from third parties to effect the secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Advances in
computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the
technology used by us to protect consumer transaction data. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a user s password
could potentially access the user s transaction data or personal information. We may not be able to prevent third parties, such
as hackers or criminal organizations, from stealing information provided by our consumers to us through our website. In addition, our
third-party merchants and delivery service providers may violate their confidentiality obligations and disclose information about our
consumers. Any compromise of our security or material violation of a non-disclosure obligation could damage our reputation and brand
and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.
In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions
in our operations. 

Moreover,
the platform and applications that we use to operate our business are highly technical and complex and may now or in the future contain
undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our code may only be discovered after the code has been deployed. Any errors,
bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after deployment, inability to identify the cause or causes of performance problems within
an acceptable period of time or difficultly maintaining and improving the performance of our platform, particularly during peak usage
times, could result in damage to our reputation or brand, loss of revenues, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect
our business and financial results. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed
and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business
and operating results may be harmed. 

Global
economic, political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. 

We
are a global company with worldwide operations. Volatile economic, political and market conditions, such as political or economic instability,
civil unrest, trade sanctions, acts of terrorism in the regions or hostilities, including the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine,
in which we operate may have a negative impact on our operating results and our ability to achieve our business objectives. We may not
have insight into economic and political trends that could emerge and negatively affect our business. In addition, significant or volatile
changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon our liquidity, revenues,
costs and operating results. 

Additionally,
natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as extreme weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine War, could
have a significant adverse effect on our business, including interruption of our business operations, supply chain disruption, endangerment
of our personnel, and other delays or losses of materials and results. 

19 

The
Russian-Ukrainian Conflict may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results. 

In
February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. The specific impact on our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows is not determinable as of the date hereof. However, to the extent that such
military action spreads to other countries, intensifies, or otherwise remains active, such action could have an impact on the broader
macroeconomic impact and therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows. If the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues, the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions could impose
wider economic and trade sanctions as well as export restrictions, which could impact our business opportunities. In addition, our contractors
may take actions in violation of such policies and applicable law, and we could be held ultimately responsible. If we are held responsible
for a violation of U.S. or other countries sanctions laws, we may be subject to various penalties, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our
products face intense competition. 

We
are a sports equipment and technology company delivering products and technologies and the relative popularity of tennis, pickleball
and padel tennis and other various sports activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The sports equipment
industry and sports-related technology industry are both are highly competitive both in the U.S. and worldwide. We compete internationally
with a significant number of athletic and sports equipment companies and sports-related technology companies, including sports-related
technology companies, including large companies having diversified lines of athletic and sports equipment and sports technology products.
We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our online digital
e-commerce operations compete with brand wholesalers or specialist retailers. 

Product
offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production,
customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes
in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and sports equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.
In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital
commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our online and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and
respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly. 

The
AI-based technology market is new and unproven, and it may decline or experience limited growth, which would adversely affect our ability
to fully realize the potential of our platforms. 

The
AI-based technology market is relatively new and evaluating the size and scope of the market is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
We believe that our future success will depend in large part on the continued growth of this market. The utilization of our app platform
by users is untested, and users may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, this app platform, which may prompt them to cease use
of our platform or decide to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy their cognitive computing search and analytics requirements.
In order to expand our business and extend our market position, we intend to focus our marketing and sales efforts on educating users
about the benefits and technological capabilities of our platforms and the applications of our platform to the specific needs of customers
in different market verticals. Our ability to access and expand the market that our platform is designed to address depends upon a number
of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value of our platforms. Market opportunity estimates are subject to significant
uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis and industry experience. The market for our platform
may fail to grow significantly or be unable to meet the level of growth we expect. As a result, we may experience lower-than-expected
demand for our products and services due to lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, decreases
in spending by current and prospective customers, weakening economic conditions and other causes. If our market does not experience significant
growth, or if demand for our products does not increase in line with our projections, then our business, results of operations and financial
condition will be adversely affected. 

20 

We
rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products. 

Research
and development plays a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of electrical and mechanical engineering,
industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products.
While we strive to produce products that help to enhance player performance, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products,
consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial
expense to remedy the problems. 

With
the acquisition of Gameface, we are slowly transforming from a sports products only company to offering an additional sports technology
platform focused on the Play Learn Platform. If we are unable to successfully integrate this new technology with our existing products,
we may not realize the benefits of the Gameface acquisition and / or our relationships with Foundation, and our business may be materially
adversely affected. 

Prior
to our acquisition of Gameface, we focused on the production and sale of the Slinger Bag. Now our focused has shifted to the Play and
Learn integrated platform which includes the analysis and AI offered by Gameface. The Play and Learn Platform requires integration of
the capabilities of our existing business with those of Gameface. we may not realize the benefits of the Gameface acquisition and our
business may be materially adversely affected. 

Failure
to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. 

We
establish relationships with professional athletes, as well as other public figures such as teaching pros and influencers, to develop,
evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry
has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are
unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we
could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially
increase our marketing investments. Any substantial deterioration in these relationships, or substantial deterioration of our relationship
with their talent managers or other key personnel, could adversely affect our business. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses
and profitability could be harmed. If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our
business could be adversely affected. 

Actions
taken by athletes or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes or endorsers, could also
seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. 

Actions
taken by athletes or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes or endorsers, could also
seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Poor
performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify future athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to
use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures,
and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. We are also subject to laws, regulations and industry
standards relating to endorsements and influencer marketing. Many of these laws, regulations and industry standards are changing and
may be subject to differing interpretations, are costly to comply with or inconsistent among jurisdictions. 

Our
business may be affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. 

We
expect to experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. We expect revenues in the first and fourth fiscal
quarters to exceed those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to
time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for tennis and other sports equipment and in connection with the timing
of significant sporting events, such as any Grand Slam tennis tournament and, over time, other sports competitions. In addition, our
customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may
not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from
period to period. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing
and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations
in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. 

21 

We
may be adversely affected by the financial health of our third-party internet partners, wholesale purchasers, retailers, and distributors. 

We
extend credit to our distributors and to a select number of third party internet partners based on an assessment of a customer s
financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products,
we offer our distributor partners the opportunity to place orders three months ahead of delivery under our direct ship ordering program.
These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially
unstable distribution partners struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some sports customers have experienced financial difficulties
up to and including bankruptcies. Such future events would have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables
and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, distributors may be more cautious with orders.
A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have
an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality
digital advertising and merchandising to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by the company, our distributors and
our third party internet partners. Distributors or partners that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments
or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. 

Failure
to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating
margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. 

There
is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result
in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our
products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products, we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages.
Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish
brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our
net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. 

Consolidation
of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our
ability to sell products. 

The
sports equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers
have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations
concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage
of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to
us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region
increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient
number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues. 

If
the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results,
as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. 

Many
of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications
to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary
mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide
attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery
options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in
the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our
digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Risks specific
to our digital commerce business also include liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might
adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. Many factors unique to e-commerce
operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to, credit card fraud
or data mismanagement. 

22 

Our
products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing. 

The
principal materials used in our products (e.g., injection molded plastics, polyester, electrical motors, remote controls, trolley bags)
are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. Our products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract
manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. Our contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject
to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured. 

There
could be a significant disruption in the supply of raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract
manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all.
Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases
in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain
metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able
to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials,
or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing
capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient
capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources
of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers
in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs
in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail
customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term. 

Because
independent manufacturers make all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third
parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation,
work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning
between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our
products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our
profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum
products can adversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs
and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could
adversely affect our results of operations. 

Our
financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. 

From
time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and
expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management
attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments
are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of
any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results
and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. 

Our
business is sensitive to consumer spending and general economic conditions. 

Our
business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, as well as macro-economic conditions such as inflation,
employment levels, wage and salary levels, trends in consumer confidence and spending, reductions in consumer net worth, interest rates,
inflation, the availability of consumer credit and taxation policies influence on public spending confidence. Recent dramatic downturns
in the strength of global stock markets, currencies and key economies have highlighted many if not all, of these risks. 

23 

Consumer
purchases in general may decline during recessions, periods of prolonged declines in the equity markets or housing markets and periods
when disposable income and perceptions of consumer wealth are lower, and these risks may be exacerbated for us due to our focus on discretionary
premium sporting good items. A downturn in the global economy, or in a regional economy in which we have significant sales, could have
a material, adverse effect on consumer purchases of our products, our results of operations and our financial position, and a downturn
adversely affecting our consumer base or travelers could have a disproportionate impact on our business. 

There
continues to be a significant and growing volatility and uncertainty in the global economy due to the Coronavirus pandemic affecting
all business sectors and industries. In addition, the on-going uncertainty in Europe and any resulting disruption could adversely impact
our net sales in Europe and globally unless and until economic conditions in that region improve and the prospects of national debt defaults
in Europe decline. Further or future downturns may adversely affect traffic at our on-line sales portals (which currently includes our
own website https://www.connexasports.com/ and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and
growth strategy. 

Likewise,
the current impasse in U.S.-China trade relations has resulted in import duties for all Slinger products into the U.S. being increased
from the previous standard of 5 to 30 . Our management has taken the view that at this time, gaining distribution and share outweighs
the immediate margin consideration and has decided to take the added increase in import tariffs as a margin loss. 

There
is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern absent obtaining adequate new debt or equity financing and
achieving sufficient sales levels. 

The
Company s management has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern
and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended April
30, 2023 and 2022 included an explanatory paragraph with respect to the foregoing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan. This determination was based on the following factors:
(i) the Company has a working capital deficit as of April 30, 2023, used cash in operations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023
of 6,365,389 and the Company s available cash as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund its anticipated
level of operations for the next 12 months; (ii) the Company will require additional financing for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2023
to continue at its expected level of operations; and (iii) if the Company fails to obtain the needed capital, it will be forced to delay,
scale back, or eliminate some or all of its development activities or perhaps cease operations. In the opinion of management, these factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern as of the date of the end of the
period covered by this report and for one year from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. 

We
have limited financial resources. Our independent registered auditors report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
a result of our deficiency in working capital on April 30, 2023 and other factors, our auditors have included a paragraph in their audit
report regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans in this regard are to increase product
sales, increase production, obtain inventory financing, seek strategic alternatives and to seek additional capital through future equity
private placements or debt facilities. 

We
have recorded net losses since inception and have significant accumulated deficits. We have relied upon loans and equity financings for
operating capital. Total revenues will be insufficient to pay off existing debt and fund operations. We may be required to rely on further
debt financing, further loans from related parties, and private placements of our common stock for our additional cash needs. Such funding
sources may not be available, or the terms of such funding sources may not be acceptable to the Company. 

24 

We
will need additional capital in the future to finance our planned growth, which we may not be able to raise or it may only be available
on terms unfavorable to us or our stockholders, which may result in our inability to fund our working capital requirements and harm our
operational results. 

We
have and expect to continue to have substantial working capital needs. Our cash on hand, together with cash generated from product sales,
services, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the
next twelve months. In fact, we will be required to raise additional funds throughout 2023 or we will need to limit operations until
such time as we can raise substantial funds to meet our working capital needs. In addition, we will need to raise additional funds to
fund our operations and implement our growth strategy, or to respond to competitive pressures and/or perceived opportunities, such as
investment, acquisition, marketing and development activities. 

If
we experience operating difficulties or other factors, many of which may be beyond our control, cause our revenues or cash flows from
operations, if any, to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to spend the capital necessary to complete our development, marketing
and growth programs. We require additional financing, in addition to anticipated cash generated from our operations, to fund our working
capital requirements. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds were not available
or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop
or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In such a capital restricted situation,
we may curtail our marketing, development, and operational activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable
basis. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated
to the public. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive
and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors of the Company (the Board of Directors ), management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
 authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Our
internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision. 

Failure
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to
lose confidence in our reported financial information, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business,
financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 

However,
our auditors will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to
Section 404 until we are no longer a smaller reporting company . 

25 

The
costs of being a public company could result in us being unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
a public company, we are required to comply with numerous financial reporting and legal requirements, including those pertaining to audits
and internal control. The costs of maintaining public company reporting requirements could be significant and may preclude us from seeking
financing or equity investment on terms acceptable to us and our shareholders. We estimate these costs to be in excess of 500,000 per
year and may be higher if our business volume or business activity increases significantly. Our current estimate of costs does not include
the necessary expenses associated with compliance, documentation and specific reporting requirements of Section 404 as we will not be
subject to the full reporting requirements of Section 404 until we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company . 

If
our revenues are insufficient or non-existent, and/or we cannot satisfy many of these costs through the issuance of shares or debt, we
may be unable to satisfy these costs in the normal course of business. This would certainly result in our being unable to continue as
a going concern. 

If
we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, then the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure
of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal
controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely
affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management s
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal
controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions
that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management s assessment of our internal
controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 

Any
acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition. 

We
have in the past made (and may, from time to time, consider) acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. A primary
component of our growth strategy has been to acquire complementary businesses to grow our Company. For example, we acquired the business
of Foundation Sports Systems, LLC, in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, and the acquisitions of PlaySight and Gameface closed in
the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022. In the Company s fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023, the Company divested PlaySight and
75 of its interest in Foundation Sports as the required monthly cash burn became increasingly difficult to manage as inflation rose
and the cost of manufacturing the Company s non-technological products grew. As a result, the Company sold PlaySight back to its
original owners of in November 2022, and the Company sold most (75 of Foundation Tennis back to their original owners, with an option
to purchase any remaining interests. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and businesses
as a primary component of our growth strategy to enhance the features and functionality of our applications, expand our customer base
and provide access to new markets and increase benefits of scale. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the
assimilation of the acquired businesses, the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and potential
adverse effects on existing business relationships could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations.
In addition, any acquisitions could involve the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we pursue or that such acquisitions will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial
to our operations and cash flow. Any such failure could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, there might be potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing
of the products to new and existing customers. 

Some
aspects of our business processes include open-source software, which poses risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open-source
licenses could negatively affect our business. 

We
incorporate open-source software into processes supporting our business and anticipate using open- source software in the future. Such
open-source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License. The terms of
various open-source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses
could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our systems, limits our
use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of our systems and negatively affects our business operations. 

26 

Some
open-source licenses contain requirements that we make source code modifications or derivative works we create publicly available or
make such modifications or derivative works available on unfavorable terms or at no cost, depending on the type of open-source software
used. 

While
we monitor our use of open-source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary
source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open-source license, such use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed
to have occurred, in part because open-source license terms are often ambiguous. We may face claims from third parties claiming ownership
of, or demanding the release or license of, modifications or derivative works that we have developed using such open-source software
(which could include our proprietary source code or artificial intelligence AI models), or otherwise seeking to enforce
the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation and if portions of our proprietary AI models
or software are determined to be subject to an open-source license, or if the license terms for the open-source software that we incorporate
change, we could be required to publicly release all or affected portions of our source code, purchase a costly license, cease offering
the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer such source code in a manner that avoids infringement, discontinue
or delay the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or change our business activities,
any of which could negatively affect our business operations and potentially our intellectual property rights. In addition, the re-engineering
process could require us to expend significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete the
re-engineering process successfully. If we were required to publicly disclose any portion of our proprietary models, it is possible we
could lose the benefit of trade secret protection for our models. 

In
addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than the use of
third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, controls or
other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the origin of the software. There is little legal precedent
in this area, and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could
harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better
than ours. Use of open-source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may
make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our website and systems that rely on open-source software.
Any of these risks associated with the use of open-source software could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and if not addressed, could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Systems
defects, failures or disruptions, including events beyond our control, and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites,
applications, products, or services could harm our business, harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us, decrease our potential
profitability and expose us to substantial liability. 

We
use vendors, such as our cloud computing web services provider and third-party software providers, in the operation of our platform.
The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network and infrastructure are critical
to our operations and reputation and the ability of our platform to attract new and retain existing customers. We rely on these vendors
to protect their systems and facilities against damage or service interruptions from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures,
air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm these systems, criminal acts, unauthorized access,
sabotage, acts of vandalism, military actions, negligence, human errors, fraud, spikes in platform use and denial of service issues,
hardware failures, improper operation, cyberattacks, data loss, wars and similar events. If our arrangement with a vendor is terminated
or if there is a lapse of service or damage to its systems or facilities, we could experience interruptions in our ability to operate
our platform. We also may experience increased costs and difficulties in replacing that vendor and replacement services may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. 

27 

In
addition, our platform may be accessed by many users at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our users, and products
and services available through our platform, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements.
The failure of data centers, internet service providers or other third- party service providers to meet our capacity requirements could
result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to grow our business and scale our operations. Any
interruptions or delays in our platform availability, whether as a result of a failure to perform on the part of a vendor, any damage
to one of our vendor s systems or facilities, the termination of any of our third-party vendor agreements, software failures, our
or our vendor s error, natural disasters, terrorism, other man-made problems, security breaches, whether accidental or willful,
or other factors, could harm our relationships with our customers, prevent our customers from accessing their accounts, damage our reputation
with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, cause the loss of critical data, prevent us
from supporting our platform, products or services or cause us to incur additional expense in arranging for new facilities and support
or otherwise harm our business and also harm our reputation. 

In
addition, we source certain information from third parties. In the event that any third party from which we source information experiences
a service disruption, whether as a result of maintenance, natural disasters, terrorism, or security breaches, whether accidental or willful,
or other factors, the ability to access our platform may be adversely impacted. Additionally, there may be errors contained in the information
provided by third parties. This may result in the inability to approve otherwise qualified applicants through our platform, which may
adversely impact our business by negatively impacting our reputation and reducing our transaction volume. 

To
the extent we use or are dependent on any particular third-party data, technology, or software, we may also be harmed if such data, technology,
or software becomes non-compliant with existing regulations or industry standards, becomes subject to third-party claims of intellectual
property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or malfunctions or functions in a way we did not anticipate. Any loss of
the right to use any of this data, technology, or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until
equivalent or replacement data, technology, or software is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained, and integrated,
and there is no guarantee that we would be successful in developing, identifying, obtaining, or integrating equivalent or similar data,
technology, or software, which could result in the loss or limiting of our products, services, or features available in our products
or services. 

Our
ability to sell our products and services will be dependent on the quality of our technical support and our failure to deliver high-quality
technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. 

If
we do not effectively assist our users in deploying our products and services, succeed in helping our users quickly resolve post-deployment
issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able to achieve the foregoing, our
ability to sell our products and services would be adversely affected, and our reputation with potential users could be harmed. In addition,
if we expand our operations internationally, our technical support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with
delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than the English language. As a result, our failure to deliver and
maintain high-quality technical support services to our users could result in customers choosing to use our competitors products
or services in the future. 

Our
Gameface products and services may fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. 

The
market in which Gameface operates is characterized by rapid, and sometimes disruptive, technological developments, evolving industry
standards, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changes in user requirements. In addition, both traditional and new
competitors are investing heavily in our market areas and competing for users. As next-generation video analytics technology continues
to evolve, we must keep pace in order to maintain or expand our market position. If we are not able to successfully add staff resources
with sufficient technical skills to develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, achieve market acceptance of our products
and services or identify new market opportunities for our products and services, our business and results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected. 

28 

The
business-to-business e-commerce industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively. 

The
market for business-to-business B2B e-commerce solutions is rapidly changing and intensely competitive. We expect competition
to intensify as the number of entrants and new technologies increases. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or
future competitors. The competitive pressures facing us may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

If
we are not able to enhance or introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 

Our
ability to attract new users and increase revenue from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our platforms,
increase adoption and usage of our products and introduce new products and features. The success of any enhancements or new products
depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual performance quality, market-accepted pricing
levels and overall market acceptance and demand. Enhancements and new products that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective
manner, may contain defects, may have interoperability difficulties with our platform, or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary
to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing platform and capabilities to meet evolving customer
requirements, increase adoption and usage of our platform, develop new products, or if our efforts to increase the usage of our products
are more expensive than we expect, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 

Customers
may experience difficulty in integrating Gameface with third-party applications, which would inhibit sales. 

Gameface
may serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware, operating system software, packaged software applications
and networking platforms. If Gameface fails to gain broad market acceptance due to its inability to support a variety of these platforms,
our operating results may suffer. Our business depends, in part, on the following factors: 

Our
 ability to integrate Gameface with multiple platforms and existing systems and to modify our product as new versions of packaged
 applications are introduced; 

Access
 to application program interfaces for the third-party software products that are integrated with our products; and 

Our
 ability to anticipate and support new standards. 

Lack
of cooperation from Vendors of the software we use in Gameface and other products may interfere with the use of Gameface apps and inhibit
our business 

Application
program interfaces provide the instructions that are required to transfer information into and out of an application and trigger the
specific characteristics of that application. These instructions are needed to create adapters between Gameface and third-party software
products, but access to application program interfaces is controlled by the vendors of these applications. If the application vendor
denies or delays our access to application program interfaces, our business may be harmed. Some application vendors may become competitors
or establish alliances with our competitors, increasing the likelihood that we would not be granted access to their application program
interfaces. Furthermore, we may need to modify Gameface or develop new adapters in the future as new applications or newer versions of
existing applications are introduced. If we fail to continue to develop adapters or respond to new applications or newer versions of
existing applications in a timely manner, our business could suffer. 

29 

Risks
Related to the Company s Legal and Regulatory Requirements 

Failure
to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brand and negatively affect
our sales. 

Our
trademarks, copyrights, patents, designs and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position.
We devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and patents. In spite of our efforts, counterfeiting
and design copies may still occur. If we are unsuccessful in challenging the usurpation of these rights by third parties, this could
adversely affect our future sales, financial condition and results of operations. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights
can potentially be met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights.
Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could result in higher
operating expenses. Additionally, legal regimes outside the U.S., particularly those in Asia, including China, may not always protect
intellectual property rights to the same degree as U.S. laws, or the time required to enforce our intellectual property rights under
these legal regimes may be lengthy and delay our recovery. 

We
may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result
in litigation and adversely affect our business. 

A
significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees, or outside consultants in the course of their employment
or retention with us. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, inventions conceived by an employee during the scope
of his or her employment with a company are regarded as service inventions. The Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee,
or the Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, has previously held, in certain cases, that employees may be entitled to remuneration
for service inventions that they develop during their service for a company despite their explicit waiver of such right. Therefore, we
may face claims by employees demanding remuneration beyond their regular salary and benefits. 

We
may be subject to product liability lawsuits or claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to
successfully defend or insure against such claims. 

We
may be subject to product liability lawsuits and claims that, individually or in the aggregate, could harm our business, prospects, results
of operations and financial condition. We may face lawsuits or claims if our products do not perform as expected, malfunction or are
used without complying with their specifications. Moreover, a product liability lawsuit or claim, regardless of merit, could generate
negative publicity about our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects, results of operations
and financial condition. Any lawsuit or claim seeking monetary damages significantly exceeding our coverage or outside of our coverage
may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

If
we provide products and services related to sports betting, our business may become subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many
of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. Any adverse change in
regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to these contemplated products and services, or changes in
tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to these contemplated products and services, could adversely impact our ability
to operate our business as we seek to operate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. 

Our
business could potentially expand into sports betting, in which case our business partners are generally subject to laws and regulations
in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business or in some circumstances, of those jurisdictions in which we offer our services
or those are available, as well as the general laws and regulations that apply to all e-commerce businesses, such as those related to
privacy and personal information, tax and consumer protection. These laws and regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another and future
legislative and regulatory action, court decisions or other governmental action, which may be affected by, among other things, political
pressures, attitudes and climates, as well as personal biases, may at such time have a material impact on our operations and financial
results, or may prevent our business partners from expanding into such businesses entirely and thus, may have impact on our business.
In addition, some jurisdictions in which we may operate could presently be unregulated or partially regulated and therefore more susceptible
to the enactment or change of laws and regulations. 

As
a result of the foregoing, future legislative and regulatory action, and court decisions or other governmental action, may have a material
impact on our business partners business and operations, and that may also have an impact on our operations and financial results.
Governmental authorities could view us as having violated local laws, despite efforts to obtain all applicable licenses or approvals.
There is also a risk that civil and criminal proceedings, including class actions brought by or on behalf of prosecutors or public entities
or incumbent monopoly providers, or private individuals, could be initiated against our business partners, us, and others involved in
the sports betting industry. Such potential proceedings could involve substantial litigation expense, penalties, fines, seizure of assets,
injunctions or other restrictions being imposed upon us or our business partners. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as impact our reputation. 

Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that legally enforceable legislation will not be proposed and passed in jurisdictions relevant or potentially
relevant to our business to prohibit, legislate or regulate various aspects of the sports betting industry (or that existing laws in
those jurisdictions will not be interpreted negatively). Compliance with any such legislation may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations, either as a result of our determination not to offer products or services in
a jurisdiction or to cease doing so, or because a local license or approval may be costly for us or our business partners to obtain and/or
such licenses or approvals may contain other commercially undesirable conditions. 

Fluctuations
in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may have a negative effect on our operating results. 

We
may be subject to income taxes in multiple jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include
reserves for uncertain tax provisions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various
taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these
issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur
and exposures are evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial period may be materially impacted by changes in mix
and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. In addition, tax legislation enacted in the future could
negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. 

We
do not have covenants not to compete in place with our key employees. 

We
generally do not enter into non-competition agreements as part of our employment agreements with our employees and it may be difficult
for us to restrict our competitors from benefitting from the expertise our former employees or consultants developed while working for
us. 

31 

We
could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective
tax rate. 

We
are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and
regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S.
enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), which includes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws
that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction
in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions
U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on
non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation. 

We
earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been
proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.
Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law,
could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. 

Portions
of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings. We also utilize tax rulings
and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from
time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes
in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. 

We
may also be subject to the examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities.
We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes
could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could
have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.
For example, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although
we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place,
tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates. 

To
the extent we may rely on endorsements or testimonials, we will review any relevant relationships for compliance with the Endorsement
Guides and we will otherwise endeavor to follow the FTC Act and other legal standards applicable to our advertising . 

The
FTC regulates the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising as well as relationships between advertisers and social media influencers
pursuant to principles described in the FTC s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or the
Endorsement Guides. The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and cannot be
used to make a claim about a product that the product s marketer couldn t itself legally make. They also say that if there
is a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement,
that connection should be disclosed. Another principle in the Endorsement Guides applies to ads that feature endorsements from people
who achieved exceptional, or even above average, results from using a product. If the advertiser doesn t have proof that the endorser s
experience represents what people will generally achieve using the product as described in the ad, then an ad featuring that endorser
must make clear to the audience what results they can generally expect to achieve and the advertiser must have a reasonable basis for
its representations regarding those generally expected results. Although the Endorsement Guides are advisory in nature and do not operate
directly with the force of law, they provide guidance about what the FTC staff generally believes the Federal Trade Commission Act, or
FTC Act, requires in the context using of endorsements and testimonials in advertising and any practices inconsistent with the Endorsement
Guides can result in violations of the FTC Act s proscription against unfair and deceptive practices. 

32 

To
the extent we may rely on endorsements or testimonials, we will review any relevant relationships for compliance with the Endorsement
Guides and we will otherwise endeavor to follow the FTC Act and other legal standards applicable to our advertising. However, if our
advertising claims or claims made by our social media influencers or by other endorsers with whom we have a material connection do not
comply with the Endorsement Guides or any requirement of the FTC Act or similar state requirements, the FTC and state consumer protection
authorities could subject us to investigations and enforcement actions, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress,
require us to revise our marketing materials and require us to accept burdensome injunctions, all of which could harm our business, reputation,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Failure
of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with local laws and other standards could harm our business. 

We
work with contractors outside of the U.S. to manufacture our products. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products
and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply
with environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable
standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time-to-time contractors may not comply with such standards
or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant
or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product
recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods,
alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand
image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses. 

We
could be subject to a change in tax laws, which may impact tax rates or otherwise adversely impact our tax position and may be subject
to a tax audit. 

We
are subject to the tax laws in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Such laws may change as a result of economic and political
conditions, or there may be changes to such laws interpretation and application. 

We
earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been
proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.
Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law,
could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. 

We
are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

As
a global business, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which
we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with any of
these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation,
business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings
and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including
contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur
judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and
compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy and other regulatory matters,
will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect
us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result
in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management s
attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. 

33 

For
as long as we are a smaller reporting company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements that
apply to other publicly reporting companies. We cannot predict whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting
companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors. 

We
are currently a smaller reporting company . For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may choose
to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements applicable to other publicly reporting companies that are not smaller
reporting companies. These include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements for the assessment of our internal
controls over financial reporting provided by Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and not being
required to provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger publicly reporting companies. We cannot predict
if investors will find our common shares less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common
shares less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our shares
and our share price may be more volatile. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure may be more limited
than that of other publicly reporting companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies. 

We
are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection
with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. 

We
are required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm will have to review our financial statements
on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist
in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this
time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined
at this time and will affect the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will
obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a
profit. 

However,
for as long as we remain a smaller reporting company, as defined in in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012,
or JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
and proxy statements. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. 

If
we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose
confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. 

Risks
Related to Ownership of Our Shares 

There
is currently limited liquidity of shares of our common stock. 

We
can give no assurance that an active trading market for shares of our common stock will develop on the Nasdaq or if its develops, will
be sustained, or that the shares of common stock will trade at or above the public offering price. Failure to develop or maintain a trading
market could negatively affect its value and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares. Even if a market for common
stock does develop, the market price of common stock may be highly volatile. In addition to the uncertainties relating to future operating
performance and the profitability of operations, factors such as variations in interim financial results or various, as yet unpredictable,
factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. The liquidity of the
shares of our common stock may also be affected adversely by a forward stock split given the reduced number of shares that will be outstanding
following a reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the forward stock
split. 

34 

Our
stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you could lose all or part of your investment
as a result. 

You
should consider an investment in our securities to be risky, and you should invest in our securities only if you can withstand a significant
loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our common shares could be subject to significant
fluctuations in response to the factors described in this section and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Among the
factors that could affect our stock price are: 

Actual
 or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results or those of companies perceived to be similar to us; 

Weather
 conditions, particularly during holiday shopping periods; 

Changes
 in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors, or differences
 between our actual results and those expected by investors and securities analysts; 

Fluctuations
 in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 

The
 public s response to our or our competitors filings with the SEC or announcements regarding new products or services,
 enhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic investments, litigation, restructurings or other significant matters; 

Speculation
 about our business in the press or the investment community; 

Future
 sales of our shares; 

Actions
 by our competitors; 

Additions
 or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel; and 

The
 passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry. 

In
addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect
market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions,
such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect
the market price of our shares. 

If
any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even
if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. 

The
trading market for our common shares will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and
our business. The price of our common shares could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common shares or if those
analysts issue a sell recommendation or other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or
more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common shares, our share price could decline rapidly. If one or more of these
analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common share price and trading volume
to decline. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on our shares of common stock and under the terms of certain outstanding loans, we are not permitted to
pay any dividends. 

We
intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do
not anticipate paying cash dividends. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors,
subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, and will depend on, among other factors, our results of operations,
financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, under the terms
of certain loan agreements between the Company and its lenders, the Company, we may not make any distributions until these loan agreements
are repaid in full. At this time, such loans have not been repaid in full. As a result, you should expect to receive a return on your
investment in our common shares only if the market price of our common stock increases, which may never occur. 

35 

Future
sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock. 

As
of April 30, 2023, we had 13,543,155 outstanding common shares. Of these shares, 5,734,294 shares were in the public float. The remaining
7,808,861 shares common stock outstanding were restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144. In addition, on September
8, 2021, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to register an additional 1,640,000 shares of common stock, which was declared
effective on January 27, 2022. On September 28, 2022, we issued (i) 1,018,510 shares of common stock and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the
 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11,802,002 shares of its common stock, together with accompanying common
stock warrants, at a combined purchase price of 0.39 per share of the common stock and associated common stock warrant and 0.3899 per
Pre-Funded Warrant and associated common stock warrants. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of 0.00001 per share of common
stock and are exercisable until the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The shares of common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants were
sold in the offering together with common stock warrants to purchase 12,820,512 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 0.39
per share and a term of five years following the initial exercise date (the 5-Year Warrants and warrants to purchase 25,641,024
shares of common stock at an exercise price of 0.43 per share and a term of seven and one half years (the 7.5-Year Warrants following the initial exercise date (collectively, the September Warrants . On January 6, 2023, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 18,099,548 shares of the Company s common stock (the January Warrants ). The January Warrants have an
exercise price per share equal 0.221. The issuance of the January Warrants at an exercise price of 0.221 reset the exercise price of
the Noteholder Warrants (as defined below) to 0.221 per share from the original exercise price of 30.00. We may have to further reset the exercise price of the September Warrants, the January Warrants and the Noteholder
Warrants to a lower price in the event that we are declared to be in default of the terms of such warrants or related agreements by the
holders thereof and we are required to do in negotiations with the holders of such warrants. Sales of the shares underlying
the Pre-Funded Warrants, the September Warrants, the January Warrants and the Noteholder Warrants in the public market after the date
hereof, or the perception that these sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Additional sales of our common
shares in the public market after the date hereof, or the perception that these sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our
common stock. 

We
will be required to file an additional registration statement once we regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements. 

On
September 8, 2021, we filed a registration statement with the SEC to register 1,640,000 shares of common stock for resale by certain
selling stockholders, which was declared effective on January 27, 2022. Following our public offering resulting in our common stock being
listed on Nasdaq and once we regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards, additional conversion shares need to be registered.
We also have agreed to register additional shares in connection with our recent financing. See Item 1. Business Recent Developments 
for more information. The new registration statement will cover both the shares originally registered for resale, the new conversion
shares and the recent financing shares. 

Certain
of the Company s large shareholders may be able to exert significant influence on the Company and their interests may conflict
with the interests of its other shareholders . 

Certain
of the Company s large shareholders, including our officers and directors, represented approximately 30 of the Company s
voting rights as of April 30, 2023. Therefore, these shareholders would be able to exert significant influence over certain matters,
including matters that must be resolved by the general meeting of shareholders, such as the election of members to the board of directors
or the declaration of dividends or other distributions. To the extent that the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests
of the Company s other shareholders, the Company s other shareholders may be disadvantaged by any actions that these shareholders
may seek to pursue. 

36 

Our
stockholders may not be able to enforce judgments entered by United States courts against certain of our officers and directors. 

We
are incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, some of our directors and executive officers may reside outside of the U.S. As a
result, our stockholders may not be able to effect service of process upon those persons within the U.S. or enforce against those persons
judgments obtained in U.S. courts. 

The
sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal shareholder could depress the market price of our common stock. 

As
of April 30, 2023, Yonah Kalfa beneficially owned approximately 14.7 of our common stock outstanding. The shares may become available
for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these
shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Future
sales of our common stock may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock, even if our business is doing well. 

The
market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception
that such sales could occur. This could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. 

If
we implement a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the Bid-Price Rule, it may not result in a proportional increase in the
per share price of our common stock. 

As
described above under Item 1. Business Recent Developments, Nasdaq informed us on October 10, 2022, that we were
not in compliance with the Bid Price Rule and that we had until April 10, 2023 to regain such compliance. The
Company failed to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by April 10, 2023 and requested and received an additional period of 180
days until October 9, 2023 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To do so, our Board of Directors is contemplating
a 1-for-10 to 1-40 reverse stock split. The effect of a future reverse stock split, if any, on the market price for our common stock
cannot be accurately predicted. In particular, we cannot assure you that the prices for shares of the common stock after a future reverse
stock split will increase proportionately to prices for shares of our common stock immediately before a reverse stock split. The market
price of our common stock may also be affected by other factors which may be unrelated to a future reverse stock split or the number
of shares outstanding. 

Furthermore,
even if the market price of our common stock does rise following a reverse stock split, we cannot assure you that the market price of
our common stock immediately after a reverse stock split will be maintained for any period of time. Moreover, because some investors
may view a reverse stock split negatively, we cannot assure you that a reverse stock split will not adversely impact the market price
of our common stock. Accordingly, our total market capitalization after a reverse stock split may be lower than the market capitalization
before a reverse stock split. 

Shareholders
may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through issuance of additional shares . 

Our
Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized 300,000,000 shares
that are not issued or reserved for issuance under convertible or exchangeable instruments. In addition, we may attempt to raise additional
capital by selling shares, possibly at a deep discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of
existing shareholders, further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. 

A
reverse stock split may not help generate additional investor interest. 

There
can be no assurance that a reverse stock split will result in a per share price that will attract institutional investors or investment
funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the
trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve. 

37 

There
can be no assurances that our common stock will not be subject to potential delisting if we do not regain compliance with the listing
requirements of the Nasdaq. 

We
have listed the shares of our common stock on the Nasdaq, under the symbol CNXA. As such we are subject to, among other
things, our fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the Nasdaq. In addition, Nasdaq has rules for continued listing, including,
without limitation, minimum market capitalization and other requirements. As described above under Item 1. Business Recent
Developments, Nasdaq informed us that we are deficient with respect to several continued listing criteria. Failure to maintain
our listing (i.e., being de-listed from the Nasdaq), would make it more difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock and more
difficult to obtain accurate price quotations on our common stock. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.
Our ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in
the future, may also be materially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange. 

We
have received notices of delinquency from the Nasdaq for violations of listing rules and there is no assurance that we will regain compliance
and maintain our listing on the Nasdaq. 

On
October 10, 2022, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating that the Company s
common stock is subject to potential delisting from Nasdaq because, for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of the
Company s common stock has closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule
5450(a)(1) (the Bid Price Rule ). The Nasdaq notice indicated that, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A),
the Company would be provided 180 calendar days, or until April 10, 2023, to regain compliance. If the Company were to fail to regain
compliance with the Bid Price Rule before April 10, 2023, t he Company may be eligible for an additional
180-calendar day compliance period. The Company failed to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by April 10, 2023 and requested and
received an additional period of 180 days until October 9, 2023 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The
Company is in the process of obtaining shareholder consent to effect a reverse split of its shares of common stock. If granted, the Company
will initiate a reverse split as soon as reasonably practical thereafter in an attempt to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement. 

38 

On
July 26, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that the Company s
stockholders equity as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended January 31, 2023 did not satisfy
the continued listing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires that a listed company s stockholders 
equity be at least 2.5 million (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement ). The Company timely submitted a compliance
plan to the Panel and on August 23, 2023 received notice from Nasdaq that it has until January 22, 2024 to demonstrate compliance with
the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to satisfy the Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, regain compliance with
the Rule, the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement, and the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and maintain compliance with other
Nasdaq listing requirements. If the Company s common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company
would expect that its common stock would be traded on one of the three tiered marketplaces of the OTC Markets Group. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price
and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
us or our business. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company. If no securities
or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock may be negatively impacted. In the event securities
or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or
unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company
or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume
to decline. 

If
our shares of common stock become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares. 

The
SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a price of less than 5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized
for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions
in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not obtain or retain a listing on the Nasdaq and if the price of our
common stock is less than 5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before
a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified
information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser
and receive (i) the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement
to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements
may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have
difficulty selling their shares. 

A
significant portion of our total outstanding shares is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future,
which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. Upon the expiration or early release
of any or all of the lock-up agreements entered into between the Representatives and each of our directors, executive officers and holders
of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock, a significant amount of shares of our common stock may be sold, or there may be a perception
that they will be sold, in the public market. 

Additionally,
upon the (i) expiration of, (ii) early release of, and (iii) terms permitting sales of shares of the Company s common stock at
certain times, a significant amount of shares of our common stock may be sold, or there may be a perception that they will be sold, in
the public market. 

Upon
the sale, or the perception that a sale will occur, as described above, our stock price may decline significantly, even if our business
is doing well.

On
February 8, 2023, Oasis Capital, LLC Oasis filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York seeking damages (i) in the amount of 764,647.53 in for an alleged breach of the terms of the 8 
senior convertible note and the securities purchase agreement entered into between Oasis and the Company in connection with the Note
(as defined below), which in December 2021 was increased to 600,000 in principal amount (the Note and (ii) an unspecified
amount of damage for an alleged breach of the exclusivity provisions of a term sheet that the Company and Oasis entered into on July
7, 2022 plus an actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial, interest and costs, reasonable attorney s fees and such other
legal and equitable relief as the court deems just and proper. On June 30, 2023, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York granted the Company s motion to dismiss this complaint but with leave to amended complaint. On July 31, Oasis filed
an amended complaint against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Mike Ballardie, seeking damages in an amount to be proven at
trial, interest and costs for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Company believes the claims made in the amended complaint are without merit and the Company and
Mike Ballardie are vigorously defending itself. 

Except
for the Oasis lawsuit against Mike Ballardie, we know of no pending proceedings to which any director, member of senior management, or
affiliate is either a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us.

Compensation Plans 

On
November 11, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Slinger Bag Inc. Global Share Incentive Plan (2020), or the 2020
Plan, which was approved by stockholders holding in the aggregate 19,994,700 shares of the Company s common stock, or approximately
75.4 of the Company s common stock outstanding on such date. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of awards which are incentive

stock units, performance stock and other equity-based and cash awards or any combination of the foregoing, to eligible key management

The
Company has reserved a total of 1,500,000 shares for issuance under awards to be made under the 2020 Plan, all of which may, but need
not, be issued in connection with ISOs. To the extent that an award lapses, expires, is canceled, is terminated unexercised or ceases
to be exercisable for any reason, or the rights of its holder terminate, any shares subject to such award shall again be available for
the grant of a new award. The 2020 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
date on which it was adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors in its
discretion may terminate the 2020 Plan at any time with respect to any shares for which awards have not theretofore been granted; provided,
however, that the 2020 Plan s termination shall not materially and adversely impair the rights of a holder, without the consent
of the holder, with respect to any award previously granted. 

41 

Future
new hires, non-employee directors and additional non-employee consultants are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan as well. The number
of awards to be granted to officers, non-employee directors, employees and non-employee consultants cannot be determined at this time
as the grant of awards is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance.

The
operations of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger Bag UK, SBL and Gameface are collectively referred
to as the Company. 

45 

The
Company operates in the sports equipment and technology business. The Company is the owner of the Slinger Bag Launcher, which is comprised
of a portable tennis ball launcher, a portable padel tennis ball launcher and a portable pickleball launcher and Gameface AI, providing
AI technology and performance analytics for sports. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
critical accounting policies relate exclusively to our continuing operations. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America GAAP ). As a result of the transactions described above, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the combined results of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger Bag UK, SBL and Gameface for the
years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Valuation
of Inventory 

Inventory
is valued at the lower of the cost (determined principally on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. The Company s
valuation of inventory includes inventory reserves for inventory that will be sold below cost and the impact of inventory shrink. Inventory
reserves are based on historical information and assumptions about future demand and inventory shrink trends. It is possible that changes
to inventory reserve estimates could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, the core principle of which
is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes
revenue for its performance obligation associated with its contracts with customers at a point in time once products are shipped. Amounts
collected from customers in advance of shipping products ordered are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The Company s standard terms are non-cancelable and do not provide for the right-of-return, other than for defective merchandise
covered under the Company s standard warranty. The Company has not historically experienced any significant returns or warranty
issues. 

46 

Business
Combinations 

Upon
acquisition of a company, we determine if the transaction is a business combination, which is accounted for using the acquisition method
of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, are
recorded at fair value. We use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. One of the most significant estimates relates to the determination of the fair value
of these assets and liabilities. The determination of the fair values is based on estimates and judgments made by management. Our estimates
of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Measurement
period adjustments are reflected at the time identified, up through the conclusion of the measurement period, which is the time at which
all information for determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and is not to exceed one year
from the acquisition date. We may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. 

Additionally,
uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the
acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions periodically and record any adjustments
to preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided we are within the measurement period. If outside of the measurement period, any subsequent
adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statement of operations. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for
inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities,
is as follows: 

Level
1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

 Level
2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 

 Level
3 Unobservable pricing inputs in the market 

Financial
assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may
affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amount
of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. The Company s derivative liabilities were
calculated using Level 2 assumptions. 

The
Company s contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of Gameface and PlaySight were calculated using Level 3 inputs. 

The
Company estimates the fair value of its intangible assets using Level 3 assumptions, primarily based on the income approach utilizing
the discounted cash flow method. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. 

47 

Long-Lived
Assets and Goodwill 

In
accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted
future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying
amount. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value, based on market value or discounted expected cash flows of those assets and is recorded in the period in
which the determination is made. Long-lived assets and goodwill related to Gameface in the amount of 11,421,817 were fully impaired
as of April 30, 2023, resulting in an impairment loss. 

The
Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). ASC 350 requires
that goodwill not be amortized, but reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. The Company records
goodwill as the excess purchase price over assets acquired and includes any work force acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for
impairment on an annual basis. 

With
the adoption of the ASU 2017-04, which eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test, the Company tests impairment of goodwill
in one step. In this step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value. The Company
determines the fair value of its reporting units with goodwill using a combination of a discounted cash flow and a market value approach.
If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company will
record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value. If the fair value of
the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company
will not record an impairment charge. 

Valuation
of Warrants 

The
Company grants warrants to key employees and executives as compensation on a discretionary basis. The Company also grants warrants in
connection with certain note payable agreements and other key arrangements. The Company is required to estimate the fair value of share-based
awards on the measurement date and recognize as expense that value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over
the requisite service period. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently
Adopted 

In
January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and
Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ASU 2017-04 ), which simplifies how an entity is required
to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, goodwill impairment will
be tested by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount
by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and
is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 effective
May 1, 2021. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

48 

In
December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU ), 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ,
which amends ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). This update is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain
exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application of ASC 740. This update
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance in this update has various elements, some of which are
applied on a prospective basis and others on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. 

The
adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own
Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible
debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being
separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation
models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition
of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued
with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives
scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06
will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on the Company s
consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASC 326 ). The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred
to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology
is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also
applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial
guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases.
ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as
the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company s portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for
available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down
on available-for-sale debt securities the Company does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required
to sell. The ASU can be adopted no later than January 1, 2020 for SEC filers and January 1, 2023 for private companies and smaller reporting
companies. The Company has not yet adopted this ASU as it qualifies as a smaller reporting company. The Company does not expect this
ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities (Topic
805) . The amendments in this Update address diversity and inconsistency related to the recognition and measurement of contract
assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer recognize
and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

49 

The
FASB has issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2021-04 provides
guidance that an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written
call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument.
The standard also provides guidance on how an entity should measure and recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.

Net
sales 

Our
net sales during the year ended April 30, 2023 were 9,922,799, compared to net sales of 16,102,672, in the same period to April 30,
2022, a reduction of -38 . Net sales consisted partially of shipped orders related to new orders placed and fulfilled to consumers via
our online marketplace and to our international distributors. The significant decrease in our online consumer marketing of Slinger Bag,
coupled with the general marketplace impact resulting from the increased consumer social mobility following the lifting of all covid
-related restrictions contributed to the significant decrease in sales. 

Cost
of sales 

Our
cost of sales during the year ended April 30, 2023 were 7,144,335, compared to 11,878,010 for the period to April 30, 2022, a reduction
of -40 . Cost of Sales represents the costs of units shipped during the period. This reduction in Cost of Sales is a direct result of
the reduction in net sales. This resulted in a gross profit of 2,778,464, or 28.00 . compared to a gross profit of 4,224,622, or 26.24 
for the period to April 30, 2022. The 4.28 in gross profit margin can be attributed to a combination of a reduction in transportation
costs from Asia, compared to the same period in 2022, coupled with a small increase in average selling price of the Slinger Bag units. 

Selling
and marketing expenses 

During
the year ended April 30, 2023, we incurred selling and marketing expenses of 1,928,198 compared with 3,477,570 during the year ended
April 30, 2022, a reduction of -45 . This decrease is largely driven by a decrease in social media advertising, sponsorships, and other investments in our
public relations presence based on lower cash flows being generated by lower sales. 

General and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, including share-based compensation, and other employee-related costs,
as well as legal fees and fees for professional services. During the year ended April 30, 2023, we incurred general and
administrative expenses of 22,743,877 compared with 46,718,986 during the year ended April 30, 2022, a reduction of -51 . The decrease in general and
administrative expenses is largely due to a reduction in our share based compensation that resulted in an expense of 31,727,091,
and our impairment loss on the intangible assets and goodwill of Gameface of 11,421,817 in the year ended April 30,
2023. 

Research
and development costs 

During
the year ended April 30, 2023, we incurred research and development costs of 65,164 compared with 736,141 during the year ended April
30, 2022. This decrease is mainly driven by our need to pause all development activity in the period due to limited cash flow being available
for investment. 

Other
expenses 

During
the year ended April 30, 2023, we recorded a gain on change in fair value of derivatives of 10,950,017, compared to 18,557,184 during
the year ended April 30, 2022. 0 gain on change in fair value of contingent consideration and 4,847,000 was recorded during the years
ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. Excluding the gains, during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, we had other expenses totaling 14,269,067
and 23,222,124, respectively. The decrease in other expenses for the year ended April 30, 2023 as compared to April 30, 2022 was primarily
due a reduction in amortization of discounts and losses incurred on extinguishment of our debt and convertible notes, a decrease in interest
expense from 2022 to 2023 due to changes in our long-term debt, offset by increases in derivative expense and interest to related parties. 

Discontinued
Operations 

Discontinued
operations incorporates the impact of the divestments of both PlaySight and Gameface during the period to April 30, 2023. Total loss
from discontinued operations was 45,875,860 during the year ended April 30, 2023 compared to 5,247,677 in the year ended April 30,
2022. 

51 

The
loss from discontinued operations was 4,461,968 during the period to April 30,2023 compared to 5,247,677 in the period to April 30,
2022. 

The
Company previously classified Foundation Sports in continuing operations, until December 5, 2022 when they sold 75 of Foundation Sports
back to the original owners at which time it deconsolidated this subsidiary and recorded a loss on the sale. The Company also determined
to dispose of the PlaySight entity during the year ended April 30, 2023. The Company completed the sale in November 2022 and recorded
a loss on the sale at that time. The total loss on disposal of Foundation Sports and PlaySight amounted to 41,413,892 in the year ended
April 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our
liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of 151,750,610 as of April 30,
2023, and more losses are anticipated in the development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able to obtain
the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due.
Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from related parties, and/or
private placement of debt and/or common stock. 

The
following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022:

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Connexa Sports Technologies Inc (the Company as of April
30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity and cash
flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of April 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of (151,750,610), net loss of (71,153,685) and a negative working capital of (18,775,991). These matters
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these
matters are also described in Note 2 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in
any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing
separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Complex Debt and Equity Transaction on disposal of
PlaySight. 

As disclosed in Note 16, on November 27, 2022, the
company disposed of one of its subsidiaries, and the Company entered into debt and/or equity transactions and agreements that contained
terms and provisions that were uncommon in practice. Due to the unusual nature of the agreements, ensuring the accounting for the transactions
was challenging, subjective, and required complex auditor judgment, including detailed analysis and interpretation of accounting standards. 

In order to audit these significant unusual transactions,
we reviewed the Company analysis and had to perform a significant amount of research in order to gain comfort in the accounting for each.

Accountants)

have served as the Company s auditor since 2023.

of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

For
further details on PlaySight and Foundation Sports we refer you to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022,
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 17, 2023. This Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements will concentrate
on our existing business as reflected in the following paragraph. 

The
Company operates in the sport equipment and technology business. The Company is the owner of the Slinger Launcher, which is a portable
tennis ball launcher as well as other associated tennis accessories and Gameface AI an Australian artificial intelligence sports software
company. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). As a result of the transactions described above, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the combined results of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger
Bag UK, SBL, and Gameface for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. The operations of Foundation Sports and PlaySight are included
as discontinued operations in our statements of operations as these entities were sold in November 2022 and December 2022 as disclosed
in Note 16. 

The
Company reports Gameface on a one-month calendar lag allowing for the timely preparation of financial statements. Gameface operates on
fiscal year end periods as of December 31. This one-month reporting lag is with the exception of significant transactions or events that
occur during the intervening period. The Company did not identify any significant transactions during the one month ended April 30, 2023
at Gameface that would need to be disclosed as not included within the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Impact
of COVID-19 Pandemic 

The
Company has been carefully monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on its business. In that regard, while the Company has continued
to sell its products and grow its business it did experience certain disruptions in its supply chains. The Company expects the significance
of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on the Company s financial and operational results, to be dictated
by, among other things, its duration, the success of efforts to contain it and the impact of actions taken in response. While the Company
has not experienced any material disruptions to its business and operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible such
disruptions may occur in the future which may impact its financial and operational results, and which could be material. 

Impact
of Russian and Ukrainian Conflict 

In
February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. We are closely monitoring
the unfolding events due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its regional and global ramifications. We have one distributor in Russia,
which is not material to our overall financial results. We do not have operations in Ukraine or Belarus. We are monitoring any broader
economic impact from the current crisis. The specific impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. However, to the extent that such military action spreads
to other countries, intensifies, or otherwise remains active, such action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows. 

as
of April 30, 2023, and more losses are anticipated in the development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able
to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
become due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from related
parties, and/or private placement of debt and/or common stock. In the event that the Company is unable to successfully raise capital
and/or generate revenues, the Company will likely reduce general and administrative expenses, and cease or delay its development plan
until it is able to obtain sufficient financing. The Company has begun reducing operating expenses and cash outflows by selling PlaySight,
as well as selling of Foundation Sports in November and December 2022, respectively to the former shareholders of those companies.
There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. We have recorded the
 investment in Foundation Sprots at . 

and in allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022.

Step
3: Determine the transaction price 

The
transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods
or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer includes predetermined fixed amounts, variable amounts,
or both. The Company s contracts do not include any rights of returns or refunds. 

The
Company collects each year s service fees in advance and should therefore consider the existence of a significant financing component.
However, due to the fact that the payments are provided for the service of a one-year term, the Company elected to apply the practical
expedient under ASC 606 which exempts the adjustment of the consideration for the existence of a significant financing component when
the period between the transfer of the services and the payment for such services is one year or less. 

Step
4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

Contracts
that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on
each performance obligation s relative standalone selling price SSP ). The Company has identified a single performance
obligation in the contract, and therefore, the allocation provisions under ASC 606 do not apply to the Company s contracts. 

Step
5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

Revenues
for the Company s single, combined performance obligation are recognized on a straight-line basis over the customer s contract
term, which is the period in which the parties to the contract have enforceable rights and obligations (Typically 3-4 years). 

Financial
assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may
affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.

In
August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging
Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own
Equity. ASU 2020-06 will simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models for convertible
debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. Limiting the accounting models results in fewer embedded conversion features being
separately recognized from the host contract as compared with current GAAP. Convertible instruments that continue to be subject to separation
models are (1) those with embedded conversion features that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, that meet the definition
of a derivative, and that do not qualify for a scope exception from derivative accounting and (2) convertible debt instruments issued
with substantial premiums for which the premiums are recorded as paid-in capital. ASU 2020-06 also amends the guidance for the derivatives
scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. ASU 2020-06
will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have on the Company s
consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments ASC 326 ). The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred
to as the current expected credit loss CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology
is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also
applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial
guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases.
ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as
the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company s portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for
available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down
on available-for-sale debt securities the Company does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required
to sell. The ASU can be adopted no later than January 1, 2020 for SEC filers and January 1, 2023 for private companies and smaller reporting
companies. The Company has not yet adopted this ASU as it qualifies as a smaller reporting company. The Company does not expect this
ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities (Topic
805) . The amendments in this Update address diversity and inconsistency related to the recognition and measurement of contract
assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The amendments in this Update require that an acquirer recognize
and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

The
FASB has issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2021-04 provides
guidance that an entity should treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written
call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument.
The standard also provides guidance on how an entity should measure and recognize the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption
of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

the Securities ). The Company received an aggregate of in gross proceeds from the Offering, before deducting
offering expenses and commissions. 

The
Convertible Notes were to mature on (the Maturity Date and bear interest at per annum payable on each
conversion date (as to that principal amount then being converted), on each redemption date as well as mandatory redemption date (as
to that principal amount then being redeemed) and on the Maturity Date, in cash. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of
the Company s common stock at any time following the date of issuance and prior to Mandatory Conversion (as defined in the Convertible
Notes) at the conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) , subject to adjustment set forth in the Convertible Notes and (ii) in
the case of an uplist to the NASDAQ, the Uplist Conversion Price (as defined in the Convertible Notes) of the Company s common
stock during the two Trading Day (as defined in the Convertible Notes) period after each conversion date; provided, however, that at
any time from and after December 31, 2021 or an Event of Default (as defined in the Convertible Notes), the holder of the Convertible
Notes may, by delivery of written notice to the Company, elect to cause all, or any part, of the Convertible Notes to be converted, at
any time thereafter, each an Alternate Conversion , pursuant to the Section 4(f) of the Convertible Notes, all, or any part

price. The Convertible Notes rank pari passu with all other notes now or thereafter issued under the terms set forth in the Convertible

contain certain price protection provisions providing for adjustment of the amount of securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrants
in case of certain future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends. 

The
Company evaluated the Warrants and the conversion options under the guidance in ASC 815 and determined they represent derivative liabilities
given the variability in the exercise and conversion prices upon the event of an up list to the NASDAQ. The Company also evaluated the
other embedded features in the agreement and determined the interest make-whole provision and the subsequent financing redemption represent
put features that are also accounted for as derivative liabilities. The derivative liabilities are marked to market at the end of each
reporting period with the non-cash gain or loss recorded in the period as a gain or loss on derivative (see Note 3). 

The
Warrants were valued at on the date of issuance using a Monte Carlo simulation that accounted for the variability in the
exercise price upon the event of an up list based on the Company s expected future stock prices over the five -year term using inputs
in line with those listed in Note 3. The remaining derivatives were valued at on the issuance date based on the present value
of their weighted average probability value.

determined the conversion option qualified for equity classification. The Company also evaluated the profit guarantee under ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging, and determined it to be a make-whole provision, which is an embedded derivative within the host instrument.

recorded in the period as a gain or loss on derivative.

Nasdaq
Compliance 

On
March 21, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that the Company s failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2023 Additional
Delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting the Company s securities from Nasdaq. The Company received a letter
from the Nasdaq on February 14, 2023, indicating that, due to the Company s failure, in violation of Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), to
file its (i) Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022; and (ii) Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q

Nasdaq at the opening of business on February 23, 2023. Nasdaq would also have filed a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ), which would have resulted in the removal of the Company s securities from listing and registration on
the Nasdaq (the Staff Determination ). Additionally, on October 10, 2022, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating
that the Company s common stock is subject to potential delisting from Nasdaq because, for a period of 30 consecutive business

Hearing scheduled for March 30, 2023, and a final determination regarding the Company s listing status. The Company is required
to address the Additional Delinquency, the Delinquent Filings, and the Corporate Governance Deficiencies before the Panel. Although the
Company is working diligently to file the Delinquent Filings and Additional Delinquency, there can be no assurance that they will be
filed prior to the Hearing. If the Company s appeal is denied or the Company fails to timely regain compliance with Nasdaq s
continued listing standards, the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting on the Nasdaq.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Security and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer),
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of April 30, 2023. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the year ended April 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 

55 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief
Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
 and 

provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
 with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material impact on the financial statements. 

Because
of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting
includes using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), an integrated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, for the evaluation of internal control to identify the risks and control objectives related
to the evaluation of our control environment. 

Based
on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of April 30, 2023 due to the following material weaknesses that were identified: 

The
 Company lacked adequate segregation of duties due to the small size of the organization. Further, the Company lacked an independent
 Board of Directors or Audit Committee to ensure adequate monitoring or oversight. 

The Company lacked a chief financial officer and personnel with experience and expertise in public company accounting
and internal control over financial reporting. 

The
 Company lacks accounting resources and controls to prevent or detect material misstatements. Specifically, the Company continues
 to have a material weakness in our controls over accounting for inventory due to a lack of controls over ensuring inventory movement
 was being processed accurately and in a timely manner, which resulted in significant audit adjustments relating to the value of our
 inventory and cost of sales. Further, while the Company engages service providers to assist with US GAAP compliance the Company lacks
 resources with adequate knowledge to oversee those services. Lastly, the Company does not have sufficient resources to complete timely
 reconciliations and transactional reviews, which resulted in delays in the financial reporting process. 

To
remediate the material weaknesses, we have initiated compensating controls in the near term and are enhancing and revising our existing
controls, including ensuring we have sufficient management review procedures and adequate segregation of duties. The material weaknesses
will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded
they are operating effectively. 

This
Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Our management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Annual
Report.

COMMITTEES
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

Audit
Committee 

Management
has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The
Audit Committee reviews the Company s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board and administers our engagement of the
independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with
and without management present, to discuss the results of its examinations, the evaluations of our internal controls, and the overall
quality of our financial reporting. Kirk P. Taylor, Stephen Crummey and Rodney Rapson who each satisfies the independence 
requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq s rules, serve on our audit committee. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

We
have determined that Kirk Taylor is qualified as an Audit Committee Financial Expert, as that term is defined under the rules of the
SEC and in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

Compensation
Committee 

The
function of the Compensation Committee is to determine the compensation of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee has the
power to set performance targets for determining periodic bonuses payable to executive officers and may review and make recommendations
with respect to shareholder proposals related to compensation matters. Additionally, the Compensation Committee is responsible for administering
the 2020 Global Incentive Plan. Rodney Rapson is the sole independent director on the compensation committee. 

Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee 

The
responsibilities of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include the identification of individuals qualified to become Board
members, the selection of nominees to stand for election as directors, the oversight of the selection and composition of committees of
the Board, establishing procedures for the nomination process including procedures, oversight of possible conflicts of interests involving
the Board and its members, developing corporate governance principles, and the oversight of the evaluations of the Board and management.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not established a policy with regard to the consideration of any candidates recommended
by shareholders. If we receive any shareholder recommended nominations, the Corporate Governance Committee will carefully review the
recommendation(s) and consider such recommendation(s) in good faith. Kirk
Taylor and Rodney Rapson who satisfy the independence requirements of Nasdaq s rules, serve on our compensation committee
upon their appointment to the board, with Mr. Rapson serving as the chairman. 

Board
and Committee Meetings in the 2023 Fiscal Year 

In
the 2023 fiscal year, the Board acted by written consent in lieu of having any meetings and there were no committee meetings insofar
as the committees were not established until July 2023, which was after the 2023 fiscal year had ended. 

Board
Diversity 

While
we do not have a formal policy on diversity, our Board considers diversity to include the skill set, background, reputation, type and
length of business experience of our Board members as well as a particular nominee s contributions to that mix. Our Board believes
that diversity brings a variety of ideas, judgments and considerations that benefit the Company and its shareholders. Although there
are many other factors, the Board seeks individuals with experience on public company boards or the investment community, experience
on operating growing businesses, and experience with online universities. 

Section 16(a)
Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than 10 of our common stock to file initial
reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities with the SEC. These individuals are required
by the regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Due to administrative error, the required
forms were filed prior to the date hereof, but not prior to the deadline for such forms due to an administrative error. 

DIRECTOR
COMPENSATION 

Each
non-employee director will receive 150,000 shares of common stock on the anniversary date each non-employee director was appointed to the Board. In the event, a director should resign from the Board
mid-year, such director would receive a pro rata issuance of common stock at their anniversary date based on the number of days of
service since their prior anniversary date. No fractional shares will be issued to non-employee director, and any calculation
resulting in a fractional share will be rounded up to the next whole share. Mssrs. Goldman and Krishnan did not receive any compensation for or in respect of the period during which they served
as directors of the Company.

The
following table sets forth certain information, as of September 14, 2023, with respect to any person (including any group , as
that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) who is known
to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5 of any class of our voting securities, and as to those shares of our
equity securities beneficially owned by each of our directors and executive officers and all of our directors and executive officers
as a group. Unless otherwise specified in the table below, such information, other than information with respect to our directors and
executive officers, is based on a review of statements filed with the Securities and Exchange commission (the Commission pursuant to Sections 13 (d), 13 (f), and 13 (g) of the Exchange Act with respect to our common stock. 

The
number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each person is determined under the rules of the Commission and the information
is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares
as to which such person has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares which the individual has the right to
acquire within sixty (60) days after the date hereof, through the exercise of any stock option, warrant or other right. Unless otherwise
indicated, each person has sole investment and voting power (or shares such power with his or her spouse) with respect to the shares
set forth in the following table. The inclusion herein of any shares deemed beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial
ownership of those shares. 

The
following table lists, as at the date hereof, the number of shares of common stock of our Company that are beneficially owned by (i)
each person or entity known to our Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each officer

a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment
power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any
security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission

owner of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole
voting and investment power.

Securities
authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.

On
November 11, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Slinger Bag Inc. Global Share Incentive Plan (2020), or the 2020
Plan, which was approved by stockholders holding in the aggregate 19,994,700 shares of the Company s common stock, or approximately
75.4 of the Company s common stock outstanding on such date. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of awards which are incentive
stock options ISOs ), non-qualified stock options NQSOs ), unrestricted stock, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance stock and other equity-based and cash awards or any combination of the foregoing, to eligible key management
employees, non-employee directors, and non-employee consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each a participant (however, solely employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible for incentive stock option awards). 

The
Company has reserved a total of 15,000,000 shares for issuance under awards to be made under the 2020 Plan, all of which may, but need
not, be issued in connection with ISOs. To the extent that an award lapses, expires, is canceled, is terminated unexercised or ceases
to be exercisable for any reason, or the rights of its holder terminate, any shares subject to such award shall again be available for
the grant of a new award. The 2020 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the
date on which it was adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors in its
discretion may terminate the 2020 Plan at any time with respect to any shares for which awards have not theretofore been granted; provided,
however, that the 2020 Plan s termination shall not materially and adversely impair the rights of a holder, without the consent
of the holder, with respect to any award previously granted. 

66 

Future
new hires, non-employee directors and additional non-employee consultants are eligible to participate in the 2020 Plan as well. The number
of awards to be granted to officers, non-employee directors, employees and non-employee consultants cannot be determined at this time
as the grant of awards is dependent upon various factors such as hiring requirements and job performance.
