 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Chase General Corporation was incorporated November 6, 1944 for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. In 1970, Chase General Corporation acquired a 100 interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. Chase General Corporation and Dye Candy Company are sometimes referred herein as the Company. This subsidiary is the main operating company for the reporting entity. Principal Products and Methods of Distribution The subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash . The Seasonal Candy Products involve the production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment for inclusion in this filing. The principal products produced are as follows: Chase Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces a candy bar under the trade name of Cherry Mash . The bar is distributed in the following case sizes: (1) 60 count pack (2) 12 boxes of 24 bars per box (3) 200 count shipper box (4) 100 count shipper box (5) 100 # 2 box Counter Display In addition to the regular size bar, a mini-mash is distributed in the following case sizes: (1) 24 - 12 oz. bags (2) 3 jars - 60 bars per jar (3) 23 # wrapped bars (4) 22 # unwrapped bars (5) 12 - 12 oz. bags (6) 3 - 4 # jars (7) 24 - 12 oz. clamshell containers (8) 9 - 8 oz. clamshell containers

 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 ITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED) Principal Products and Methods of Distribution (Continued) Seasonal Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries and purchases other outsourced products. These products are distributed in bulk or packaged. Principal products include: 

(1) Coconut Bon-Bons (6) Peanut Brittle (2) Coconut Stacks (7) Peanut Clusters (3) Home Style Poe Fudge (8) Champion Cr me Drops (4) Peco Flake (9) Jelly Candies (5) Peanut Squares (10) Frosted Pretzels The Champion Cr me Drops, Frosted Pretzels, and Jelly Candies are not produced by the Company. All products are shipped to customers by commercial haulers. Competition and Market Area The Chase Candy Products division bars are sold primarily to wholesale candy, grocery accounts, vendors, and repackers. Cherry Mash bars are marketed in the Midwest region of the United States. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, this division accounted for 57 and 60 , respectively, of the sales of Dye Candy Company. The Seasonal Candy Products division is sold primarily on a Midwest regional basis to national syndicate accounts, repackers and grocery accounts. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, this division accounted for 43 and 40 , respectively of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company. The Company has no government contracts, foreign operations or export sales. In addition, all domestic sales are primarily in the Midwest region of the United States. The Company is a seasonal business whereby the largest volume of sales occur in August through December of each year. The earnings per quarter of the Company varies in direct proportion to the seasonal sales volume. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, there is a heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months of the year when the Company is building its inventories in anticipation of August through December sales. The fluctuation of demand on working capital due to the seasonal nature of the business is common to the confectionery industry. If necessary, the Company has the ability to borrow short-term funds to finance operations prior to receiving cash collections from fall sales. The Company occasionally offers extended payment terms of up to sixty days. Since this practice is infrequent, the effect on working capital is minimal. Prompt service and efficient service are traits demanded in the confectionery industry, which results in a continual low volume of back-orders. Therefore, at no time during the year does the Company have a significant amount of back-orders.

 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 ITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED) Competition and Market Area (Continued) Chase Candy Company seasonal products are sold in both the grocery and produce departments with bulk, prepackaged clamshell and shippers. Chase Candy Company offers a variety of quality products at a value price. The competitive set of the business does not have a national brand competitor but mostly regional competition and private label. The primary competition includes: 1. Palmer Candy Company sells products that mostly mirror Chase Candy products but they market their products through the bakery department. Retail pricing on Palmer products is usually higher than Chase products. 2. Zachary Confections is another regional competitor that sells many similar items as Chase Candy and are also priced at retail similar to Chase. 3. The low price competitor is Private Label and depending on location, they have products that are of the same variety as Chase Candy products. Product quality is usually not at the same level as Chase products. 
 Principal methods of competition the Company uses include quality of product, price, reduced transportation costs due to central location, and service. The Company s competitive position is positively influenced by labor costs being lower than industry average. Chase General Corporation is firmly established in the confectionery market and through its operating divisions has many years of experience associated with its name. Research and Development The Company has not developed any new products for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers Raw materials and packaging materials are produced on a national basis with products coming from locations throughout the United States. Raw materials and packaging materials are generally widely available, depending on common market influences. Two suppliers accounted for more than 25 of the Company s cost of sales for the year ended June 30, 2023 and one supplier accounted for more than 12 of the Company s costs of sales for the year ended June 30, 2022. Patents and Trademarks The largest single revenue producing product, the Cherry Mash bar, is protected by a trademark registered with The United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company considers this trademark significant to operations. This trademark expires in the year 2029. Employees As of June 30, 2023, the Company had 17 full-time employees. This expands to approximately 30 full-time personnel during the busy production months of August through December.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, that same customer accounted for 47 and 21 , respectively, of trade receivables. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, another customer and its affiliates accounted for 6 and 3 , respectively, of sales. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, that same customer and its affiliates accounted for 12 and 13 , respectively, of trade receivables.

No other customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company s sales for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. No other customers accounted for more than 10 of the Company s trade receivables for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 . Environmental Protection and the Effect on Probable Government Regulations on the Business To the best of management s knowledge, the Company is presently in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations and does not anticipate any future expenditures in this regard. The Company has evaluated the requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The FSMA aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus of federal regulators from responding to contamination to preventing it. The FSMA has given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new authorities to regulate the way foods are grown, harvested, and processed. As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and through the filing of this form, management believes the Company is compliant with all FSMA requirements. Another inspection for compliance will be conducted by a third party within 12 months of year-end. Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the next twelve months in this regard. Need for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services The Company is required to meet the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for proper labeling of its products and for contents of its products. Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the next twelve months in this regard. Reports to Security Holders The Registrant is not required to send the annual audit report, annual 10-K report and quarterly 10-Q reports to security holders since the stock is not actively traded. These reports are available at the Registrant s registered office or they are available online on the SEC s EDGAR website. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Not applicable to a smaller reporting company.

 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Overview During fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Company s sales were 3,446,234, as compared to sales of 3,064,443 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The 12.5 increase in volume coupled with various price increases, 7.4 increase in cost of sales and 3.7 increase in operating expenses resulted in a change in profitability during the year, as reflected in the income from operations of 163,363 for fiscal year 2023 compared to the loss from operations of 22,264 for fiscal year 2022. Working capital increased 120,935 to 682,537 for the fiscal year 2023 from 561,602 for the fiscal year 2022 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable. The following information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates General Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenues as product is shipped to customers. Sales are comprised of the total sales billed during the period, including shipping and handling charges to the customer, less the estimated returns, customer allowances, customer discounts, billbacks and advertising. Inventories Raw material and packaging material inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out basis of accounting. The cost of goods in process include an estimate for manufacturing overhead. Finished goods inventory are valued using the lower of cost or market value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of finished goods inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.

 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the years indicated, the percentage of sales of certain items in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively: 

For the Years Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Sales 100 100 Cost of Sales 69 72 Gross Profit on Sales 31 28 Operating Expenses 27 29 Income (Loss) from Operations 4 (1) Other Income, Net Net Income (Loss) before Income Taxes 4 (1) Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Net Income (Loss) 4 (1) Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022 Sales During the year ended June 30, 2023, sales, net of returns and allowances, increased 381,791 or 12.5 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Sales for Chase Candy products increased 107,431 or 5.8 to 1,956,658 for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 1,849,227 for the year ended June 30, 2022. Sales for Seasonal Candy products increased 274,360 or 22.6 to 1,489,576 for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to 1,215,216 for the year ended June 30, 2022.

The 5.8 increase in sales of Chase Candy of 107,431 for the year ended June 30, 2023 over the same period ended June 30, 2022, is primarily due to the following: 1) price increases that took effect in December 2022 for the majority of customers 2) increased sales of the L278/L212 Mini Mash division by approximately 150,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 3) increased sales of the L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash division by approximately 5,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, offset by 4) decreased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division by approximately 34,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in orders from existing customers, 5) decreased sales of the Cherry Mash internet sales via the Company s website by approximately 4,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in orders from existing customers and 6) decreased sales of Cherry Mash Merchandisers division by approximately 7,500 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to a decrease in orders from existing customers.

 CHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year 2022 (Continued) Sales (Continued) Sales for Seasonal Candy consisted of the following divisions: bulk seasonal division, clamshell seasonal division, and the generic seasonal division. The 22.6 increase in sales of Seasonal Candy of 274,360 for the year ended June 30, 2023 over the same period ended June 30, 2022, is primarily due to a price increase in July 2022 which resulted in strong first and second quarter sales to existing customers offset by a relatively flat period of sales in the third and fourth quarters. Specifically by division, the following changes were noted 1) increased sales in the Chase clamshell seasonal division by approximately 150,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased orders from existing customers, 2) increased sales in the generic seasonal division by approximately 75,000 due to increased orders from existing customers and 3) increased sales in the bulk seasonal division by approximately 50,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased orders from existing customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, increased by 7.4 . The cost of sales increased 163,148 to 2,361,913 while decreasing to 68.5 of sales for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 2,198,765 or 71.8 of sales for the year ended June 30, 2022. The 7.4 increase in cost of sales of 163,148 is related to increases in raw materials, labor and freight costs. Due to volatility in the regions where raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Labor costs, including wages, vacation pay and payroll taxes of 797,152 for the year ended June 30, 2023, increased 4.8 or 39,860 as compared to 757,292 for the year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to increased production wages due to increased hours, bonuses, and pay rates compared to the same period ended June 30, 2022. All employees were given a 5-10 raise at the end of January 2023. Freight expense, including shipping and handling costs on goods shipped of 168,442 for the year ended June 30, 2023, increased 25.1 or 33,822 as compared to 134,620 for the year ended June 30, 2022 due primarily to inflationary impacts such as costs of fuel coupled with increase in quantities ordered.

Selling Expenses Selling expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased 21,742 to 343,734, which is 10 of sales, compared to 321,992 or 10.5 of sales for the year June 30, 2022. This increase is primarily due to increases in commissions as a result of increase in sales and increases in depreciation expense due to purchase of new vehicles. Commission expense increased 13,320 to 144,788 for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 131,468 for the year ended June 30, 2022. Depreciation expense increased 9,863 to 29,035 for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 19,172 for the year ended June 30, 2022.

At June 30, 2023, the Company s accumulated deficit was 5,569,568, compared to an accumulated deficit of 5,726,735 as of June 30, 2022. Working capital as of June 30, 2023 increased 120,935 to 682,537 from 561,602 as of June 30, 2022. The Company s lease on its office and plant facility is effective through March 31, 2025, with an option to extend for an additional term of five years. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company determined the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured and has therefore remeasured the right-of-use asset and lease liability to include the additional five years at the current rate so that the new term expires on March 31, 2030. The lease currently requires payments of 6,500 per month. The Company does not believe the payments in the renewal period will vary significantly from this current amount. The facility is leased from an entity that is owned by the son of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In order to maintain funds to finance operations and meet debt obligations, it is the intention of management to continue its efforts to expand the present market area and increase sales to its customers. Management also intends to continue tight control on all expenditures. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Management intends to make sales price adjustments in the future to correspond with changes in raw material prices. Management believes that the projected cash flow from operations combined with the availability on the line of credit will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. .

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Chase General Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chase General Corporation and its subsidiary (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The lease currently requires payments of per month, as noted the Company does not believe the payments in the renewal period will vary significantly from this current amount.

Additionally, any other short-term leases are immaterial. The Company elected the to not separate lease and nonlease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify.

 ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s principal executive officer, who is also the chief financial and accounting officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, such officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including those officers, and to members of the board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rue 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Management, under the supervision of the Company s principal executive, who is also the chief financial and accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023 under the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework.

 ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (CONTINUED) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Continued) A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that material weaknesses exist due to the following reasons: The Company has an ineffective control environment due to the lack of the necessary corporate accounting resources with SEC financial reporting experience to ensure consistent, complete and accurate financial reporting, as well as disclosure controls and procedures. The Company has outsourced the financial reporting function to a qualified accounting firm; however, the Company does not have the internal resources to maintain appropriate disclosure controls and procedures. The Company has limited resources to ensure that necessary internal controls are implemented and followed throughout the Company. The limited resources result in a lack of adequate segregation of duties relating to the authorization, recognition, capture, and review of transactions, facts, circumstances and events that could have a material impact on the Company s financial reporting process. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Controls There were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that in management s estimates are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal controls over financial reporting subsequent to the date of the evaluation.
