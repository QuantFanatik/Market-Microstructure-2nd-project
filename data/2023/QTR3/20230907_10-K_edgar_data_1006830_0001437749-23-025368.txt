 General 
 
 Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (Corporation) is a bank holding company as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA), and is a registered bank holding company under that act and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1994. In February 1995, the Corporation acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Consumers National Bank (Bank), a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America. The Corporation s activities have been limited primarily to holding the common stock of the Bank. 
 
 Consumers National Bank is a community-oriented financial institution that offers a wide range of commercial and consumer loan and deposit products, as well as mortgage, financial planning and investment services to individuals, farmers and small and medium sized businesses in our markets. Since 1965, the Bank s main office has been serving Minerva, Ohio, and surrounding areas from its location at 614 East Lincoln Way, Minerva, Ohio. The Bank seeks to be the provider of choice for financial solutions to customers who value exceptional personalized service, local decision making, and modern banking technology. The Bank s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, Summit and Wayne counties in Ohio. Its market includes these counties as well as the contiguous counties in northeast Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank had 21 full-service branch locations and one loan production office. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities, municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. 
 
 On July 16, 2021, the Corporation completed its acquisition (branch acquisition) of two branches located in Calcutta and Wellsville, Ohio from CFBank, National Association. In connection with the branch acquisition, the Corporation assumed 104,538 in branch deposits for a deposit premium of 1.75 . In addition, the Corporation acquired 15,602 of subordinated debt securities issued by unrelated financial institutions, 19,943 of loans, and recorded goodwill of 1,616. This transaction qualified as a business combination. 
 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 
 The Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and other federal and state regulators. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Earnings and dividends of the Corporation are affected by state and federal laws and regulations and by policies of various regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could affect materially the business and prospects of the Corporation and the Bank. The following describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that have, or could have, a material impact on the Corporation. The following discussion of supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. 
 
 Regulation of the Corporation 
 
 The Bank Holding Company Act: As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to regulation under the BHCA, and the examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. Under the BHCA, the Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require. 
 
 The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries and engaging in any other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to those activities. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares of a bank or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 

3

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 
 Privacy Provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 contains extensive provisions on a customer s right to privacy of non-public personal information. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide its customers with the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers non-public personal information. Except in certain cases, an institution may not provide personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses that such information may be disclosed, and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. The Corporation and the Bank are also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of non-public personal information. 
 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains important requirements for public companies in the areas of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, written certifications by the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required. These certifications attest that the Corporation s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact. 
 
 Regulation of the Bank 
 
 As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). These examinations are designed primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank. 
 
 Dividend Restrictions: Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to the Corporation s shareholders. There are statutory limits, however, on the amount of dividends the Bank can pay without regulatory approval. Under regulations promulgated by the OCC, the Bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its undivided profits. Additionally, the Bank may not declare a dividend if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its retained net income of that year to date, combined with its retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the dividend is approved by the OCC. The Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be undercapitalized, as defined in the federal regulations. 
 
 FDIC: The FDIC is an independent federal agency, which insures the deposits of federally insured banks and savings associations up to certain prescribed limits and safeguards the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The deposits of the Bank are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDIC s deposit insurance assessment system, the assessment rate for any insured institution varies according to regulatory capital levels of the institution and other factors such as supervisory evaluations. 
 
 The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that poses a serious threat to the insurance fund and may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may also terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 
 Current Expected Credit Loss Model: In December 2018, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC issued a final rule to address regulatory treatment of credit loss allowances under the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The rule revised the federal banking agencies regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over three years the day one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model. The Bank adopted the CECL model on July 1, 2023 since it s a smaller reporting company and expects to elect to phase in the day-one effect of adopting CECL for regulatory capital purposes. 
 
 Risk-Based Capital Requirements: The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC employ similar risk-based capital guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and national banks, respectively. The Corporation meets the definition of a Small Bank Holding Company and, therefore, was exempt from maintaining consolidated regulatory capital ratios. Instead, regulatory capital ratios only apply at the subsidiary bank level. The guidelines involve a process of assigning various risk weights to different classes of assets, then evaluating the sum of the risk-weighted balance sheet structure against the capital base. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by the guidelines, the bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. In addition, failure to satisfy capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement actions by federal bank regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and a prohibition on the acceptance of brokered deposits.

Effective January 1, 2020, qualifying community banking organizations may elect to comply with a greater than 9 community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) requirement in lieu of the currently applicable requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. The CBLR is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets. In order to qualify for the CBLR election, a community bank must (i) have a leverage capital ratio greater than 9 percent, (ii) have less than 10 billion in average total consolidated assets, (iii) not exceed certain levels of off-balance sheet exposure and trading assets plus trading liabilities and (iv) not be an advanced approaches banking organization. A community bank that meets the above qualifications and elects to utilize the CBLR is considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rules and is also considered to be "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action rules. The Bank has not elected to be subject to the CBLR. 
 
 Unless a community bank qualifies for, and elects to comply with the CBLR beginning on January 1, 2020, national banks are required to maintain the Basel III minimum levels of regulatory capital. The Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations became effective on January 1, 2015 and were fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Under Basel III, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 , a total capital ratio of 8 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . Basel III also established a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which effectively resulted in a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 , a total capital ratio of 10.5 and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.5 . The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a common equity Tier 1 ratio to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 
 The OCC and the FDIC may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the OCC or the FDIC. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers. The OCC s final supervisory judgment concerning an institution s capital adequacy could differ significantly from the conclusions that might be derived from the absolute level of an institution s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, institutions generally are expected to maintain risk-based capital ratios that exceed the minimum ratios. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized. 
 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices and seeks to ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. Since it was established the CFPB has exercised extensive rulemaking and interpretive authority. 
 
 Interstate Banking and Branching: The Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1995 has eased restrictions on interstate expansion and consolidation of banking operations by, among other things: (i) permitting interstate bank acquisitions regardless of host state laws, (ii) permitting interstate merger of banks unless specific states have opted out of this provision, and (iii) permitting banks to establish new branches outside the state provided the law of the host state specifically allows interstate bank branching. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act: The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this Act, each institution is required to adopt a statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution s efforts to assist in its community s credit needs. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance and assigned ratings. Banking regulators consider these ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction by an institution. The Bank s most recent CRA rating is satisfactory. 
 
 USA PATRIOT Act: In 2001, Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act). The Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates that financial services companies implement additional policies and procedures with respect to additional measures designed to address any or all the following matters: money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, and currency crimes. 

5

The Anit-Money Laundering Act : In 2021, Congress enacted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement-related and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower initiatives and protections. 
 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation : The U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including applicable bank regulatory authorities not approving merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or prohibiting such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 
 
 Cybersecurity: In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. 
 
 In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. In addition, in July 2023, the SEC adopted rules that require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, processes, if any, for assessing, identifying and managing material cybersecurity risk as well as whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Corporation. 
 
 In November 2021, the OCC, the FRB and the FDIC issued a final rule, which became effective in May 2022, requiring banking organizations that experience a computer-security incident to notify certain entities. A computer-security incident occurs when actual or potential harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information occurs, or there is a violation or imminent threat of a violation to banking security policies and procedures. The affected bank must notify its respective federal regulator of the computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the bank determines a computer-security incident that rises to the level of a notification event has occurred. These notifications are intended to promote early awareness of threats to banking organizations and will help banks react to those threats before they manifest into larger incidents. This rule also requires bank service providers to notify their bank organization customers of a computer-security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption or degradation. 
 
 Furthermore, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, enacted in March 2022, will require, once administrative rules are adopted, certain covered entities, including those in the financial services industry, to report a covered cyber incident to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours after it reasonably believes an incident has occurred. Separate reporting to CISA will also be required within 24 hours if a ransom payment is made as a result of a ransomware attack. 
 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity in those areas to continue and we are monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, electronic communications and information systems are relied upon to conduct operations, to deliver services to customers and to store sensitive data. The Corporation employs a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, increasing volume of attacks, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Corporation and its customers. 

6

Government Monetary Policy: The earnings of the Corporation are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market acquisitions or dispositions of United States Government securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings and setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the interest income and interest expense of commercial banks, including the Bank, and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 
 
 Executive and Incentive Compensation: Under the Dodd-Frank Act and rules adopted by the SEC in October 2022, public companies will be required, once stock exchanges adopt additional listing requirements, to adopt and implement clawback policies for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures for recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. Such clawback policies are intended to apply to compensation paid within the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date the issuer is required to prepare a restatement and would cover all executives (including former executives) who received incentive awards. 
 
 Employees 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, the Bank employed 173 full-time and 21 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. Management considers its relations with employees to be good. 
 
 Available Information 
 
 The Corporation files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.

Management does not have knowledge of the prices paid in all transactions and has not verified the accuracy of those prices that have been reported. Because of the lack of an established market for the Corporation s common shares, these prices may not reflect the prices at which the common shares would trade in an active market. 
 
 The Corporation s management is currently committed to continuing to pay regular cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent on the Corporation s future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. The Corporation s principal source of funds for dividend payment is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. See Note 1 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for dividend restrictions. 
 
 There were no repurchases of the Corporation s securities during fiscal year 2023.

Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 
 General 
 
 The following is management s analysis of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial position than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are not statements of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words may, continue, estimate, intend, plan, seek, will, believe, project, expect, anticipate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond our control, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. Any such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report or the respective dates of the relevant incorporated documents, as the case may be, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected include, but are not limited to: 

changes in local, regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than we expect, resulting in a deterioration in asset credit quality or debtors being unable to meet their obligations because of high unemployment rates and inflationary pressures; 

rapid fluctuations in market interest rates could result in changes in fair market valuations and a decline in net interest income; 

changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs; 

unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including, but not limited to, changes in the cost of liquidity and our ability to find alternative funding sources; 

the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance) with which we must comply; 

the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 

breaches of security or failures of our technology systems due to technological or other factors and cybersecurity threats; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

declining asset values impacting the underlying value of collateral; 

changes in accounting policies, rules and interpretations; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; 

competitive pressures on product pricing and services; and 

changes in the reliability of our vendors, internal control systems or information systems. 

The risks and uncertainties identified above are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect us. Should any known or unknown risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, those developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 
 
 Net Income. Net income was 10,674 for fiscal year 2023 compared with 11,192 for fiscal year 2022. The following key factors summarize our results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared with the same prior year period: 

net interest income increased by 969, or 3.0 , in fiscal year 2023, primarily because of a 51,065, or 5.6 , increase in average interest-earning assets; 

a 855 provision for loan loss expense was recorded during fiscal year 2023 compared with 735 during fiscal year 2022; and 

total other expenses increased by 1,470, or 6.3 , in fiscal year 2023 due to increases in salaries and employee benefits; occupancy and equipment expenses; and professional and director fees. 

Return on average equity and return on average assets were 20.27 and 1.05 , respectively, for fiscal year 2023 compared with 16.43 and 1.17 , respectively, for the same period last year. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Corporation s earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies, and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, can significantly affect net interest income. 
 
 Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 . All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances and average securities include unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, while yields are based on average amortized cost.

FTE net interest income for fiscal year 2023 was 33,919, an increase of 660 or 2.0 , from 33,259 in fiscal year 2022. The Corporation s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.37 for fiscal year 2023 and 3.60 for fiscal year 2022. FTE interest income for fiscal year 2023 was 41,143, an increase of 6,470, or 18.70 , from fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a 51,065, or 5.6 , increase in average interest-earning assets from fiscal year 2022. The growth in average interest-earning assets was primarily a result of a 65,313, or 10.9 , increase in average loans. In fiscal year 2022, interest income was positively impacted by 2,612 in interest and fee income that was recognized on Paycheck Protection Program loans. The Corporation s yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.09 for the 2023 fiscal year compared with 3.75 for the same period last year. 
 
 Interest expense for fiscal year 2023 was 7,224, an increase of 5,810 from fiscal year 2022 primarily because of the rapid increase in current market interest rates and the increased competition for deposits. The Corporation s average cost of funds was 1.03 for fiscal year 2023 compared with 0.22 for the same prior year period.

(1) 
 Nontaxable income is adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis utilizing a statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 . 

(2) 
 Non-accrual loan balances are included for purposes of computing the rate and volume effects although interest on these balances has been excluded. 

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses represents the charge to income necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that represents management s assessment of the estimated probable credit losses in the Corporation s loan portfolio that have been incurred at each balance sheet date. The amount of the provision is affected by loan charge-offs, recoveries and changes in specific and general allocations required for the allowance for loan losses. Management considers a number of factors that impact the provision for loan losses, such as historical loss experience, the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers, the current conditions within the markets where the Corporation originates loans, the status of nonperforming assets, the estimated underlying value of the collateral and other factors related to the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio. 
 
 A provision for loan loss expense of 855 was recorded in fiscal year 2023 compared with 735 in fiscal year 2022. The loan loss provision expense recorded in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the organic growth within the loan portfolio. For fiscal year 2023, net charge offs of 291, or 0.04 of total loans, were recorded compared with 46, or 0.01 of total loans, for the same period last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 1.09 at June 30, 2023 and 1.17 at June 30, 2022. The decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was due to the improvement in economic conditions as the economy has remained resilient following the pandemic and through the rapid rise in short-term interest rates. Also, substandard and non-accrual loans are at very low levels. 
 
 Non-performing loans were 104, or 0.01 of total loans, as of June 30, 2023. This compared with 440, or 0.07 of total loans, as of June 30, 2022. Non-performing loans declined primarily because two loans that had a balance of 382 as of June 30, 2022 were returned to accrual status during fiscal year 2023. Non-performing loans have been considered in management s analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Management and the Board of Directors closely monitor these loans and believe the prospect for recovery of principal, less identified specific reserves, are favorable. 
 
 Other Income. Total other income increased by 12, or 0.3 , to 4,747 for fiscal year 2023. Service charges on deposit accounts increased by 138, or 9.5 , in fiscal year 2023 primarily as a result of increases in personal and business service charges on demand deposit accounts. Debit card interchange income increased by 112, or 5.4 in fiscal year 2023 because of increased debit card usage and an increase in the number of cards issued. These increases were partially offset by mortgage banking activity income decreasing by 287 in fiscal year 2023 because of the increase in mortgage rates impacting refinancing and new home sales volume. 

13

Other Expenses. Total other expenses were 24,685 for the year ended June 30, 2023; an increase of 1,470, or 6.3 , from 23,215 for the year ended June 30, 2022. 
 
 Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by 760, or 5.7 , during fiscal year 2023 primarily due to merit and cost of living increases and lower deferred loan costs. These increases were partially offset by lower salary continuation plan expenses because of an increase in the discount rate and lower incentive expenses. 
 
 Professional and director fees increased by 187, or 21.3 , during fiscal year 2023 from the same period last year primarily because of an increase in director fees and consulting expenses. Director fees increased mainly due to the issuance of restricted stock awards and units in fiscal year 2023 as the Corporation started issuing restricted stock units in fiscal year 2023 to better align the expense recognition with the performance criteria. In addition, consulting fees were higher in fiscal year 2023 as the Corporation prepared for the additional documentation and audit requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 since the Corporation now has over 1 billion in total assets and as it prepared for the adoption of the current expected credit loss model accounting standard. 
 
 Financial institutions tax expenses decreased by 64, or 11.8 , in fiscal year 2023 since this is a capital-based tax and total capital was lower as of the measurement date in fiscal year 2023 because of the accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 
 Other expenses increased by 256, or 12.7 , because of increases primarily in insurance, postage, and loan expenses as a result of the growth in the organization. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense totaled 2,248 and 2,339 and the effective tax rates were 17.4 and 17.3 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Income tax expense was calculated utilizing a statutory federal income tax rate of 21.0 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate as a result of tax-exempt income from obligations of states and political subdivisions, loans and bank owned life insurance earnings. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 
 Total assets as of June 30, 2023 were 1,060,024 compared with 977,313 at June 30, 2022, an increase of 82,711, or 8.5 . The growth in total assets is mainly attributable to an increase of 98,519, or 16.1 , in total loans and was primarily funded by a 65,971, or 7.4 , increase in total deposits. 
 
 Securities. Total securities were 286,575 at June 30, 2023, of which 279,605 were classified as available-for-sale and 6,970 were classified as held-to-maturity. The securities portfolio is mainly comprised of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, state and political subdivisions and government-sponsored enterprises. The following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2023 and 2022 and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss:

The weighted average interest rates are based on coupon rates for securities purchased at par value and on effective yields considering amortization or accretion if the securities were purchased at a premium or discount. The weighted average yield on tax-exempt obligations has been calculated on a tax equivalent basis. Average yields are based on amortized cost balances. 
 
 Loans. Loan receivables increased by 98,519, or 16.1 , to 710,362 at June 30, 2023 compared to 611,843 at June 30, 2022. Commercial loans increased by 25,547, or 29.3 , primarily because of a third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit that had a balance of 10,000 as of June 30, 2023 and had a zero balance as of June 30, 2022. Consumer loans increased by 20,588, or 45.9 , primarily as a result of the expansion of indirect auto lending and an increase in direct auto loans due to successful marketing campaigns.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses balance and the provision charged to expense are judgmentally determined by management based upon a periodic review of the loan portfolio for valuation purposes and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management establishes allowances for estimated losses on loans based upon its evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the types and quality of loans; historical loss experience based on volume and types of loans; trend in portfolio volume and composition; level and trend of nonperforming assets; detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured; determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing such loans and the current economic conditions affecting the collectability of loans in the portfolio. 
 
 Failure to receive principal and interest payments when due on any loan results in efforts to restore such loan to a current status. Loans are classified as non-accrual when, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal and accrued interest is not expected. The loans must be brought and kept current for six sustained payments before being considered for removal from non-accrual status. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are classified as impaired if management determines that full collection of principal and interest, in accordance with the terms of the loan documents, is not probable. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected from the collateral. Loans are evaluated for impairment when payments are delayed, typically 90 days or more, or when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the original terms of the loan. As of June 30, 2023, impaired loans totaled 405, of which 54 are included in non-accrual loans. Continued unsuccessful collection efforts generally lead to initiation of foreclosure or other legal proceedings.

The non-performing loans are either in the process of foreclosure or efforts are being made to work with the borrower to bring the loan current. Properties and vehicles acquired by the Corporation as a result of foreclosure or repossession, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, are classified as other real estate and repossessed assets owned until they are sold or otherwise disposed of.

While management s periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses may allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loan situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-off that may occur. While the Corporation has historically experienced strong trends in asset quality, due to the current economic concerns with high inflation and rising interest rates, uncertainty remains regarding future levels of criticized and classified loans, nonperforming loans and charge-offs. Management will continue to closely monitor changes in the loan portfolio and adjust the provision accordingly.

Other Assets: As of June 30, 2023, the total accrued interest receivable and other assets were 22,967 compared with 10,184 as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, a 10,250 investment in a limited partnership that invests in qualified affordable housing projects that will generate tax benefits for the investors is included in other assets. See Note 16 Affordable Tax Credit Partnership to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning the low-income housing tax credit investment. 
 
 Deposits. Total deposits increased by 65,971, or 7.4 , from 886,562 at June 30, 2022 to 952,533 at June 30, 2023.

Short-term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings increased by 5,072, or 23.8 , to 26,367 at June 30, 2023 from 21,295 at June 30, 2022. This increase was primarily associated with large new deposits from existing local commercial customers into the sweep repurchase agreement product that is fully collateralized. See Note 8 Short-Term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning short-term borrowings. 
 
 Other Liabilities: As of June 30, 2023, the total accrued interest payable and other liabilities was 16,864 compared with 7,230 as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, an unfunded commitment of 9,668 associated with an affordable housing tax credit investment was included in other liabilities. See Note 16 Affordable Tax Credit Partnership to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning the low-income housing tax credit investment. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Total shareholders equity increased by 1,514 from 53,970 as of June 30, 2022 to 55,484 at June 30, 2023. The primary reason for the increase in shareholders equity was because of net income of 10,674 for the 2023 fiscal year which was partially offset by an increase of 7,855 in the accumulated other comprehensive loss from the mark-to-market of available-for-sale securities and from cash dividends paid of 2,095. The total accumulated other comprehensive loss was 29,961 as of June 30, 2023. Available-for-sale securities and shareholders equity were impacted by rapidly rising interest rates during 2022 and 2023 causing the accumulated other comprehensive loss to increase as available-for-sale securities are marked to fair market value. As market interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decline with a corresponding net of tax decline recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss portion of equity. This unrealized loss in securities is temporary and is adjusted monthly for additional market interest rate fluctuations, principal paydowns, calls, and maturities. The Corporation has significant sources of liquidity and therefore does not expect to have to sell securities to fund growth. 

19

For fiscal year 2023, the average equity to average total assets ratio was 5.16 and the dividend payout ratio was 19.6 . For fiscal year 2022, the average equity to average total assets ratio was 7.10 and the dividend payout ratio was 17.4 . 
 
 At June 30, 2023, management believes the Bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements. Based on the Bank s computed regulatory capital ratios, the OCC has determined the Bank to be well capitalized under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act as of its latest exam date. The Bank s actual and required capital amounts are disclosed in Note 13-Regulatory Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management is not aware of any matters occurring subsequent to that exam that would cause the Bank s capital category to change. 
 
 At June 30, 2023, the Corporation had no unconsolidated, related special purpose entities, nor did the Corporation engage in hedging contracts, such as interest rate swaps, which may expose the Corporation to liabilities greater than the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. The Corporation s investment policy prohibits engaging in derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes; however, in the future, the Corporation may pursue certain contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to execute a sound and defensive interest rate risk management policy. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Management considers the asset position of the Bank to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Bank s earning assets are divided primarily between loans and available-for-sale securities, with any excess funds placed in federal funds sold or interest-bearing deposit accounts with other financial institutions. 
 
 For fiscal year 2023, net cash inflows from operating activities were 13,316, net cash inflows from financing activities were 69,706 and net cash outflows from investing activities were 92,219. Major sources of cash were a 65,971 net increase in deposits and 37,794 in cash received from sales, maturities, or principal pay downs of available-for-sale securities. Major uses of cash were a 98,945 net increase in loans and 31,799 of purchases of available-for-sale securities. Total cash and cash equivalents were 20,952 as of June 30, 2023 compared to 18,529 at June 30, 2022. 
 
 The Bank groups its loan portfolio into four major categories: commercial loans; commercial real estate loans; 1-4 family residential real estate loans; and consumer loans. The Bank s 1-4 family residential real estate loan portfolio primarily consists of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans for terms generally not longer than thirty years and variable rate home equity lines of credit. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are comprised of both variable rate notes subject to interest rate changes based on the prime rate or Treasury index, and fixed rate notes having maturities of generally not greater than twenty years. Consumer loans offered by the Bank are generally written for periods of up to seven years, based on the nature of the collateral. These may be either installment loans having regular monthly payments or demand type loans for short periods of time. 
 
 Funds not allocated to the Bank s loan portfolio are invested in various securities having diverse maturity schedules. A majority of the Bank s securities are held in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored entities, mortgage-backed securities, and investments in tax-exempt municipal bonds. 
 
 The Bank offers several forms of deposit products to its customers. We believe the rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with others currently available in the market area. While the Bank continues to be under competitive pressures in the Bank s market area as financial institutions attempt to attract and keep new deposits, we believe many commercial and retail customers are turning to community banks. Compared to our peers, the Corporation s core deposits consist of a larger percentage of noninterest-bearing demand deposits resulting in a lower cost of funds of 1.03 for fiscal year 2023. 
 
 Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of 250 and over) were 46,822 and 18,164 at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These deposits are monitored closely by the Bank and typically priced on an individual basis. When these deposits are from a municipality, certain bank-owned securities are pledged to guarantee the safety of these public fund deposits as required by Ohio law. The Corporation has the option to use a fee paid broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding. However, these deposits are not relied upon as a primary source of funding and there were no brokered deposits as of June 30, 2023 or 2022. 
 
 To provide additional sources of liquidity, the Corporation has lines of credit with other financial institutions and has entered into agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. As of June 30, 2023, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled 8,776 compared with 8,256 as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional 109,442 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The Corporation considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base.

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends the Bank can pay without regulatory approval. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. Additionally, the Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be undercapitalized, as defined in the federal regulations. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank could, without prior approval, declare a dividend of approximately 21,811. 
 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations primarily in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of the Corporation are monetary in nature. Therefore, as a financial institution, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Corporation s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. The liquidity, maturity structure and quality of the Corporation s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 
 
 The financial condition and results of operations for the Corporation presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and management s discussion and analysis are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Corporation s accounting policies. The selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments, estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation are presented in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. 
 
 Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. In the event different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending upon the severity of such changes, the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood. Management has identified the following as critical accounting policies: 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses. The determination of the allowance for loan losses involves considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience, the size and composition of the portfolio, current economic events and conditions and other pertinent factors, including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies, recoveries, and losses. All these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Among the many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses, some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. Although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses, the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management s estimates, additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact the Corporation s financial condition or earnings in future periods. 
 
 Goodwill. The Corporation accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value recorded as goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The evaluation for impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the current estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no additional testing is required, and an impairment loss is not recorded. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, further valuation procedures are performed that could result in impairment of goodwill being recorded. Further valuation procedures would include allocating the estimated fair value to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the implied value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 
 Management evaluated goodwill as of April 30, 2023, the measurement date, utilizing an income approach that incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involved management assumptions based upon future growth and earnings projections. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was then compared to the current carrying value to determine if impairment had occurred. It is our opinion that, as of the measurement date, the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. Therefore, management concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, actual results may vary significantly and it is impossible to know the future impact of evolving economic conditions. If for any future period it is determined that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances, the Corporation will record a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on net income, but not risk based capital ratios.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors 
 Consumers Bancorp, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumers Bancorp, Inc and subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022; the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended; and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses - Significant Assumptions in General Reserves - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The allowance for loan losses (allowance) represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers nonimpaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; volume and severity of past-due loans and other similar conditions; quality of the loan review system; value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. 

23

We identified the Company s significant assumptions in general reserves in the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter. Given the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to estimate the current factor adjustments of the allowance for loan losses, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the qualitative factors within the allowance included the following, among others: 

We obtained an understanding of management s process for determining the need for qualitative factor adjustments, identifying appropriate factors, and measuring the direction and magnitude of the adjustments. 

We evaluated the reasonableness of management s judgments and tests of accuracy of underlying support related to the qualitative factors. 

We evaluated the design of controls over the application of management s qualitative factor methodology in the estimate of general reserves. 

We evaluated management's rationale for determining qualitative adjustments were relevant and warranted for each loan segment and assessed the measurement of qualitative factor adjustments applied by management. 

Where applicable, we tested the accuracy and completeness of data used by management in the measurement of qualitative factor adjustments or vouched factors to relevant external data sources. 

We assessed changes in qualitative factors year over year against overall trends in credit quality within the Company and broader trends within the industry and local and national economies to evaluate reasonableness of management s qualitative factor adjustments.

When OTTI occurs, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether the Corporation intends to sell the security, or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Corporation intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the security. If a security is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, but the Corporation does not intend to sell the security, only the credit portion of the estimated loss is recognized in earnings, with the other portion of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. 

Commercial Real Estate: Commercial real estate loans include mortgage loans to farmers, owners of multi-family investment properties, developers and owners of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan, the business conducted on the property securing the loan or, in the case of loans to farmers, management and operation of the farm. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Corporation s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the Corporation s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus nonowner-occupied loans. 1 - 4 Family Residential Real Estate : Residential real estate loans are secured by one to four family residential properties and include both owner occupied, non-owner occupied and home equity loans. Credit approval for residential real estate loans requires demonstration of sufficient income to repay the principal and interest and the real estate taxes and insurance, stability of employment, an established credit record and an appropriately appraised value of the real estate securing the loan that generally requires that the residential real estate loan amount be no more than 85 of the purchase price or the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan unless the borrower provides private mortgage insurance. Consumer : The Corporation originates direct and indirect consumer loans, primarily automobile loans, personal lines of credit, and unsecured consumer loans in its primary market areas. Credit approval for consumer loans requires income sufficient to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, an established credit record and sufficient collateral for secured loans. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to real estate mortgage loans, but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. 

and total cash surrender values of . As of June 30, 2022, the Bank had policies with total death benefits of and total cash surrender values of . Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Tax-exempt income is recognized from the periodic increases in cash surrender value of these policies. 

The Corporation adopted this new guidance on July 1, 2023. Management analyzed and finalized its pool segmentation, established the peer group that will be used as the source of loss experience data, and completed parallel calculations in preparation for adoption of the new methodology. The Net Present Value of Discounted Cash Flow methodology is being used for all loan pools and the implementation of ASU No. 2016 - 13 is expected to increase the balance of the allowance for loan losses by less than . In addition, a reserve for unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable will be established and is expected to be between and . Upon adoption of the new guidance, a one -time adjustment to the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments will be made with an offsetting decrease to retained earnings, net of tax. The Corporation is also developing disclosure documentation related to adoption of this standard. In March 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022 - 02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (ASC 326 ): Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures. The guidance amends ASC 326 to eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying TDR recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will be required to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or continuation of existing loan. These amendments are intended to enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the amendments in ASC 326 require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination within the vintage disclosures, which require that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. The guidance is only for entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016 - 13 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. This update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation s financial statements.

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI by segregating the portfolio into two general segments and applying the appropriate OTTI model. Investment securities are generally evaluated for OTTI under FASB ASC Topic 320, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . 
 
 In determining OTTI under the ASC Topic 320 model, management considers many factors, including: 1 the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, 2 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, 3 whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and 4 whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation s securities portfolio consisted of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. There were available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2023, of which were in a continuous loss position for twelve or more months. There were held-to-maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2023. The unrealized losses within the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity security portfolios in fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributed to a change in rates. The mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were primarily issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. The Corporation does not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. Also, management monitors the financial condition of the individual municipal securities to ensure they meet minimum credit standards, all are paying as agreed, and there have been no missed payments. Since the Corporation does not intend to sell these securities and it is not likely the Corporation will be required to sell these securities at an unrealized loss position prior to any anticipated recovery in fair value, which may be maturity, management does not believe there is any OTTI related to these securities at June 30, 2023. Also, there was no OTTI recognized at June 30, 2022. 
 
 As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation owned equity securities with an amortized cost of . The following table presents the net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities recognized in earnings for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR): 
 The Corporation has certain loans that have been modified in order to maximize collection of loan balances that are classified as TDRs. A modified loan is usually classified as a TDR if, for economic reasons, management grants a concession to the original terms and conditions of the loan to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties that it would not have otherwise considered. 
 
 The Corporation had and of loans classified as TDRs as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were specific reserves allocated to these loans and TDRs are also included as impaired loans that are listed above. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were loans modified that were classified as a troubled debt restructuring. 
 
 There were loans classified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within 12 months following the modification during the twelve -month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. A loan is considered in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators: 
 The Corporation categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Corporation analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes loans with a total outstanding loan relationship greater than and non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed monthly. The Corporation uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
 
 Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution's credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 
 Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated are either less than 100 or are included in groups of homogeneous loans. These loans are evaluated based on delinquency status, which was discussed previously.

 As of June 30, 2023, the Corporation leased real estate for seven office locations and various equipment under operating lease agreements. The lease agreements have maturity dates ranging from one year or less to May 31, 2035, including extension periods. Lease agreements for two locations have a lease term of 12 months or less and are therefore considered short-term leases. Most leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is typically at our sole discretion. The majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are included in our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as they are reasonably certain of exercise. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the fully collateralized FHLB borrowing rate, commensurate with the lease terms based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average remaining life of the lease term for the leases with a term over 12 months was years as of June 30, 2023 and the weighted-average discount rate was . 

Rent expense for all the operating leases was and for the twelve -month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The right-of-use asset, included in premises and equipment, and the lease liability, included in other liabilities, were and as of June 30, 2023.

The following table summarizes the Corporation s acquired intangible assets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Goodwill and the core deposit intangible assets resulted from the acquisition of Peoples Bancorp of Mt. Pleasant, Inc. that was completed on January 1, 2020, and the branch acquisition that was completed on July 16, 2021. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. Impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. For the goodwill impairment analysis, the Corporation is the only reporting unit. Management performed a quantitative impairment assessment at April 30, 2023. The assessment estimated fair value on an income approach that incorporated a discounted cash flow model that involved management assumptions based upon future growth and earnings projections. The results of the assessment indicated impairment as of the measurement date. Goodwill is the only intangible asset on the Corporation s balance sheet with an indefinite life. Management will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible impairment. 
 
 The core deposit intangible asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years. The Corporation recorded intangible amortization expense of in 2023 and in 2022. The intangible amortization expense is expected to be per year for each of the next four fiscal years and thereafter.

Amounts charged to operations were and for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The Bank maintains a nonqualified Salary Continuation Plan (SCP) to reward and encourage certain Bank executives to remain employees of the Bank. The SCP is considered an unfunded plan for tax and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) purposes and all obligations arising under the SCP are payable from the general assets of the Corporation. The estimated present value of future benefits to be paid to certain current and former executives totaled as of June 30, 2023 and as of June 30, 2022 and is included in other liabilities. For purposes of calculating the present value of future benefits, a discount rate of was used to project the liability through June 30, 2023 and was used at June 30, 2022. For the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and , respectively, have been charged to expense in connection with the SCP. Distributions to participants were for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. 
 
 The Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2010 Plan) is a nonqualified share-based compensation plan. The 2010 Plan was established to promote alignment between key employees performance and the Corporation s shareholder interests by motivating performance through the award of stock-based compensation. The purpose of the 2010 Plan was to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees and compensate outside directors for their service to the Corporation. The 2010 Plan was approved by the Corporation s shareholders. The Compensation Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors has sole authority to select the employees, establish the awards to be issued, and approve the terms and conditions of each award contract. 

Under the 2010 Plan, the Corporation could grant, among other things, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or any combination thereof to any employee and outside director. Each award was evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the number of shares awarded, the vesting period, the performance requirements, and such other provisions as the Compensation Committee determines. Upon a change-in-control of the Corporation, as defined in the 2010 Plan, all outstanding awards immediately vest. 
 
 The Corporation has granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors. Restricted stock units and awards are issued at no cost to the recipient and can be settled in shares or cash at the end of the vesting period depending on the type of award. Restricted stock awards are made at the end of the measurement period once certain specified performance targets as established by the Compensation Committee are achieved with some awards fully vesting on the date of grant and others vesting on the grant date, with the remaining vesting per year over a three -year period. Restricted stock awards provide the holder with dividends during the vesting period. Cash dividends are reinvested into shares of stock and are subject to the same restrictions and vesting as the initial award. Restricted stock units begin to vest at the end of the measurement period once certain specified performance targets as established by the Compensation Committee are achieved. Some units, primarily the awards made to directors and senior management, are vested at the end of the measurement period. For other unit awards, primarily the awards made to executive management, vest at the end of the performance period, with the remaining vesting per year over a three -year period. The fair value of the restricted stock units and awards, which is used to measure compensation expense, is the closing market price of the Corporation s common stock on the date of the grant and compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period. All dividends are forfeitable in the event the shares do not vest. 
 
 The following table summarizes the status of the restricted stock awards and restricted stock units:

that is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The net unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in computing regulatory capital. Management believes as of June 30, 2023, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject. 
 
 The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 for the Bank:

As of the latest regulatory examination, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized. There are no conditions or events since that examination that management believes may have changed the Bank s category. 
 
 The Corporation s principal source of funds for dividend payment is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. As of June 30, 2023 the Bank could, without prior approval, declare a dividend of approximately .

 Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include the following: 
 
 Impaired Loans: At the time a loan is considered impaired, it is valued at the lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses or are charged down to their fair value. For collateral dependent loans, fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
 
 Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets Owned: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Real estate owned properties and other repossessed assets, which are primarily vehicles, are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. There was no other real estate owned or other repossessed assets being carried at fair value as of June 30, 2023 or June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the balance of other real estate owned was . 
 
 There were assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2023 or 2022 and there was impact to the provision for loan losses for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. 
 
 The following table shows the estimated fair values of financial instruments that are reported at amortized cost in the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value: 

Level 2 inputs: 
 Certificates of deposit in other financial institutions 
 Loans held for sale 
 Accrued interest receivable 
 Level 3 inputs: 
 Securities held-to-maturity 
 Loans, net 
 Financial Liabilities: 
 Level 2 inputs: 
 Demand and savings deposits 
 Time deposits 
 Short-term borrowings 
 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 
 Accrued interest payable 

The assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying value of cash and deposits in other financial institutions were considered to approximate fair value resulting in a Level 1 classification. 
 
 Certificates of deposits in other financial institutions: Fair value of certificates of deposits in other financial institutions was estimated using current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
 
 Accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings : The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings were considered to approximate fair value due to their short-term duration resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
 
 Loans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
 
 Loans: Fair value for loans was estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks as well as general portfolio credit risk. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 
 
 Securities held-to-maturity: The held-to-maturity securities are general obligation and revenue bonds issued by local municipalities. The fair value of these securities are calculated using a spread to the applicable municipal fair market curve resulting in a Level 3 classification. 
 
 Time deposits: Fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit was estimated using the rates offered at June 30, 2023 and 2022 for deposits of similar remaining maturities, resulting in Level 2 classification. Estimated fair value does not include the benefit that results from low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank advances: Fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances was estimated using current rates at June 30, 2023 and 2022 for similar financing resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
 
 Federal bank and other restricted stocks, at cost: Federal bank and other restricted stocks include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock that are accounted for at cost due to restrictions placed on their transferability, and, therefore, are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements. 
 
 Off-balance sheet commitments: The Corporation s lending commitments have variable interest rates and escape clauses if the customer s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the above table. 

and the balance of the associated unfunded commitment was . As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Corporation by the creditors of the limited partnership, however, the tax credits are generally subject to recapture should the partnership fail to comply with the applicable government regulations.

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

OVERVIEW OF POLICY 

Consumers Bancorp, Inc. CNB or the Company is a public company, the common stock of which is registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Pursuant to the Exchange Act, CNB files periodic reports and proxy statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Investment by executive officers, directors and employees in CNB stock is generally desirable and encouraged. However, it is important that investing in the Company s securities does not create the appearance of impropriety, and that all investment activities comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

As a director, executive officer or employee of a public company, you have the responsibility not to participate in the market for CNB stock while in possession of material, non-public information about the Company. You also have the responsibility not to participate in the market for securities of any other publicly traded company while in possession of material non-public information that was obtained in the course of your involvement with the Company. There are harsh civil and criminal penalties if you trade securities while in possession of material, non-public information, or if you give that information to another person who uses it in buying or selling securities. If you buy or sell securities while in possession of material non-public information, you will not only have to pay back any money you made, but you could be found guilty of criminal charges, and face substantial fines or even prison. Additionally, CNB could be held liable for your violations of insider trading laws. 

Our directors and executive officers also have the responsibility to comply with the short-swing profit rule in Section 16(b) and file periodic reports regarding changes in ownership of CNB stock pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Violations or failure to comply with these Section 16 restrictions can also result in SEC enforcement action against those individuals. 

In order to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to help avoid these harsh consequences, CNB has developed this Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy (the Policy to briefly explain the insider trading laws and set forth the Company s policies and guidelines with respect to transactions in Company securities. The Policy also sets forth pre-clearance requirements and procedures for executive officers, directors and designated individuals, and describes the procedures our executive officers and directors should follow to ensure the timely filing of their Section 16 reports with the SEC. However, it does not address all possible situations that you may face. In addition, you need to review and understand CNB s Information Disclosure Policy that describes your obligations under the Exchange Act regarding the selective disclosure of confidential information to ensure compliance with SEC Regulation FD, which requires fair disclosure of material, non-public information. 

This Policy applies to all directors, executive officers and employees of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and to family members, other members of a person s household and entities controlled by a person covered by this Policy (as more fully described below). The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors who may have access to material non-public information. 

This Policy applies to all trading or other transactions in the Company s securities, including purchases, sales and bona fide gifts of Company securities. This Policy also prohibits trading or other transactions in the securities of any other publicly traded company while in possession of material non-public information that was obtained in the course of your involvement with the Company. When used in this Policy, the term securities should be interpreted broadly and includes, without limitation, the Company s (or such other company s) common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities including but not limited to other equity awards, preferred stock, debt securities, convertible securities, warrants, as well as derivative securities such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to the Company s securities (whether or not issued by the Company).

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

INSIDER TRADING CONCEPTS 

What is "Inside" Information? 

Inside information includes anything you become aware of because of your special relationship with the Company as an employee, executive officer or director, which has not been disclosed to the public. The information may be about the Company or any of its bank subsidiaries or other affiliates. It may also include information you learn about another company, for example, companies that are current or prospective customers or suppliers to a bank subsidiary or those with which the Company may be in negotiations regarding a potential transaction. 

What is Material Information? 

Information is material if a reasonable investor would think that it is important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold securities. Information that could be expected to affect the market price of the stock should be considered material. Either good or bad information may be material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing materiality; rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all the facts and circumstances and is often evaluated by enforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. If you are unsure whether the information is material, assume it is material. 

Examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material in particular situations include, but are not limited to: 

Company financial performance; 

estimates or projections of future earnings or losses; 

events that could result in restating financial information; 

a proposed merger, acquisition or sale; 

beginning or settling a major lawsuit; 

regulatory agency investigation; 

management changes; 

changes in dividend policies; 

declaring a dividend or stock split; 

a stock or bond offering; or 

winning a large new contract (or losing a large contract). 

What is Non-public Information? 

Non-public information is information that has not yet been made public by the Company. Information only becomes public when the Company makes an official announcement (in a publicly accessible press release or in SEC filings, for example) and people have had an opportunity to see or hear it. Therefore, you should not buy or sell stocks or other securities before the public announcement of material information and the passage of sufficient time to allow the market to absorb the information. As a general rule, information should not be considered to be fully absorbed by the marketplace until after the second full trading day after the day on which the information is released.

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

POLICY STATEMENT AND TRADING GUIDELINES 

Prohibition Against Trading While In Possession of Material Non-Public Information 

No director, executive officer or employee of the Company (or other person designated as subject to this Policy) may, directly, or indirectly through family members or other persons or entities, engage or recommend others engage in transactions in, purchase or sell stocks or other securities of CNB or of any other company when aware of any material, non-public information about that company, no matter how you learned the information. You also must not tip or otherwise give material, non-public information to anyone, including people in your immediate family, friends or anyone acting for you (such as a stockbroker), and must not assist anyone engaged in the above activities. 

In addition, it is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other employee of the Company (or other person designated as subject to this Policy) who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic information about a company with which the Company does business, including a customer or supplier of the Company, may trade in, or suggest that others trade in, that company's securities until the information becomes public or is no longer material. 

There are no exceptions to this Policy, except as specifically provided under the heading Exception for Trading Plans Implemented in Accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1. 

Transactions by Family Members 

This Policy also applies to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company securities) (collectively, Family Members ). You are responsible for the transactions of these other persons and therefore should make them aware of the need to confer with you before they trade in the Company's securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions of family members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by or related to you or your Family Members. 

Transactions by Entities that You Influence or Control 

This Policy applies to any entities that you control, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts, and transactions by these entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. Pre-Clearance Policy for Trading While Not in Possession of Material Non-Public Information 

Directors, Section 16 Officers and other individuals listed on (or who become insiders as described in) Attachment B Designated Employees ), as well as the Family Members and entities controlled by such persons, may not trade at any time, without prior clearance . If you are a director, Section 16 Officer or Designated Employee, before trading in CNB stock you must contact the President/CEO or the CFO to inquire if a restricted trading period is in effect and to obtain pre-clearance of the contemplated trade. When practical, pre-clearance will be granted in a written format, otherwise it will be granted orally. Trading includes not only purchases and sales of stock, but also acquisitions and dispositions of equity derivative securities and stock swap agreements, the exercise of certain options, warrants, puts and calls, etc. In addition, gifts shall be subject to this Policy (including pre-clearance and blackout restrictions). 

Restricted trading periods (commonly referred to as black out periods) are periods designated by CNB as times in which directors, Section 16 Officers and other Designated Employees, their Family Members and entities controlled by such persons may not trade in CNB stock regardless of your actual possession or non-possession of material, non-public information. These restricted trading periods are instituted by CNB for a variety of reasons. One such restricted trading period is instituted prior to CNB releasing its quarterly results. This restricted trading period begins one full calendar week prior to the end of every calendar quarter and lasts until two full trading days after CNB releases its results for that quarter.

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 also requires the Company to absolutely prohibit all purchases, sales or transfers of CNB securities by directors and executive officers during a pension fund blackout period. A pension fund blackout period exists whenever 50 or more of the plan participants are unable to conduct transactions in their accounts for more than three consecutive days. These blackout periods typically occur when there is a change in the retirement plan s trustee, record keeper or investment manager. You will be contacted when these or other restricted trading periods are instituted. 

If, upon requesting clearance, you are advised that Company stock may be traded, you may buy or sell the stock within two business days after clearance is granted, but only if you are not otherwise in possession of material, non-public information . If for any reason the trade is not completed within two business days, pre-clearance must be obtained again before stock may be traded. 

If, upon requesting clearance, you are advised that Company stock may not be traded, you may not engage in any trade of any type under any circumstances, nor may you inform anyone of the restriction. You may reapply for pre-clearance at a later date when trading restrictions may no longer be applicable. In sum, it is critical that our directors, Section 16 Officers and other Designated Employees obtain pre-clearance of any trading to prevent both inadvertent Section 16(b) or insider trading violations and to avoid even the appearance of an improper transaction (which could result, for example, when an officer engages in a trade while unaware of a pending major development). 

Additional Prohibited Transactions 

It is improper and inappropriate to engage in short-term or speculative transactions involving Company securities. It is the Company s policy that no director, executive officer or employee of the Company or other person subject to this Policy shall engage in any of the following activities with respect to Company securities: 

Trading securities on a short-term basis. Any Company security purchased must be held for a minimum of six months and ideally longer. 

Purchases of Company securities on margin/pledging of securities. 

Buying or selling puts or calls 

Hedging or options trading. 

Exception for Trading Plans Implemented in Accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1 

Definition of Trading Plan . 

This Policy does not prohibit the purchase or sale of CNB stock made by you in accordance with a pre-existing written plan, contract or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, provided the procedures described in this section are complied with. Rule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5. Rule 10b5-1 provides that a person's purchase or sale is not on the basis of material non-public information if the person making the purchase or sale demonstrates that before becoming aware of the information, the person had: 

Entered into a binding contract to purchase or sell the security, 

Instructed another person to purchase or sell the security for the instructing person's account, or 

Adopted a written plan for trading securities (a Trading Plan that satisfies certain requirements specified in the Rule.

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

The Trading Plan must be documented in writing, entered into in good faith and established prior to the transaction(s) in question at a time when you are not aware of material inside information. The Trading Plan must specify the price, amount and date of trades or provide a formula or mechanism to be followed. The amount can be either a specified number of shares or dollar value of securities. The price can be the market price on a particular date, a floor price, or a particular dollar price. The Trading Plan cannot provide you with the ability to exercise any later influence over how, when and whether to conduct purchases or sales under the plan. The Trading Plan must include a cooling-off period before trading can commence that satisfies the requirements in the Rule as further explained below. A person may not enter into overlapping Rule 10b5-1 plans (subject to certain exceptions), and may only enter into one single-trade Rule 10b5-1 plan during any 12-month period (subject to certain exceptions). Certain representations must be included in director and Section 16 Officer plans. All persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 plan must act in good faith with respect to the Trading Plan throughout its duration. Certain Trading Plan modifications would be treated as termination of an existing plan and entry into a new plan, and certain Trading Plan modifications and terminations may require Company disclosures. Accordingly, Trading Plan modifications and terminations also must be pre-approved in accordance with this Policy. 

Procedures Applicable to Trading Plans . 

No purchase or sale of CNB stock shall be treated as having been made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan under this Policy unless the following procedures and requirements are met: 

The Trading Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. 

The Trading Plan is established when no blackout period is in effect. 

The Trading Plan has been approved by the President/CEO or the CFO (the Approving Officer and the Approving Officer has certified such approval in writing. This pre-clearance requirement applies to the establishment, modification or termination of any plan, arrangement or trading instructions, involving potential sales or purchases of shares, option exercises and sales or gifts, and applies even if you have been assured by a broker, personal attorney, financial advisor or other professional that the trading arrangement meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. 

The person establishing the Trading Plan has certified to the Approving Officer in writing no earlier than two business days prior to the date that the Trading Plan is formally established, that: 

o 

Such person is not in possession of material non-public information concerning the Company and all such trades to be made pursuant to Trading Plan will be made strictly in accordance with the terms of the Trading Plan and Rule 10b5-1; 

o 

Such person has no other overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans in place and, if the Trading Plan is for a single trade, has not had any other single-trade Trading Plan in place in the last 12 months; and 

o 

The Trading Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1.

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

In addition, Section 16 Officer and director Trading Plans must include representations at the time of adoption or modification that (i) the person is not aware of material non-public information about the Company or Company securities and (ii) the person is adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5. 

For Section 16 Officers and directors, no transaction may take place under the Trading Plan until the later of (a) 90 days after adoption or modification (as specified in Rule 10b5-1) of the Trading Plan or (b) two business days following the disclosure of the Company s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K for the fiscal quarter (the Company s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of a Form 10-K) in which the Trading Plan was adopted or modified (as specified in Rule 10b5-1), subject to a maximum cooling-off period of 120 days after adoption or modification of the plan. 

For persons other than Section 16 Officers and directors, no transaction may take place under a Trading Plan until 30 days following the adoption or modification (as specified in Rule 10b5-1) of a Trading Plan. 

Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in Rule 10b5-1, you may not enter into more than one Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan at the same time. 

Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in Rule 10b5-1, you are limited to only one Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan designed to effect an open market purchase or sale of the total amount of securities subject to the Rule 10b-1 Trading Plan as a single transaction in any 12-month period. 

You must act in good faith with respect to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan cannot be entered into as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibition of Rule 10b-5. Therefore, although modifications to an existing Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan are not prohibited, a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan should be adopted with the intention that it will not be amended or terminated prior to its expiration. In addition, certain plan modifications are treated under the Rule as the termination of a plan and entry into a new plan and may require the Company to make certain disclosures. Accordingly, any Trading Plan modifications or terminations must be pre-approved by an Approving Officer. 

You may not enter into any transaction in Company securities while your Trading Plan is in effect. 

No approval of a Trading Plan by the Approving Officer shall be considered the Approving Officer's or the Company's confirmation that the Trading Plan satisfies the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. It shall be the sole responsibility of the person establishing the Trading Plan to ensure that such plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. 

The Company and the Company s Section 16 Officers and directors must make certain disclosures in SEC filings concerning Rule 10b5-1 Plans. Section 16 Officers and directors of the Company must undertake to provide any information requested by the Company regarding Rule 10b5-1 Plans for the purpose of providing the required disclosures or any other disclosures that the Company deems to be appropriate under the circumstances. The approval or adoption of a pre-planned selling program in no way reduces or eliminates a Section 16 Officer s or director s obligations under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including such person s disclosure and short-swing trading liabilities thereunder. 

SECTION 16 REPORTING 

Overview 

The SEC s rules under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as well as Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 impose reporting requirements on executive officers, directors and 10 shareholders. If there is any change in your ownership of CNB securities at any time, other than through certain exempt Company benefit plans, you will be required to file a Form 4 with the SEC reporting the change. In virtually all cases, the Form 4 must be filed no later than the second business day following the execution date of the transaction. For transactions under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans or certain discretionary transactions within exempt Company benefit plans (for example, fund switching transactions), the Form 4 may not be due until the second business day following the date your broker or plan administrator notifies you of the execution date, but in no event more than five business days after the execution date. 

Page 8

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

Sales of CNB securities by its affiliates are subject to specific regulations under the federal securities laws. Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 provides a safe harbor procedure under which certain sales by affiliates are permitted. Each officer and director is deemed to be an affiliate and thus each officer and director need to comply with Rule 144 when selling common shares held either directly or beneficially. 

Form 144 is required if more than 5,000 shares or shares valued at more than 50,000 are sold during any three-month period. Further, Rule 144 places limitations on the number of common shares that may be sold under the safe harbor rule. Generally, the number of common shares that may be sold in any three-month period is 1 of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold. 

You are also required to report certain exempt transactions to the SEC at year-end on a Form 5. The number and types of transactions eligible for Form 5 reporting are very limited. 

Gifts 

As long as a gift of shares is bona fide, it is an exempt transaction for purposes of the Section 16 profit recovery provisions. However, you could be exposed to Section 16 liability if you make a gift of shares to a family member or related entity and that donee sells the shares within six months. Thus, except in the case of gifts of shares to a public charity, it is recommended that you have an understanding with the donee to obtain your clearance prior to a sale of any gifted shares. Although exempt from profit recovery under Section 16, gifts must be reported, and dispositions of securities by gift must be reported on Form 4 no later than two business days after the gift. In addition, gifts are subject to the Insider Trading Policy and Trading Guidelines as set forth above. 

Consequences of Delinquent Filings 

The consequences of a late filing or the failure to file required Section 16 reports are significant: 

public embarrassment to you and the Company from required disclosures in the proxy statement and Form 10-K; 

potential SEC enforcement actions against you, such as a cease-and-desist order or injunction against further wrongdoing; and 

for egregious or repeated violations, possible criminal penalties can be imposed which can include SEC fines of up to 5,000 per day for each filing violation and/or imprisonment. 

Section 16 Compliance Program 

Under SEC rules, the preparation and filing of Section 16(a) reports is your sole responsibility. However, because of the complexities of compliance with the Section 16(a) filing requirements and to help prevent inadvertent violations of the short-swing profit rules, the Company has determined that it is prudent to provide you with assistance in preparing and filing your reports. In this regard, the following compliance procedures have been implemented: 

Designated Filing Coordinator 

The CFO and other select members of the Accounting Department can assist all executive officers and directors in preparing, reviewing and filing all Forms 3, 4 and 5. A Form 3 initial report has been filed for all current executive officers and directors. 

Page 9

Insider Trading and Section 16 Reporting Policy 
			 Revision date: April 13, 2023 

Preparation and Filing 

If you have any transaction or change in ownership in your Company stock or other equity securities (including derivative securities, and including any gifts), please report the transaction(s) to the Filing Coordinator no later than the execution date of the transaction. The Filing Coordinator will contact you each July to coordinate preparation of your Form 5 (if applicable). 

Upon receiving the details of the transaction(s) from you, the Filing Coordinator will prepare each Form 4 and Form 5 on your behalf. Due to the short two-day period in which to file the reports, the Filing Coordinator may have the Form executed on your behalf using the power of attorney that you have granted to the Company for this purpose and will file the completed Form with the SEC. As discussed above, the SEC must receive the Form 4 no later than the second business day following almost any transaction (including for dispositions by gift), and Form 5 must be received by August 14 th each year, so time is of the essence. The Filing Coordinator will send you a copy of the Form 4 or 5 as filed with the SEC promptly following the filing. Please contact the Filing Coordinator immediately if you believe there may be any errors in the filing. If so, the Filing Coordinator will promptly amend the Form. In most cases, the filing of an amendment to correct information will not result in the initial filing being deemed a late filing; so no proxy disclosure or other penalties should apply. 

The Ultimate Responsibility Rests on You 

While the Company has decided to assist executive officers and directors with Section 16 compliance, you should recognize that it will remain your legal obligation to ensure that your filings are made timely and correctly, and that you do not engage in unlawful short-swing transactions. The Company can only facilitate your compliance to the extent you provide the Company with the information required by this Policy. The Company does not assume any legal responsibility in this regard. If you would like more detailed information regarding your Section 16 obligations, please contact the Filing Coordinator.
