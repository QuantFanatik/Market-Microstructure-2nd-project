Description of Business FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as may, will, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, approximate or continue, or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management s best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 16, 2018. We were engaged in the business of selling beauty sample subscriptions. In December 2020, we acquired several gold mining claims in Canada as we have switched our focus to the mining industry. We planned to begin exploration on the properties. Due to Covid and economic downturn, we were unable to proceed with the mining property exploration. Upon the expiration of the two years term of the property mining rights, we decided not to extend beyond the original term of the mining rights and was fully impaired through year ended April 30, 2023. On October 18, 2022, majority of the Company s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to twenty (20) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock. The reverse stock split was approved by FINRA for approval on February 21, 2023. The financial statements retroactively reflect the reverse stock split. On January 8, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with a surveying consulting firm for mining and mineral exploration and surveying services on Potter County, PA Utica Shale area oil and gas properties. On February 14, 2023, the Company s name changed to Natural Resources Holdings, Inc. and the Company trading symbol will change to NRHI effective 20 business days from February 21, 2023. We are currently in negotiations to acquire other mining rights. EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. Item 1A. Risk Factors Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 2. Description of Property We do not own any real estate or other properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We know of no legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is the subject which are pending, threatened or contemplated or any unsatisfied judgments against us. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None. 3 Table of Contents PART II Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Market Information There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a company s operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. As of April 30, 2023, no shares of our common stock have traded. Number of Holders As of July 27, 2023, the 5,209,891 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 10 shareholder of record.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Results of Operations We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. The following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, which are included herein: Year Ended April 30, Changes 2023 2022 Amount Operating Expenses (54,455 (29,838 (24,617 83 Other Income (Expenses) 13,711 (240,656 254,367 (106 Net Loss (40,744 (270,494 229,750 (85 During the year ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not earn any revenue.

The decrease in net loss during the year ended April 30, 2023 was due to the decrease in other expenses. During the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company incurred impairment of property mining rights of 125,000 and interest and penalty on non-filing on previous years income tax returns of 125,000.

The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year ended April 30, 2023. 5 Table of Contents Our working capital deficiency as of April 30, 2023 was 165,198 as compared to our working capital deficiency of 175,450 as of April 30, 2022. The decrease in working capital deficiency was mainly due to the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year ended April 30, 2023. Cash Flows Year Ended April 30, Changes 2023 2022 Amount Cash flows used in operating activities (47,580 (23,793 (23,787 100 Cash flows provided by financing activities 47,580 23,793 23,787 100 Net changes in cash - - - - Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 47,580 for the year ended April 30, 2023 compared with 23,793 used in operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2022.

During the year ended April 30, 2022, we received 2,500 through issuance of promissory note from an unaffiliated party and 21,293 from director s advancement. Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 6 Table of Contents Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. Going Concern The independent auditors report accompanying our April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 7A.

Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 1. We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 2. We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of April 30, 2023, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at April 30, 2023, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 22 Table of Contents PART III Item 10.
