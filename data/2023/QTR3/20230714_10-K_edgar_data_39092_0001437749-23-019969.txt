DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE 

Portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders of Friedman Industries, Incorporated for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 Part II.

PART I 

Item 1. Business 

General 

Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the Company ), a Texas corporation incorporated in 1965, is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two reportable segments: coil products and tubular products. Significant financial information relating to the Company s business segments for the last two years is contained in Note 13of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in Item 8 hereof.

Coil Products 

The coil product segment consists of the operation of five hot-rolled coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas; Decatur, Alabama; East Chicago, Indiana; Granite City, Illinois and Sinton, Texas. The facilities in Granite City and East Chicago were acquired on April 30, 2022 from Plateplus, Inc ("Plateplus"). More information about the Plateplus transaction can be found in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The facility in Sinton is a newly constructed facility that commenced operations during October 2022. The Hickman, Granite City and East Chicago facilities operate temper mills and cut-to-length lines. The Decatur and Sinton facilities operate stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines. The equipment at all locations improve the flatness and surface quality of the coils and cut the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. On a combined basis, the facilities are capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 16 gauge to 1 thick in widths ranging from 36 wide to 96 wide. The vast majority of the coil product segment's revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory but the segment also generates revenue from the processing or storage of customer owned coils on a fee basis.

The coil processing facilities are substantially similar with respect to products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at multiple facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. Coil products are sold on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail.

The coil segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.

Tubular Products 

The tubular product segment consists of the Company s Texas Tubular Products division TTP located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter OD size range of 2 3/8 OD to 8 5/8 OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute API licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. TTP has a pipe finishing facility capable of applying threads and couplings to oil country tubular goods and performing other services that are customary in the pipe finishing process. The pipe finishing facility is currently idled. All of the tubular segment's revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory. 

TTP purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: 
 
 Fiscal year 2023 was a historic year for Friedman Industries, Inc. (the Company ). The year started with the Company s first acquisition in history when we purchased two steel coil processing facilities in East Chicago, Indiana and Granite City, Illinois. The quality of the equipment and products produced at these facilities is great and we welcomed an excellent group of operations, commercial and administrative employees to the Friedman team as part of the acquisition. The facilities were immediately accretive to the Company s operating results and we expect the facilities to contribute meaningful value to the Company as we progress. In October 2022, our newly constructed facility in Sinton, Texas commenced operations. The Sinton facility takes our steel processing capabilities to the next level with one of the largest stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines in North America. As we continue to ramp up production at the Sinton facility, we remain excited by the potential for the facility. We concluded the year by capturing the most profitable year in Company history and more than doubling our annual sales volume. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 was another volatile year for hot-rolled coil HRC ). The year started with a sharp and abrupt increase in HRC price following the Russian invasion of Ukraine with prices reaching almost 1,500 per ton at the end of April 2022. From there, HRC prices declined approximately 60 until December 2022. From December 2022 to the end of fiscal 2023, HRC prices increased approximately 87 as domestic steel producers announced several rounds of price increases. I am proud of our team for navigating these challenging market conditions and maintaining profitability for each quarter of fiscal 2023 all while also integrating our newly acquired and newly constructed facilities into our overall business. 
 
 I have many memorable experiences during my 40 plus years in the steel industry but fiscal 2023 will stand out as a highlight. Our team successfully executed significant strategic initiatives which more than doubled the scale of our business. Through the process we gained valuable experience in identifying, evaluating and executing growth opportunities. Our desire is to leverage this experience as we seek additional growth opportunities with the goal of providing long-term value for the Company and its shareholders. 
 
 You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to start at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Wednesday, September 13, 2023, in the offices of Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP, 1301 McKinney, 51st Floor, Houston, Texas 77010.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
 Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the Company is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two product segments: coil products and tubular products. 
 
 Coil Products 
 
 The coil product segment consists of the operation of five hot-rolled coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas; Decatur, Alabama; East Chicago, Indiana; Granite City, Illinois and Sinton, Texas. The facilities in Granite City and East Chicago were acquired on April 30, 2022 from Plateplus, Inc ("Plateplus"). More information about the Plateplus transaction can be found in Note 2. The facility in Sinton is a newly constructed facility that commenced operations during October 2022. The Hickman, Granite City and East Chicago facilities operate temper mills and cut-to-length lines. The Decatur and Sinton facilities operate stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines. The equipment at all locations improve the flatness and surface quality of the coils and cut the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. On a combined basis, the facilities are capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 16 gauge to 1 thick in widths ranging from 36 wide to 96 wide. The vast majority of coil product segment revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory but the segment also generates revenue from the processing or storage of customer owned coils on a fee basis. 
 
 The coil processing facilities are substantially similar with respect to products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at multiple facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. Coil products are sold on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail. 
 
 The coil segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 
 The Company sells coil products and processing services to approximately 520 customers located primarily in the midwestern, southwestern and southeastern regions of the United States. The Company s principal customers for these products and services are steel distributors and customers manufacturing steel products such as steel buildings, railroad cars, barges, tanks and containers, trailers, component parts and other fabricated steel products. 
 
 Tubular Products 
 
 The tubular product segment consists of the Company s Texas Tubular Products division TTP located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter OD size range of 2 3/8 OD to 8 5/8 OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute API licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. TTP has a pipe finishing facility capable of applying threads and couplings to oil country tubular goods and performing other services that are customary in the pipe finishing process. The pipe finishing facility is currently idled. All of the tubular segment's revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory. 
 
 The Company sells its tubular products nationally to approximately 95 customers. The Company s principal customers for these products are steel and pipe distributors. 
 
 TTP purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 
 Significant financial information relating to the Company s two product groups, coil and tubular products, is contained i n Note 13 of the Notes to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing herein.

The Company s Common Stock is traded principally on the NYSE American (trading symbol FRD). 
 
 The approximate number of shareholders of record of Common Stock of the Company as of April 28, 2023 was 170.

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset s or asset group's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company did not identify any indicators of impairment during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022 . When property, plant and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reflected in income. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as assets held for sale. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

The Company paid income taxes of approximately million in fiscal 2023 and paid income taxes of approximately million, net of a tax refund of approximately million, in fiscal 2022 . At March 31, 2022, the "Construction in process" balance of approximately million consisted of million in accrued capital expenditures related to the Sinton facility for which cash outlay had not occurred. These cash outlays were made during fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023, the Company issued shares of common stock as part of the Plateplus business combination discussed in Note 2, resulting in non-cash investing activity of approximately million. During fiscal 2023, there was a non-cash transaction of approximately for the transfer of ownership of a life insurance policy maintained by the Company with respect to an officer from the Company to such officer upon his retirement.

and of total Company sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10 or more of total Company sales for either fiscal year. The Company s sales are concentrated primarily in the midwestern, southwestern, and southeastern regions of the United States and are primarily to customers in the steel distributing and fabricating industries. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of the financial conditions of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Generally, receivables are due within 30 days. 

million, of which million was cash consideration and million related to shares of the Company's common stock issued to the Seller. The fair value of the shares issued was determined based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on April 29, 2022, the last trading day prior to the Acquisition Date. At the Acquisition Date, the Transaction was funded with net borrowings of million made under the Company's asset-based lending facility ("ABL Facility") provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank. An additional million was funded by the ABL Facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 to pay the final net working capital adjustment. 
 
 The Transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with Topic 805, Business Combinations , whereby the consideration transferred and the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of these identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill. The Transaction resulted in residual goodwill.

Earnings from operations 

Our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2023 includes net sales of approximately million and earnings from operations of approximately million attributable to the East Chicago and Granite City facilities acquired from Plateplus. At the Acquisition Date, the Company acquired the inventory on hand at Plateplus' Houston and Loudon facilities and also assumed inventory on order related to these locations. Plateplus provided toll processing services for this material for a period of time following the Acquisition Date with these services having concluded by August 31, 2022. In addition to the East Chicago and Granite City sales and earnings from operations, our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2023 includes net sales of approximately million and earnings from operations of approximately million attributable to sales of inventory from Houston and Loudon where the fixed assets were not acquired. For fiscal 2023, the Company recorded transaction specific costs of approximately million as a component of "Selling, general and administrative" expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Information about the debt issuance costs associated with the acquisition financing is provided in Note 4. 

shares. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, select the employees, directors or consultants to whom awards will be granted and shall determine the amount and applicable restrictions of each award. Restricted awards entitle recipients to vote and receive non-forfeitable dividends during the restriction period. Because dividends are non-forfeitable, they are reflected in retained earnings. Forfeitures are accounted for upon their occurrence. Because the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, the non-forfeitable dividends are reclassified from retained earnings to additional stock compensation for the actual forfeitures that occurred.

On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the ABL Facility. The Second Amendment increased the revolving loans available under the ABL facility from an aggregate principal amount of up to million to an aggregate principal amount of up to million. On July 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the ABL Facility. The Third Amendment to the ABL Facility provided for the syndication of the asset-based revolving loans available thereunder with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. ("BMO") with JPMorgan Chase Bank serving as the arranging agent (the "Agent"). The Third Amendment also amended provisions of the ABL Facility authorizing the Agent to make protective advances under the ABL Facility and added a covenant requiring each of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain the Agent as its principal depository bank. In connection with the Third Amendment, the Company also entered into a Revolving Note payable to BMO in a principal amount of up to million establishing BMO as a one - third syndicated participant in the Company's ABL facility. The ABL Facility matures on May 19, 2026 and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company can elect borrowings on a floating rate basis or a term basis. Floating rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate minus per annum. Term rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate applicable to the selected term plus per annum. Availability of funds under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation determined as the sum of (a) of eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) the product of multiplied by the net orderly liquidating value percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by eligible inventory. The ABL Facility contains a springing financial covenant whereby the financial covenant is only tested when availability falls below the greater of of the revolving commitment or million. The financial covenant restricts the Company from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to be, as of the end of any calendar month, less than to 1.00 for the trailing twelve -month period then ending. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (a) EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, minus unfinanced capital expenditures to (b) cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus taxes paid in cash plus restricted payments paid in cash plus capital lease obligation payments plus cash contributions to any employee pension benefit plans. The ABL Facility contains other representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary. If certain conditions precedent are satisfied, the ABL facility may be increased by up to an aggregate of million, in minimum increments of million. At March 31, 2023, the Company had a balance of approximately million under the ABL Facility with an applicable interest rate of . At March 31, 2023, the Company's applicable borrowing base calculation supported access to approximately million of the ABL Facility. 
 
 The Company incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million in connection with the Second Amendment to the ABL Facility and approximately million in connection with the Third Amendment to the ABL Facility. The Company recorded these debt issuance costs as non-current other assets and will amortize these costs on an equal monthly basis over the remaining term of the ABL facility.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Friedman Industries, Incorporated 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Friedman Industries, Incorporated and subsidiary (the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of March 31, 2023, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as discussed in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting provided below. 
 
 Notwithstanding the material weaknesses described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein. 
 
 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as is defined in the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at March 31, 2023 because of the material weaknesses described below. 
 
 Based on the COSO criteria, management identified control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses were identified: 
 
 Material weaknesses related to financial closing and reporting process 
 
 During its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that the Company did not design and implement appropriate control activities necessary to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements. In certain cases, controls were designed and implemented late in the fiscal year, thus did not have sufficient time to evidence their operating effectiveness. Certain management review controls were not designed to operate at an appropriate level of precision to detect potential material errors. In addition, for certain controls, segregation of duties was not adequate. For a number of controls, documentation of completeness and accuracy of key reports was not adequately maintained as well as support for evidence of performance was insufficient. Management also identified instances of certain controls missing that would be necessary to address risks of material misstatement in some transaction cycles. 
 
 Plan for Remediation 
 
 In the prior year, the Company identified that the number of accounting personnel and the limited utilization of information technology in its control structure were the primary contributing factors to the material weaknesses identified. The Company hired additional personnel during fiscal 2023 and believes it is adequately staffed to execute the remediation plans developed by management. The previously identified material weaknesses have not been remediated due to ongoing post-acquisition integration during fiscal 2023. The operation of the full business in a new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system is the most significant piece of this integration. All of the Company's coil segment locations were integrated into the new ERP system as of February 2023. The Company's tubular segment is expected to go live under the new ERP system during the second quarter of fiscal year March 31, 2024. The Company expects the new ERP system to allow for many of the Company s current manual controls and missing controls to be performed by the design and capabilities of the ERP system rather than relying on manual human execution. With most of the post-acquisition integration completed, the Company expects its additional personnel will be able to dedicate the necessary time during fiscal 2024 to improve the design, documentation and execution of internal controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Except for the matters discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 
 
 Friedman Industries, Incorporated is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two reportable segments: coil products and tubular products. 
 
 The coil product segment consists of the operation of five hot-rolled coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas; Decatur, Alabama; East Chicago, Indiana; Granite City, Illinois and Sinton, Texas. The facilities in Granite City and East Chicago were acquired on April 30, 2022 from Plateplus, Inc ("Plateplus"). More information about the Plateplus transaction can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The facility in Sinton is a newly constructed facility that commenced operations during October 2022. The Hickman, Granite City and East Chicago facilities operate temper mills and cut-to-length lines. The Decatur and Sinton facilities operate stretcher leveler cut-to-length lines. The equipment at all locations improve the flatness and surface quality of the coils and cut the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. On a combined basis, the facilities are capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 16 gauge to 1 thick in widths ranging from 36 wide to 96 wide. The vast majority of coil product segment revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory but the segment also generates revenue from the processing or storage of customer owned coils on a fee basis. 
 
 The tubular product segment consists of the Company s Texas Tubular Products division TTP located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter OD size range of 2 3/8 OD to 8 5/8 OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute API licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. TTP has a pipe finishing facility capable of applying threads and couplings to oil country tubular goods and performing other services that are customary in the pipe finishing process. The pipe finishing facility is currently idled. All of the tubular segment's revenue is generated from sales of Company owned inventory. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Year ended March 31, 2023 compared to year ended March 31, 2022 
 
 During the year ended March 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), sales, costs of goods sold and gross profit increased approximately 262.3 million, 260.2 million and 2.1 million, respectively, from the comparable amounts recorded during the year ended March 31, 2022 fiscal 2022 ). The increase in sales was primarily related to an increase in sales volume. Sales volume increased from approximately 200,000 tons in fiscal 2022 to approximately 467,000 tons in fiscal 2023. The acquisition of facilities and inventory from Plateplus, Inc. in April 2022 and the Company's newly constructed facility in Sinton, TX commencing operations in October 2022 account for approximately 265,000 tons of the fiscal 2023 sales volume. Discussion of the changes in sales volume and average selling price is expanded upon at the segment level in the following paragraphs. Gross profit increased from approximately 41.0 million for fiscal 2022 to approximately 43.1 million for fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from approximately 14.4 in fiscal 2022 to approximately 7.9 in fiscal 2023. Gross profit for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 included recognized losses related to hedging activities designated for hedge accounting of approximately 4.1 million and 21.1 million, respectively. Excluding these recognized hedging losses, gross profit related to physical material as a percentage of sales was approximately 8.6 for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 19.6 for fiscal 2022. 
 
 Our operating results are significantly impacted by the market price of hot-rolled steel coil ("HRC"). The Company experienced significant volatility in steel price during both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. HRC prices were on a historic rise entering fiscal 2022 that continued until reaching an all-time high of approximately 1,950 per ton at the end of August 2021. From September 2021 to February 2022, HRC prices declined approximately 52 until the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sharp and abrupt increase. HRC prices increased approximately 60 from the beginning of March 2022 to the end of April 2022 and then declined approximately 60 until the middle of December 2022. From December 2022 to the end of fiscal 2023, HRC prices increased approximately 87 . For fiscal 2022, these circumstances created record margins for the first half of the year followed by margin compression for the second half of they year. However, with the margin compression starting from a historic margin level, fiscal 2022 is characterized overall as a period of very strong margins. For fiscal 2023, these circumstance created strong margins for the first fiscal quarter followed by compressed margins until the fourth fiscal quarter when margins began improving. Fiscal 2023 is characterized overall as a period of modest margins. The Company has attained its most profitable fiscal year for two years in a row with net earnings for fiscal 2023 of approximately 21.3 million and net earnings for fiscal 2022 of approximately 14.1 million. 

27

Coil Segment 
 
 Coil product segment sales for fiscal 2023 totaled approximately 485.6 million compared to approximately 230.4 million for fiscal 2022. For a more complete understanding of the average selling prices of goods sold, it is helpful to exclude any hedging related gains or losses that are captured in sales and any sales generated from processing of customer owned material. Coil segment sales for fiscal 2023 were reduced by approximately 4.1 million for the recognition of hedging related losses. Coil segment sales for fiscal 2022 were reduced by approximately 28.4 million for the recognition of hedging related losses. Sales generated from processing or storage of customer owned material totaled approximately 2.8 million for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 1.4 million for fiscal 2022. Sales generated from coil segment inventory, excluding the impact of any hedging related gains or losses, totaled approximately 486.9 million for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 257.4 million for fiscal 2022. The average per ton selling price related to these shipments decreased from approximately 1,693 per ton in fiscal 2022 to approximately 1,131 per ton in fiscal 2023. Inventory tons sold increased from approximately 152,000 tons in fiscal 2022 to approximately 430,500 tons in fiscal 2023. The significant increase in sales volume was primarily attributable to the facilities and inventory acquired from Plateplus and the startup of the new Sinton facility which combined account for approximately 265,000 tons of the 430,500 tons sold in fiscal 2023. Coil segment operations recorded operating profits of approximately 23.4 million and 31.8 million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Operating profit for fiscal 2023 includes recognized net losses on hedging activities of approximately 4.1 million while fiscal 2022 operating profit included recognized net losses on hedging activities of approximately 18.0 million. 
 
 The Company s coil segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. 
 
 Tubular Segment 
 
 Tubular product segment sales for fiscal 2023 totaled approximately 61.9 million compared to approximately 54.8 million for fiscal 2022. Sales increased due to an increase in the average selling price per ton, partially offset by a decline in the volume sold. For a more complete understanding of the average selling prices of goods sold, it is helpful to exclude any hedging related gains or losses that are captured in sales. Tubular segment sales for fiscal 2023 were not impacted by any hedging related gains or losses. Tubular segment sales for fiscal 2022 were reduced by approximately 3.3 million for the recognition of hedging related losses. Sales generated from tubular segment inventory, excluding the impact of any hedging related gains or losses, totaled approximated 61.9 million for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 58.1 million for fiscal 2022. The average per ton selling price related to these shipments increased from approximately 1,221 per ton for fiscal 2022 to approximately 1,700 per ton for fiscal 2023. Tons sold decreased from approximately 47,500 tons in fiscal 2022 to approximately 36,500 tons in fiscal 2023. The decline in sales volume was primarily related to a decline in mill reject pipe sales partially offset by an increase in manufactured pipe sales. U.S. Steel's Lone Star Tubular Operations was the Company's sole source of supply for mill reject pipe. With U.S. Steel's idling of their Lone Star Operations, the Company's receipts of mill reject pipe ceased in August 2020 and the inventory balance started to decline steadily each quarter. The Company sold out of mill reject pipe during fiscal 2023. Mill reject pipe sales volume was approximately 1,000 tons for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 21,500 tons for fiscal 2022. Manufactured pipe sales volume was approximately 35,500 tons for fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 26,000 tons for fiscal 2022. The average selling price increase was also primarily related to this shift in sales mix between manufactured pipe and mill reject pipe. The selling price associated with manufactured pipe is typically much higher than the selling price associated with mill reject pipe. The Company will continue to focus on the expansion of its manufactured pipe operations to counteract the impact of mill reject pipe sales ending. Tubular segment operations recorded operating profits of approximately 8.6 million and 2.4 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating profit for fiscal 2023 was not impacted by any hedging related gains or losses while fiscal 2022 operating profit included net recognized losses on hedging activities of approximately 3.1 million. 
 
 The tubular segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.

Selling, General and Administrative Costs 
 
 During fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative costs increased approximately 9.5 million compared to fiscal 2022. This increase is primarily associated with costs associated with the Plateplus transaction and increased personnel. Cost for fiscal 2023 includes approximately 1.2 million of one-time expenses related to the Plateplus transaction. Cost for fiscal 2023 includes approximately 3.4 million of general, selling and administrative costs associated with the East Chicago and Granite City locations acquired from Plateplus, approximately 0.4 million associated with the new Sinton facility and approximately 2.6 million in personnel costs for additional sales, accounting, IT and corporate employees hired during fiscal 2023. The remaining increase is associated with the significant increase in the scale of our business during fiscal 2023 which caused increased expenses in a variety of selling, general and administrative areas. 
 
 Other Income 
 
 For fiscal 2022, the Company reported other income of approximately 1.7 million which consists primarily of a gain of approximately 1.7 million associated with the forgiveness of the Company's Paycheck Protection Program loan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes increased from a provision for fiscal 2022 of approximately 4.3 million to a provision for fiscal 2023 of approximately 6.8 million. This increase was related primarily to the increased earnings before tax for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL 
 
 The Company's current ratio was 3.2 and 2.1 at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Working capital was approximately 98.6 million at March 31, 2023 and 64.6 million at March 31, 2022. 
 
 During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company maintained assets and liabilities at levels it believed were commensurate with operations. Changes in balance sheet amounts occurred in the ordinary course of business and due to the transaction with Plateplus described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounts receivable and inventories increased significantly due primarily to the Plateplus transaction. Cash and restricted cash decreased primarily due to the Plateplus acquisition investing activities partially offset by cash generated from the Company's operating activities and by cash provided from the Company's credit facility. The Company expects to continue to monitor, evaluate and manage balance sheet components depending on changes in market conditions and the Company s operations. 
 
 In June 2021, the Small Business Administration authorized full forgiveness of the Company's Paycheck Protection Program loan. 
 
 On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to its asset-based lending facility ("ABL Facility") provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Second Amendment increased the revolving loans available under the ABL facility from an aggregate principal amount of up to 75 million to an aggregate principal amount of up to 150 million. The ABL Facility matures on May 19, 2026 and is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The Company can elect borrowings on a floating rate basis or a term basis. Floating rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate minus 1 per annum. Term rate borrowings accrue interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate applicable to the selected term plus 1.8 per annum. Availability of funds under the ABL Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation determined as the sum of (a) 90 of eligible accounts receivable, plus (b) the product of 85 multiplied by the net orderly liquidating value percentage identified in the most recent inventory appraisal multiplied by eligible inventory. The ABL Facility contains a springing financial covenant whereby the financial covenant is only tested when availability falls below the greater of 15 of the revolving commitment or 22.5 million. The financial covenant restricts the Company from allowing its fixed charge coverage ratio to be, as of the end of any calendar month, less than 1.10 to 1.00 for the trailing twelve month period then ending. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (a) EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility, minus unfinanced capital expenditures to (b) cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments on indebtedness plus taxes paid in cash plus restricted payments paid in cash plus capital lease obligation payments plus cash contributions to any employee pension benefit plans. The ABL Facility contains other representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that are usual and customary. If certain conditions precedent are satisfied, the ABL facility may be increased by up to an aggregate of 25 million, in minimum increments of 5 million. On July 6, 2022, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the ABL Facility. The Third Amendment to the ABL Facility provides for the syndication of the asset based revolving loans available thereunder with BMO Harris Bank, N.A. ("BMO") with JPMorgan Chase Bank serving as the arranging agent (the "Agent"). The Third Amendment also amends provisions of the ABL Facility authorizing the Agent to make protective advances under the ABL Facility and adds a covenant requiring each of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain the Agent as its principal depository bank. In connection with the Third Amendment, the Company also entered into a Revolving Note payable to BMO in a principal amount of up to 50 million establishing BMO as a one-third syndicated participant in the Company's ABL facility. At March 31, 2023, the Company had a balance of approximately 33.1 million under the ABL Facility with an applicable interest rate of 7.0 . At March 31, 2023, the Company's applicable borrowing base calculation supported access to approximately 94.2 million of the ABL Facility. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, the Company had borrowings of approximately 32.5 million outstanding under the ABL Facility and the Company's most recent borrowing base calculation provided access to approximately 111.0 million of the ABL Facility. 
 
 The Company believes that its current cash position along with cash flows from operations and borrowing capability due to its financial position are adequate to fund its expected cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 
 DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS 
 
 From time to time, the Company may use futures contracts to partially manage exposure to commodity price risk. The Company elects hedge accounting for some of its derivatives and classifies the transactions as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. The Company may also transact futures contracts as economic hedges of risk where hedge accounting is not elected. For fiscal 2023, the Company recognized net losses of approximately 4.1 million related to derivatives designated for hedge accounting and classified as cash flow hedges and recognized net gains of approximately 9.3 million related to economic hedges of risk. For fiscal 2022, the Company recognized net losses of approximately 21.1 million related to derivatives designated for hedge accounting and classified as cash flow hedges and recognized losses of approximately 11.6 million related to economic hedges of risk. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the Company's derivative financial instruments. 

29

OUTLOOK 
 
 The Company expects sales volume for its first quarter of fiscal 2024 to be approximately the same as sales volume for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company expects margin improvement for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the rising hot-rolled coil prices entering the first quarter. Overall, the Company expects the first quarter to be one of the more profitable quarters in Company history. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 
 The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 INFLATION 
 
 During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company believes that the general level of inflation did not have a material effect on the Company's operations. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant estimates and judgements for the Company include determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination discussed in Note 2. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant judgments and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 From time to time, the Company may make certain statements that contain forward-looking information (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996, as amended) and that involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements may include those risks disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report.

The figures for fiscal years 2014 to 2017 have not been adjusted for a change in accounting principle where the Company changed its valuation method for prime coil inventory from the LIFO method to the average cost method. The change in accounting principle was effective for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 figures were adjusted to meet comparative financial statement reporting requirements. The impact of the change in accounting principle on fiscal years 2014 to 2017 has not been quantified by the Company and could be material, therefore, the figures may not be comparable to fiscal years 2018 to 2023.
