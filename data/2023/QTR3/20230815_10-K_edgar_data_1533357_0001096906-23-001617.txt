PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 Defense Technologies International Corp. (the Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998. Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name from Canyon Gold Corp. to Defense Technologies International Corp. to represent the Company s expansion goals more fully into the advanced technology sector. 
 
 Our principal executive office is located at 2683 Via De La Ville Suite G418, Del Mar CA 92014 147, telephone (1-800) 520-9485. Additional office space is subleased from EMAC at 641 West 3rd Street, North Vancouver BC, Canada. 
 
 Our website address is http://www.defensetechnologiesintl.com. 
 
 Development of Scanner Technology Business 
 
 Defense Technologies International Corp. s (the Company subsidiary PSSI acquired the world-wide exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan a next generation, walk-through personnel scanning system. The Passive Portal a patented product (US Patent: 7408461) is an advanced passive scanning technology for detection and identifying concealed threats to be used for the security of schools and other public venues. 
 
 Our research shows The Passive Portal as the only known Walk-Through Scanner in today s market that is based on PASSIVE SENSING ZER0-RATION and is therefore totally harmless to the subject being scanned. All other Walk-Through Scanners in the market are based on ACTIVE SCANNING with radiation and therefore can be harmful over time. 
 
 PSSI has the exclusive World-Wide license to manufacture and sell the Passive Scanning Technology . We added a Camera for the detection of Elevated Body Temperatures (EBT), our first products are: 
 Passive Portal , Passive Portal EBT, Passive EBT Station 
 
 On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC CCS ), representing the inventor of the technology and assets that include d a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement. Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements. The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016, until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued. 
 
 The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of 25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties at the end of each six-month period at the rate of the greater of 5 of gross sales used or sold, or the minimum royalty payment of 25,000. The Company also agreed to compensate investors that have provided funding for the development of CCS's technology with 5 shares of the Company's common stock. Additionally, CCS will be entitled to receive 1 shares of the Company's common stock upon completed sales of 1,000 passive scanner units based on the CCS technology. On December 14, 2017, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series B preferred stock to Controlled Capture Systems, LLC to extend the exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan to March 15, 2018. 
 
 On May 30, 2018, the Company and Control Capture Systems, LLC amended their license agreement as follows: 
 1. Royalty payments of 5 of gross sale from the license agreement will be calculated and paid quarterly with a minimum of 12,500 paid each quarter. 
 2. All payment will be in US dollars or stock of the Company and or its subsidiary. The value of the stock will be a discount to market of 25 of the average trading price for the 10 days prior to conversion. The number of shares received by Control Capture prior to any reverse split are anti-dilutive. 
 3. Invoices for parts and materials will be billed separately of the license fees noted above. 
 4 
 
 The Company capitalized the costs to acquire the License Agreement, including the 25,000 initial licensing fee and the estimated value of 353,600 of the 5shares of the Company's common stock issued on November 10, 2016, to the CCS investors, which value was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Definitive Agreement. The Company recorded a current liability of 36,000 for the remaining obligation in its consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2019. Once sales of products based on the CCS technology begin, the Company will amortize the capitalized costs over the estimated life of the license agreement as determined by the legal life of patents issued. To date we have sold 10 units to two distributors. The Company reviewed the valuation of the license agreement and determined to impair the asset of 378,600. 
 
 Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. PSSI was incorporated in the state of Utah as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company merged its wholly owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. Long Canyon ), into PSSI, with PSSI the surviving entity. The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company currently owns 76.28 of PSSI with 23.72 acquired by several individuals and entities. With the merger of Long Canyon into PSSI, the Company discontinued its mineral exploration business. The Company concluded the initial development of the technology and will proceed to put the system through the required Beta Test at a high school near Austin Tx. All sales and marketing activities will be executed through PSSI. 
 
 The security products licensed from CCS as developed by the Company are designed for personal and collateral protection. The proposed detection technology is intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities. The units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject. The Company, in consultation with CCS, recently completed a prototype with optional Digital Imaging which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter. The prototype scanner unit has successfully passed elaborate lab testing and is ready for deployment and demonstration. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We believe we have the only known passive scanner technology based on earth magnetic technology that is Radiation Free and does not cause any harm to the subject passing through the scanner. Our scanners are PASSIVE SENSING and are therefore uniquely suited for school systems and other public venues. Our competitors technology is ACTIVE SENSING based on X-Ray, microwave or radio signals, all of which are harmful over time. We believe this provides an advantage for our scanners over those developed by our competition. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 On November 04, 2020, we engaged the services of Jonathan Silver of Cumulus Media Inc of Atlanta GA to assist DTII in Investors Relations and Marketing of its Passive Portal and EBT Station. 
 
 Through our National Marketing Director. Mr. Jonathan Silver, we have made contact with schools, synagogues as well as other venue holders that have expressed interest in having the Passive Security Scan Unit presented at the school for demonstration and evaluation. Furthermore, as funding permits, we plan to install a demonstration unit in every state free of charge via the state s Governor s Office. We expect major exposure through this program. 
 
 Jonathan Silver arranged the installation of Demo-Units of the Passive Portal and the EBT Camera (elevated body temperature) at the Coastal Carolina University, Convey SC; Florence County Sheriff s Detention Center, Effingham, SC; Myrtle Beach Police Department Detention Center, Myrtle Beach, SC. 
 
 We have signed three Distributorship Agreements. A distributor will get from 20 to 28.5 discount on Gross Sales but is required to purchase a minimum of 10 units at time of signing for a distributorship. General referrals will earn a 10 discount. 
 
 With the completion of requisite funding, we expect to place the first units during the fall of 2021 and commence a major marketing campaign at the same time. We believe that we will start production and sales within the coming three to six months. 
 
 5 
 
 With the start of initial sales, we believe that we will be able to raise major funding through more conventional sources for our production. 
 
 Production 
 
 We acquired the necessary machinery and equipment to manufacture and assemble up to 500 Passive Portals per month at our new Dallas Tx production facility. 
 
 To date we have manufactured and assembled 35 Passive Portal Units and ten EBT Stations the first thirteen units which will mainly be used for demonstrations and donations to valuable future customers. 
 
 In addition, we have all parts for an additional twenty-five Passive Portals at our plant in Dallas , TX 
 
 We installed three Passive Portals and three EBT Stations in S.C. which are working without any flaws as engineered and required by its technology and as endorsed by the end-users. 

Trademarks and Copyrights 
 
 We acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements. The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016, until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued. CCS currently owns 3 patents and 2 patents pending related to the technology. 

Employees 
 
 We presently have five full and part-time Consultants and do not anticipate adding additional employees until our business operations and financial resources so warrant. The Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company and CCS provides that CCS will provide support for the development of the security technology and products. The management of our Company is provided through a series of service agreements with our officers and directors and key consultants. 
 
 Facilities 
 
 We presently rent office facilities at 2683 Via De La Ville Suite G418, Del Mar CA 92014 that serve as our principal executive offices. Additional office space is subleased from EMAC at 641 West 3rd Street, North Vancouver BC, Canada.

 Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will should, expect, intend, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, continue, or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern. Through April 30, 2023, the Company had no revenue, has an accumulated deficit of 16,527,130 and a working capital deficit of 1,919,651 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2023 by issuing debt 
 9 
 
 and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company s business operations. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 We currently have a limited source of operating revenues. Accordingly, zero revenue was recorded in the year ended April 30, 2023 and in the same period in 2022. 
 
 Our total operating expenses increased to 1,734,114 in the year ended April 30, 2023 from 867,597 in the year ended April 30, 2022. The increases are due primarily to a higher development expenses and consulting fees. 
 
 Our interest expense decreased to 163,643 in the year ended April 30, 2023 from 203,388 in the year ended April 30, 2022. In addition, our loss on extinguishment of debt was 849,329, in the year ended April 30, 2023 compared to 36,682 in the same time in 2022. 
 
 We recognized a decrease on derivative liability to 65,826 compared to 305,232 in the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We estimate the fair value of the derivative for the conversion feature of our convertible notes payable using the American Option Binomial pricing model at the inception of the debt, at the date of conversions to equity, cash payments and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount and a gain or loss on change in derivative liability as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective loan agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability and associated gain or loss on derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material. 
 
 We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 849,329 in the year ended April 30, 2023 compared to 36,682 in the year ended April 30, 2022. The change on extinguishment of debt resulted primarily from the elimination of derivative liabilities upon debt extinguishment. This will fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of debt conversions and the associated balance of derivative liabilities, and the fluctuation may be material. 
 
 As a result, we recognized a net loss of 2,627,563 and net loss of 718,325 on the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Because we own 76.28 of PSSI as of April 30, 2023 we include 76.28 of the net loss of PSSI for the year ended April 30, 2023 in our consolidated net loss and have reported non-controlling interest of 23.72 of the net loss of PSSI, or 51,923, for the year ended April 30, 2023 and 42,701 for the same period in 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At April 30, 2023, we had total current assets of 35,316, consisting of cash of 804 and inventory of 34,512. Current liabilities at April 30, 2023 were 1,954,967 resulting in a working capital deficit of 1,919,651. Included in our current liabilities and working capital deficit are payables to related parties of 910,534, notes payable of 179,692, accounts payable of 260,766 and derivative liabilities totaling 65,826 related to the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable. We do not believe the derivative liabilities will require settlement in cash. 
 
 A significant portion of our current liabilities as of April 30, 2023 is comprised of amounts due to related parties of 910,524 compared to 1,554,639 for the same period in 2022. We anticipate that in the short-term, operating funds will continue to be provided by related parties and other lenders. 
 
 At April 30, 2023, we had total convertible notes payable of 319,767, net of discount. Several of the note agreements require repayment through conversion of principal and interest into shares of the Company's common stock. We anticipate, therefore, converting these notes payable into shares of our 
 10 
 
 common stock without the need for replacement financing; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing this. 
 
 Pursuant to notes payable and convertible notes payable, we received total cash proceeds of 115,600 in notes payable and repaid 10,950 for net cash of 104,650 for the year ended April 30, 2023. We received 75,000, less payment of notes payable of 5,733 and the sale of preferred shares of 177,500 or a net cash received from financing activities of 246,767 during the year ended April 30, 2022. These convertible short-term notes, which have a total principal balance of 305,127, net of discount at April 30, 2022, bear interest at annual rates ranging from 6 to 15 per annum and are convertible into common shares of the Company upon the terms and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the note agreements. The notes generally contain early repayment penalties if repaid before defined payment dates in the note agreements. 
 
 During the year ended April 30, 2022 we extinguished 132,728 in principal and accrued interest through conversion of convertible notes payable to common stock. 
 
 During the year ended April 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 109,607 as a result of our net loss of 2,545,332 offset an increase in payables to related parties of 430,135, a change in accounts payable of 956,351, stocks for service of 294,998 and loss on stock issuance of 849,329 
 
 During the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 285,215 as a result of our net loss of 718,325 offset by amortization of debt discount and financing costs of 96,610, change in fair value of 492,187, increase in related party payables to 304,821, and accounts payable and accrued expense of 700,921. 
 
 During the year ended April 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 104,950 comprised of net proceeds from notes payable of 115,600 offset by repayment of notes payable of 10,950. 
 
 During the year ended April 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 246,767 comprised of net proceeds from convertible notes payable of 75,000, repayment of notes payable of 5,733 and the sale of preferred shares of 177,500 
 
 We have not realized any significant revenues since inception and paid expenses and costs with proceeds from the issuance of securities as well as by loans from investor, stockholders, and other related parties. 
 
 Our immediate goal is to provide funding for the completion of the initial production of the Offender Alert Passive Scan licensed from CCS. The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats. 
 
 We believe a related party and other lenders will provide sufficient funds to carry on general operations in the near term and fund PSSI s production and sales. We expect to raise additional funds from the sale of securities, stockholder loans and convertible debt. However, we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain financing to carry out our business plan. 
 
 As of April 30, 2023, we did not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 In the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations until such time as we begin to realize revenues from operations. At that time, management will evaluate the possible effects of inflation related to our business and operations following a successful acquisition or merger. 
 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforward 
 
 We have accumulated a net operating loss carryforward of approximately 7,554,918 as of April 30, 2023. This loss carry forward may be offset against future taxable income. The use of these losses to reduce future income taxes will depend on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforward. In the event of certain changes in control, there will be an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforward that can be used. No tax benefit has been 
 11 
 
 reported in the financial statements for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 because it has been fully offset by a valuation reserve. The use of future tax benefit is undeterminable because we presently have no operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to intangible assets, derivative liabilities, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 For further information on our significant accounting policies see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. There were no changes to our significant accounting policies during the year ended April 30, 2023. The following is a description of those significant accounting policies that involve estimates and judgment by management. 
 
 Derivative Liabilities 
 
 We have identified the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable as derivatives. We estimate the fair value of the derivatives using American Option Binomial pricing model. We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 
 
 Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share 
 
 The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted loss per share EPS on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive common shares if their effect is antidilutive. 
 
 Financial Instruments 
 
 Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value using a hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence when measuring fair value using a hierarch based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization with the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
 12 
 
 Level 1: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 2: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
 
 Level 3: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
 
 As of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company believes the amounts reported for cash, payables, accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the nature or duration of these instruments. 
 
 Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were estimated as follows at April 30, 2023 and 2022:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. As of April 30, 2019 the Company impaired the license agreement expensing 378,600. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 For purposes of this section, the term disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have not made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of April 30, 2023, and there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We lack full time personnel in accounting and financial staff to sufficiently monitor and process financial transactions in an efficient and timely manner. This allows for insufficient 
 14 
 
 segregation of duties and a lack of multiple levels of supervision and review. Our history of losses has severely limited our budget to hire and train enough accounting and financial personnel needed to adequately provide this function. Consequently, we lacked sufficient technical expertise, reporting standards and written policies and procedures. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Defense Technologies International Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Defense Technologies International Corp. the Company as of April 30, 2023, and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023, and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has had no revenue, an accumulated deficit, and working capital deficiency. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 F-2 
 
 Accounting for Embedded Conversion Features on Notes Payable 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has issued and outstanding several notes payable during the year with conversion rates that are adjustable at a discounted rate to market prices. The terms allow for variable amounts of shares to be converted for a set dollar value; this and other factors require the embedded conversion feature to be bifurcated and evaluated at each reporting period. Calculations and accounting for the notes payable and embedded conversion features require management s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition of the debt and related conversion features, use of a valuation model, and determination of appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to evaluating the Company s accounting for notes payable and related accounts included the following, among others: 
 Confirmation of notes payable and related terms. 
 Independent assessment of the appropriate valuation model for derivatives, performing independent calculations based on the model and comparing the Company s results to a reasonable range as determined during the audit. 
 Testing of substantially all transactions related to this matter. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2017.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Years Ended April 30, 2023 and 2022 

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 
 Defense Technologies International Corp. (the Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998. Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name to Defense Technologies International Corp. from Canyon Gold Corp. to represent the Company s expansion goals more fully into the advanced technology sector. 
 
 Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. PSSI was incorporated in the state of Utah as subsidiary controlled by the Company. The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company. The Company currently owns 76.28 of PSSI with 23.72 acquired by four individuals and entities. The Company plans to continue the development of the technology and conduct all sales and marketing activities in PSSI. 
 
 On January 19, 2018, the Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the shareholders, passed a resolution to affect a reverse split of the Company s outstanding common stock on a 1 share for 1,500 shares (1:1500) basis. The reverse split was effective on March 20, 2018. The number of shares in the financials are reflective of the reverse split. 
 
 On June 28, 2022, the Company received approval for a reverse split of its common shares of 1:500. As a result of the reverse split all common shares in the 10-K are restated with the number of shares effected by the reverse. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern. Through April 30, 2023, the Company had no revenue, has accumulated deficit of 16,527,130 and a working capital deficit of 1,919,652 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to provide for the Company's capital needs during the year ending April 30, 2023 by issuing debt and equity securities and by the continued support of its related parties. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company s business operations.

Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2021 and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its financial statements. 
 
 Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Consolidation and Non-Controlling Interest 
 
 These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Long Canyon, through January 15, 2017, and its majority-owned subsidiary, PSSI, from its formation on January 15, 2017. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
 
 The non-controlling interest in PSSI, representing 10,883 common shares, or 23,72 , was acquired by several individuals and entities, including related parties, in exchange for services valued at 6,100 and the extinguishment of Company accounts payable related parties with a book value of 9,835. 
 
 Reclassification 
 
 The Company is reclassing the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended April 30, 2022, due to a reclassification of series D preferred from mezzanine equity to equity. Initially, the 600 shares of series D preferred were presented in mezzanine equity. The reclassification reduces the mezzanine equity from 600,000 to zero and increase paid in capital to 600,000. Although the series D preferred were in the settlement of convertible notes, and the convertible into common stock, the conversion feature is not set and at the election of the board of directors. The Company also reclassed series A preferred shares increasing the preferred A shares by 59 reducing paid in capital by the same amount. The impact of the reclassification effect only balance sheet presented as of April 30, 2022. 
 
 Impairment of Inventory 
 
 The Company reviews the carrying value of its assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the asset by comparing the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the asset. The Company determined although their inventory is salable, none has been sold for over 2 years, but there is a potential of obsolescence to the asset. This could occur due to refinement of the finished product or enhancement of the parts used in the product. The Company has determined that some impairment has occurred and is reserving an impairment. As of April 30, 2023, the Company reserved 40,586 as an impairment of the value of the inventory. 
 
 Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share 
 
 The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share , which requires presentation of both basic and diluted loss per share EPS on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect 
 F-9 
 
 to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method, convertible preferred stock, and convertible debt, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive common shares if their effect is antidilutive. 
 
 As of April 30, 2023, convertible debt and related accrued interest payable plus conversion of A, B and D preferred shares are convertible into 49,194,638 shares of the Company s common stock. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
 
 Financial Instruments 
 
 Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value using a hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence when measuring fair value using a hierarch based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization with the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
 
 Level 1: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 2: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
 
 Level 3: applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
 
 As of April 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company believes the amounts reported for cash, payables, accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties approximate their fair values due to the nature or duration of these instruments.

Derivative Liabilities 
 
 We have identified the conversion features of certain of our convertible notes payable as derivatives. We estimate the fair value of the derivatives using the Black-Scholes pricing model. We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable. These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility and variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements. These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 
 
 Non-Monetary Transactions 
 
 All issuances of the Company s common stock for non-cash consideration have been assigned a dollar amount equaling either the market value of the shares issued, or the value of consideration received whichever is more readily determinable. The majority of the non-cash consideration received pertains to services rendered by consultants and others and has been valued at the market value of the shares issued. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees and consultants in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Stock-based compensation to employees is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payments using the Black Scholes option-pricing model for common stock options and warrants and the closing price of the Company s common stock for common share issuances. 
 
 C ash and Cash Equivalents 
 
 The Company considers all investments purchased with original maturity of three or fewer months to be cash equivalents. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventories are stated at the lower or cost of market using the first-in; first-out (FIFO) cost method of accounting. The inventory consists of raw materials used to make products, work in progress of zero and finished goods for sale with a total value of inventory after impairment of 34,512.

Equipment 
 Equipment is carried at the cost of acquisition and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets which is 36 months. Costs associated with repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Costs associated with improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the efficiency of our property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets

The issuance of warrants increased by 133,213. The down round calculation on the warrants did not trigger an amount greater than the down round calculated in earlier quarters. As part of the changes, the warrants expiration dates were extended to October 30, 2023 and February 27, 2024. 
 
 On April 29, 2022, the Company issued 600 series D preferred shares with a value of 600,000 to Ionic Ventures in exchange for the convertible debt interest and the cancellation of all warrants outstanding. As of April 30, 2022 there were zero warrants outstanding.
