statements give the Company s current expectations, plans, objectives, assumptions or forecasts of future events. All statements
other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this annual report, including statements regarding the Company s
future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations,
are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as anticipate, 
 estimate, plans, potential, projects, ongoing, expects, 
 management believes, we believe, we intend, and similar expressions. These statements are based
on the Company s current plans and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and as such the Company s actual future activities
and results of operations may be materially different from those set forth in the forward looking statements. Any or all of the forward-looking
statements in this annual report may turn out to be inaccurate and as such, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about
future events and financial trends that it believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and
financial needs. The forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties
and assumptions due to a number of factors, including:

 Need for
any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business. 

 The
US Food and Drug Administration FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or
biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of
the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated
as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics. 

 Our
domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals,
an Investigational New Drug Application IND must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive
clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal
use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. 

 Phase
I 

 Phase
1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These
trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the
drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called
dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction
of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances
when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. 

 Phase
II 

 Phase
II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group
of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups. 

 Phase
III 

 Phase
III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment
and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) label expansion 
(to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing
or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product. 

13 

On
occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance)
and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare
or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical
trials. 

 All
phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board IRB ). The IRB will consider,
among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense
required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create
the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application NDA or Biologic License Application BLA or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict
the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval. 

 Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval
for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products
during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in
FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible use. 

 The
FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced
in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used
to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages
of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements
regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product. 

 Sales
of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.
Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained
prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter
than that required for FDA approval. 

 The
Center for Veterinary Medicine CVM at the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates animal
pharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be
safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture. The new animal drug approval process is complicated. Before a new
animal drug may receive FDA approval, the sponsor must establish that the new animal drug is safe and effective. Drug sponsors must submit
a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) along with supporting data, including all adverse effects associated with the drug's use. The NADA
must also include information on the drug's chemistry; composition and component ingredients; manufacturing methods, facilities, and
controls; proposed labeling; analytical methods for residue detection and analysis if applicable; an environmental assessment; and other
information. The sponsor of a new animal drug is responsible for submitting all appropriate data to establish effectiveness and safety.
If the drug product is intended for use in a food-producing animal, residues in food products must also be established as safe for human
consumption. FDA review of the NADA submitted by drug sponsors is extremely detailed and comprehensive. The CVM s basis for approving
a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. . We will be required to conduct post-approval monitoring of FDA
approved pharmaceutical products and to submit reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results to the CVM s
Surveillance and Compliance group. No assurance may be given any new animal drug product which the Company may develop will be approved
by the FDA to be marketed and sold. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and Europe also have requirements
for approval of veterinary drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining regulatory approval
for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any other country.

 Item
5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

 Prior
to March 2023 no public market existed for our securities. In March 2023 the common shares of the Company began trading over the Pink 
market operated by OTC Markets Group under the symbol SYBE. 

 The
Company s common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules
require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk
disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.
In addition, the penny stock rules require that the broker-dealer, not otherwise exempt from such rules, must make a special written
determination that the penny stock is suitable for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These
disclosure rules have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to
the penny stock rules. So long as the common stock of the Company is subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell
common stock of the Company. 

 The
stockholders equity section of the Company contains the following class of capital stock as of July 31, 2023: 

 Common
stock, 0.0001 par value; 100,000,000 shares authorized: 10,613,492 shares issued and outstanding. 

 With
respect to each matter submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation, each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to cast
that number of votes which is equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock owned by such holder times one (1). 

 On
any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall receive,
out of assets legally available for distribution to the Company s stockholders, a ratable share in the assets of the Company.

As
of June 30, 2023 we had Interest Accrued but Unpaid of 27,476 consisting completely of interest accrued but yet to be paid on Notes
Payable and as of June 30, 2022 we had Interest Accrued but Unpaid of 13,253 consisting completely of interest accrued but yet to be
paid on Notes Payable. 

The increase in Interest Accrued but Unpaid of approximately 107 is attributable to 10,352 of interest accrued but not paid on 140,000
in Notes payable during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 as well as 3,870 interest accrued but not paid on 177,500 in Notes payable
during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. 

 As
of June 30, 2023 we recognized Unearned Income of 150,002 and as of June 30, 2022 we recognized Unearned Income of 161,699. Unearned
income recognized by the Company is completely attributable to 177, 450 in licensing fees paid to the Company during the quarter ended
June 30, 2021 which are being recognized over the term of the license. The decrease in Unearned Income is attributable to recognition
of these fees as earned as required pursuant to Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). 

 The
Company recognized revenue of 11,696 during the tear ended June 30, 2023 and revenue of 11,700 for the same period ended 2022. In both
periods revenue was attributable to 177, 450 in licensing fees paid to the Company during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 which
are being recognized over the term of the license. 

 Operating
Loss of 149,180 recognized during the year ended June 30, 2023 was approximately 164 higher than the Operating Loss recognized during
the same period ended 2022 which was 56,373. The increase in Operating Loss is primarily attributable to substantially higher Research
and Development and Consulting expenses incurred during the period ended 2023 as compared to the same period ended 2022. 

 Net
Loss for the year ended June 30, 2023 was 180,304 which is approximately 26 lower than the Net Loss recognized by the Company during
the same period ended 2022. This decrease is primarily attributable to the recognition of 175,721 of Unrealized Loss on Investment Securities
during the period ended 2022 . 

 As
of June 30, 2023 we had 3,786 in cash on hand and current liabilities of 241,411 such liabilities consisting of Income Tax Payable,
Notes Payable, and Accrued Expenses. We feel we will not be able to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and shall
be required to seek additional financing. 
 
Management plans to raise additional funds by obtaining governmental and nongovernmental grants as well as offering securities for cash.
Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company will use or how much capital the Company will raise. There is no guarantee
that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any type of offerings. Management can give no assurance that any governmental
or nongovernmental grant will be obtained by the Company despite the Company s best efforts. 

 As
of June 30, 2023 the Company was not party to any binding agreements which would commit SYBLEU to any material capital expenditures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

 To the shareholders and the board of directors
of SYBLEU INC. 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of SYBLEU INC. as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for
the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. 

 Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience
negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

 Critical Audit Matter 

 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. 

 We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 As
of June 30, 2023 

shares of common stock
were issued as employee compensation. 

 In determining Fair Value for shares issued
to employees an asset based valuation method was utilized , specifically Enterprise Value (Assets Less Cash and Cash Equivalents
plus Fair Value of Debt) less Fair Value of Debt. The following inputs were utilized. 

Fair Value of Intellectual Property 

Securities 

Notes Payable 

Accrued Interest 

Taxes Payable 

Less Total Debt 

() 
 
 Portion of Enterprise Value available to shareholders 

Fair Value per share 

Stock
issued for Non-Employee Services 

 Stock
Based compensation to non-employees is accounted for in accordance with ASC 505-50. ASC 505-50 requires entities to account for non-employee
equity transactions based on either the fair value of the services received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued utilizing
whichever measurement is most reliable 

 During
the year ended June 30, 2023 stock
was issued for Non-Employee Services . 

 Pursuant
to ASC 505-50-30-11505-50-30-11 an issuer shall measure the fair value of the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock
price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of the following dates, referred to as the measurement date: 

i. The
 date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments
 is reached (a performance commitment); and 

ii. The
 date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. 

uncertain
tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future. 

 The
Company generated a deferred tax credit through net operating loss carry forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100 has been
established. 

 Interest
and penalties on tax deficiencies recognized in accordance with ACS accounting standards are classified as income taxes in accordance
with ASC Topic 740-10-50-19. 

In
June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee
Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is intended to simplify aspects of share-based compensation issued to non-employees
by making the guidance consistent with the accounting for employee share-based compensation. This ASU is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. This guidance is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

 during
the period from June 12, 2020 (inception) through June 30, 2023. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to
obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Management
plans to raise additional funds by offering securities for cash. Management has yet to decide what type of offering the Company will
use or how much capital the Company will raise. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any
type of offerings.

Net
 deferred tax assets 

As
of June 30, 2023 the Company has a Deferred Tax Asset of completely
attributable to net operating loss carry forwards of approximately generated
during the calendar year ending December 31, 2020 and generated during the calendar year ended December
31, 2021 and generated during the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 (which expire 20 years from the date the loss was
incurred). 

 Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and
carry forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. The achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain. 

 In
addition, if as a result of a stock transfer or a reorganization, a corporation undergoes an ownership change, Code Section
382 limits the corporation s right to use its NOLs each year thereafter to an annual percentage of the fair market value of the
corporation at the time of the ownership change (the Section 382 Limitation ). 

 A
corporation is considered to undergo an ownership change if, as a result of changes in the stock ownership by 5-percent
shareholders or as a result of certain reorganizations, the percentage of the corporation s stock owned by those 5-percent
shareholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time
during the prior three-year testing period. Five-percent shareholders are persons who hold 5 or more of the stock of a corporation at
any time during the testing period as well as certain groups of shareholders (based typically on whether they acquired their shares in
a single offering or exchange transaction) who are not individually 5-percent shareholders. 

 As
the Company will require cash infusions in order to implement its business plan, and as it is probable, although not guaranteed, that
such funding needs may be met through the sale of equity securities to 5-percent shareholders , the Company recognized a
valuation allowance equal to the deferred Tax Asset and the Company recorded a valuation allowance reducing all deferred tax assets to
0. 

 Income
tax is calculated at the 
Federal Corporate Rate.

9A. Controls and Procedures 

 a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

 The
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as
of June 30, 2023. Based on this evaluation, they have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms
and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 b)
Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. 

 Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 13a-15(f) defines internal control over financial reporting
as follows: 

 The
term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that: 

 Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the issuer; 

 Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the issuer; and 

 Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

 The
Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s management
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. 

 The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 is based on
the framework in 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on its assessment, management
believes that, as of June 30, 2023 the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 

 Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management's report in this annual report. This exemption for smaller
reporting companies provided under the temporary rules referenced above has been made permanent under Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

33 

(c) There
have been no changes during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

 Code
of Ethics 

 On
July 20, 2020 we adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 

 Director
Independence 

 Audit
Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 

 The
members of the Company s board of Directors may not be considered independent. The Company is not a listed company 
under Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and is therefore not required to have an audit committee comprised
of independent directors. The Company does not currently have an audit committee, however, for certain purposes of the rules and regulations
of the SEC and in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company s Board of Directors is deemed to be its audit
committee and as such functions as an audit committee and performs some of the same functions as an audit committee including: (1) selection
and oversight of our independent accountant; (2) establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding
accounting, internal controls and auditing matters; and (3) engaging outside advisors. The Board of Directors has determined that its
member is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and has substantial business experience that results in that member's
financial sophistication. Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that its member has the sufficient knowledge and experience
necessary to fulfill the duties and obligations that an audit committee would have. 

35 

Nominating
and Compensation Committees 

 The
Company does not have standing nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. The board of directors
believes that it is not necessary to have a compensation committee at this time because the functions of such committee are adequately
performed by the board of directors. The board of directors also is of the view that it is appropriate for the Company not to have a
standing nominating committee because the board of directors has performed and will perform adequately the functions of a nominating
committee. The Company is not a listed company under SEC rules and is therefore not required to have a compensation committee
or a nominating committee. 

 Shareholder
Communications 

 There
has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors. There
are no specific, minimum qualifications that the board of directors believes must be met by a candidate recommended by the board of directors.
Currently, the entire board of directors decides on nominees, on the recommendation of any member of the board of directors followed
by the board s review of the candidates resumes and interview of candidates. Based on the information gathered, the board
of directors then makes a decision on whether to recommend the candidates as nominees for director. The Company does not pay any fee
to any third party or parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominee. 

 Because
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors has
determined not to adopt a formal methodology for communications from shareholders on the belief that any communication would be brought
to the Board of Directors attention by virtue of the co-extensive capacities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
