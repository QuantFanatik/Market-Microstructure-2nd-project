PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We are a leading provider
of integrated wireless solutions utilizing the latest in 5G (fifth generation) and 4G LTE (fourth generation long-term evolution) technologies
including mobile hotspots, routers, fixed wireless routers, and various trackers. Our integrated software subscription services provide
users remote capabilities including mobile device management (MDM) and software defined wide area networking (SD-WAN). 

We have majority ownership
of Franklin Technology Inc. (FTI), a research and development company based in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development
services for our wireless products. 

Our products are generally
marketed and sold directly to wireless operators and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base
primarily extends from North America and the Caribbean and South America to Asia. 

OUR STRUCTURE 

We incorporated in 1982 in
California and reincorporated in Nevada on January 2, 2008. The reincorporation had no effect on the nature of our business or our management.
Our headquarters office is located in San Diego, California. The office is principally composed of marketing, sales, operations, finance
and administrative support. It is responsible for all customer-related activities, such as marketing communications, product planning,
product management and customer support, along with sales and business development activities on a worldwide basis. 

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Franklin Technology Inc. FTI ), with a majority voting
interest of 66.3 (33.7 is owned by non-controlling interests) as of June 30, 2023, and 2022. In the preparation of consolidated financial
statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings (loss) are reduced by the portion of
the net earnings (loss) of the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests. 

Accounting Standards Codification ASC 280, Segment Reporting, requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about
their reportable operating segments. We identify our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker internally evaluates
separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility. We have one reportable segment, consisting
of the sale of wireless access products. We generate revenues from three geographic areas, consisting of North America, the Caribbean
and South America, and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS. 

The following risk factors
do not purport to be a complete explanation of the risks involved in our business. 

WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING
FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Our financial resources are sufficient for our current operational needs, however, the amount of funding required
to develop and commercialize our products and technologies is highly uncertain. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or on
terms satisfactory to us. Lack of funds may cause us to delay, reduce and/or abandon certain or all aspects of our development and commercialization
programs. We may seek additional financing through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities. In such event, the percentage
ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, and such securities may have rights,
preferences, and privileges senior to those of our Common Stock. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available
on terms favorable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to
fund our expansion, take advantage of desirable acquisition opportunities, develop, or enhance services or products or respond to competitive
pressures. Such inability could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. 

WE MAY INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. The industry in which we operate has many participants that own, or claim to own, proprietary intellectual
property. In the past we have received, and in the future may receive, claims from third parties alleging that we, and possibly our customers,
violate their intellectual property rights. Rights to intellectual property can be difficult to verify and litigation may be necessary
to establish whether or not we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In many cases, these third parties are companies
with substantially greater resources than us, and they may be able to, and may choose to, pursue complex litigation to a greater degree
than we could. Regardless of whether these infringement claims have merit or not, we may be subject to the following: 

We may be liable for potentially substantial damages, liabilities, and litigation costs, including attorneys fees; 

We may be prohibited from further use of the intellectual property and may be required to cease selling our products that are subject to the claim; 

We may have to license the third-party intellectual property, incurring royalty fees that may or may not be on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate and obtain such a license from the third party; 

We may have to develop a non-infringing alternative, which could be costly and delay or result in the loss of sales. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to develop such a non-infringing alternative; 

The diversion of management s attention and resources; 

Our relationships with customers may be adversely affected; and, 

We may be required to indemnify our customers for certain costs and damages they incur in such a claim. 

In the event of an unfavorable
outcome in such a claim and our inability to either obtain a license from the third party or develop a non-infringing alternative, then
our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected and we may have to restructure our business. 

4 

Absent a specific claim for
infringement of intellectual property, from time to time we have and expect to continue to license technology, intellectual property,
and software from third parties. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our third-party licenses or obtain new licenses
when required and this inability could materially adversely affect our business and operating results and the quality and functionality
of our products. In addition, there is no assurance that third party licenses we execute will be on commercially reasonable terms. 

Under purchase orders and
contracts for the sale of our products we may provide indemnification to our customers for potential intellectual property infringement
claims for which we may have no corresponding recourse against our third-party licensors. This potential liability, if realized, could
materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

WE OPERATE IN AN INTENSIVELY
COMPETITIVE MARKET. The wireless broadband data access market is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively. Many
of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. To survive
and be competitive, we will need to continuously invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. Increased
competition could result in price reductions, and smaller customer orders. Our failure to compete effectively could seriously impair our
business. 

WE OPERATE IN THE HIGH-RISK
TELECOM SECTOR. We are in a volatile industry. In addition, our revenue model is evolving and relies substantially on the assumption that
we will be able to successfully complete the development and sales of our products and services in the marketplace. Our prospects must
be considered in the light of the risk, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages
of development and marketing new products. To be successful in the market we must, among other things: 

Complete development and introduction of functional and attractive products and services; 

Attract and maintain customer loyalty; 

Establish and increase awareness of our brand and develop customer loyalty; 

Provide desirable products and services to customers at attractive prices; 

Establish and maintain strategic relationships with strategic partners and affiliates; 

Rapidly respond to competitive and technological developments; 

Build operations and customer service infrastructure to support our business; and 

Attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. 

We cannot guarantee that we
will be able to achieve these goals, and our failure to achieve them could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. We expect that revenues and operating results will fluctuate in the future. There is no assurance that any or all our efforts
will produce a successful outcome. 

5 

WE OPERATE IN THE HIGH-RISK
HARDWARE DESIGN INDUSTRY. We are in a volatile industry. In this industry it should be expected that: 

Latent design flaws can be discovered, even after a device has been certified; 

Latent component defects can be discovered in critical systems, including batteries, LCDs, chargers, and other systems; 

Manufacturing defects and flaws will occur during device production. 

WE OPERATE IN THE HIGH-RISK
SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. This industry has numerous and significant known risks. In this industry it should be expected that: 

Latent design flaws and security defects will be discovered, even after a device has been tested and approved; 

Code within a program will fail to operate as intended due to updates or changes in other systems; 

Hacking and malicious actions by outside parties can damage or alter coding and system integrity. 

POTENTIAL DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING
DEFECTS COULD OCCUR. Our product and service offerings may have quality issues from time to time, due to defects in software design, hardware
design or component manufacturing. As a result, our products and services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.
Component defects could make our products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. There can
be no assurance we will be able to detect and address all issues and defects in the hardware, software, and services we offer. Failure
to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our products and services. In addition, we may be exposed
to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or
intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. 

WE OPERATE IN A FIELD WITH
RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. We cannot be certain that our products and services will function as anticipated or be desirable to our intended
markets. Our current or future products and services may fail to function properly, and if our products and services do not achieve and
sustain market acceptance, our business, results of operations and profitability may suffer. If we are unable to predict and comply with
evolving wireless standards, our ability to introduce and sell new products will be adversely affected. If we fail to develop and introduce
products on time, we may lose customers and potential product orders. 

WE DEPEND ON THE DEMAND FOR
WIRELESS NETWORK CAPACITY. The demand for our products is completely dependent on the demand for broadband wireless access to networks.
If wireless operators do not deliver acceptable wireless service, our product sales may dramatically decline. Thus, if wireless operators
experience financial or network difficulties, it will likely reduce demand for our products. These are beyond our ability to control and
can either increase or decrease demand for our products. 

PANDEMIC OUTBREAKS CAN CAUSE
VOLATILE CHANGES IN THE MARKET. Demand for wireless access can rise and fall greatly during times of pandemic outbreaks, such as COVID-19,
as more people may be required to work remotely, and schools may be required to operate remote classrooms. When an outbreak ends, or becomes
more controlled, demand for wireless devices could decline rapidly, decreasing demand for our products. Pandemic outbreaks can also disrupt
supply chains, manufacturing operations, and shipping. These disruptions can make product fulfilment difficult, delayed, or impossible.
All these changes are beyond our ability to control and can cause revenue and income to change dramatically. 

6 

WE DEPEND ON COLLABORATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS. The development and commercialization of our products and services depend in large part upon our ability to selectively
enter and maintain collaborative arrangements with developers, distributors, service providers, network systems providers, core wireless
communications technology providers and manufacturers, among others. 

THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR MATERIAL
CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, AND THEREFORE SHAREHOLDER VALUE. We depend on a small number of customers
for a significant portion of our revenues. For the year ended June 30, 2023, net revenues from our two largest customers represented 61 
and 31 of our consolidated net sales, respectively. We have a written agreement with each of these customers that governs the
sale of products to them, but the agreements do not obligate them to purchase any quantity of products from us. If these customers were
to reduce their business with us, our revenues and profitability could materially decline. 

OUR PRODUCT DELIVERIES ARE
SUBJECT TO LONG LEAD TIMES. We often experience long-lead times to ship products, often more than 45 days. This could cause us to lose
customers, who may be able to secure faster delivery times from our competitors and require us to maintain higher levels of working capital. 

OUR PRODUCT-TO-MARKET CHALLENGE
IS CRITICAL. Our success depends on our ability to quickly enter the market and establish an early mover advantage. We must implement
an aggressive sales and marketing campaign to solicit customers and strategic partners. Any delay could seriously affect our ability to
establish and exploit effectively an early-to-market strategy. 

AS OUR BUSINESS EXPANDS INTERNATIONALLY,
WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RISKS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. Our expansion into international operations exposes us to
additional risks unique to such international markets, including the following: 

Increased credit management risks and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; 

Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, wireless communications standards, exchange rates, trading policies, tariffs, and other barriers; 

Uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the protection of intellectual property; 

Language barriers; and 

Potential adverse tax consequences. 

Furthermore, if we are unable to further develop
distribution channels in countries in North America, the Caribbean and South America, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), and Asia,
we may not be able to grow our international operations, and our ability to increase our revenue will be negatively impacted. 

We believe that our products
are currently exempt from international tariffs. If this were to change at any point, a tariff of 10 -25 of the purchase price could
be imposed. If such tariffs are imposed, they could have a materially adverse effect on sales and operating results. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD
RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS AND INABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS. Our products are subject to certain mandatory regulatory approvals in the
United States and other regions in which we operate. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission regulates many aspects
of communications devices. Although we have obtained all the necessary Federal Communications Commission and other required approvals
for the products we currently sell, we may not obtain approvals for future products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory
requirements may change, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals from countries other than the United States in which we
may desire to sell products in the future.

square feet of office space in San Diego, California, at a monthly rent of 25,754, pursuant to a lease expiring in December 2023. In
addition to monthly rent, the lease includes payment for certain common area costs. Our facility is covered by an appropriate level of
insurance, and we believe it to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense related to this property was
 309,053 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Our Korea-based subsidiary,
FTI, leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space, at a monthly rent of approximately 8,000, and additional office space consisting
of approximately 2,682 square feet at a monthly rent of approximately 2,700, both located in Seoul, Korea. These leases expired on August
31, 2023, and were extended for an additional twelve months to August 31, 2024. In addition to monthly rent, the leases provide for periodic
cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate level
of insurance, and we believe them to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs. Rent expense related to these leases
was approximately 128,400 for each of the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

We lease one corporate housing
facility, located in Seoul, Korea, primarily for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that expired on September
4, 2023, and was extended for an additional twelve months to September 4, 2024. Rent expense related to this lease was 8,095 and 8,604
for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

We are a leading provider
of integrated wireless solutions utilizing the latest in 4G LTE (fourth generation long-term evolution) and 5G (fifth generation) technologies
including mobile hotspots, routers, CPEs (Customer Premise Equipment), and various trackers. Our integrated software subscription services
provide users remote capabilities including mobile device management (MDM) and software defined wide area networking (SD-WAN). 

We have majority ownership
of Franklin Technology Inc. (FTI), a research and development company based in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development
services for our wireless products. 

Our products are generally
marketed and sold directly to wireless operators and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base
primarily extends from North America, the Caribbean and South America to countries in the Asia. 

FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS 

We believe that our revenue
growth will be influenced largely by (1) the successful maintenance of our existing customers, (2) the rate of increase in demand for
wireless data products, (3) customer acceptance of our new products, (4) new customer relationships and contracts, (5) our ability to
meet customers demands, (6) our ability to maintain good relationships with our manufacturing partners and suppliers, and (7) the
defect rates experienced by end users of our hardware and software products. 

We have entered into and expect
to continue to enter into new customer relationships and contracts for the supply of our products, and this may require significant demands
on our resources, resulting in increased operating, selling, and marketing expenses associated with such new customers. 

We continuously evaluate the
performance of our hardware and software products to discover defects that can adversely affect our revenue, income, and the price of
our stock. If defects occur that customers believe are either severe in nature or excessively frequent in occurrence, customers could
stop buying our products and services and the value of our stock may decrease. 

We are also seeing that demand
from end-users has been shifting in the post-pandemic economy as remote education and work from home trends are declining. Current demand
for mobile device management (MDM) services has been declining. We are working to improve and further enhance our software service offerings
to address this change in the market. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Revenue Recognition 

Contracts with Customers 

Revenue from sales of products
and services is derived from contracts with customers. The products and services covered by contracts primarily consist of hot spot routers.
Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service.
Payment terms are stated in the contract, primarily in the form of a purchase order. Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate
and price in the purchase order that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of our contracts do not contain variable
consideration. We establish a provision for estimated warranty and returns. Using historical averages, that provisions for the years ended
June 30, 2023, and 2022, were not material. 

10 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

In accordance with Topic 606,
we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and by the timing of when goods and services are transferred.
We determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories meets the disclosure objective in Topic 606, which is to depict how the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by regional economic factors. 

Contract Balances 

We perform our obligations
under a contract with a customer by transferring products in exchange for consideration from the customer. We typically invoice our customers
as soon as control of an asset is transferred, and a receivable is established. We, however, recognize contract liability when a customer
prepays for goods and/or services, or we have not delivered goods under the contract since we have not yet transferred control of the
goods and/or services. 

The balances of our trade
receivables are as follows: 

June 30, 2023 
 June 30, 2022 
 
 Accounts Receivable, net 
 8,949,802 
 1,322,619 

The balance of contract assets
was immaterial as we did not have a significant amount of un-invoiced receivables in the periods ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. 

Included
in the Accounts Receivable balance as of June 30, 2022, is a passthrough amount of 837,000. These transactions were a direct result of
an agreement between our vendor and our customer. There is a corresponding balance of 837,000 in our Accounts Payable account as of June
30, 2022, to offset. These balances are removed as of June 30, 2023, since these pass-through charges are unlikely to ever be collected
due to the customer's refusal to pay. There were no such balances as of June 30, 2023. 

Our contract liabilities,
which are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, are as follows: 

June 30, 2023 
 June 30, 2022 
 
 Undelivered products 
 146,488 
 371,624 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation is
a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good and/or service to the customer and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract
inception, we assess the products and/or services promised in our contracts with customers. We then identify performance obligations to
transfer distinct products and/or services to the customer. To identify performance obligations, we consider all the products or services
promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 

Our performance obligations
are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for over 99 of net
sales for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Revenue for non-recurring engineering projects is based on the percentage completion
of a project and accounted for under 1 of net sales for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Most of our revenue that is recognized
at a point in time is for the sale of hot-spot router products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer can direct
the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product, which generally coincides with title transfer at completion
of the shipping process. 

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022,
our contracts do not contain any unsatisfied performance obligations, except for undelivered products. 

11 

Capitalized Product Development
Costs 

Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other includes software that is part of a product or process to
be sold to a customer and shall be accounted for under Subtopic 985-20. Our products contain embedded software internally developed by
FTI, which is an integral part of these products because it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other
and the products are clearly unable to function without this coding. 

The costs of product development
that are capitalized once technological feasibility is determined (noted as Technology in progress in the Intangible Assets table, in
Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) include certifications, licenses, payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related
expenses associated with product development. We determine that technological feasibility for our products is reached after all high-risk
development issues have been resolved. Once the products are available for general release to our customers, we cease capitalizing the
product development costs and any additional costs, if any, are expensed. The capitalized product development costs are amortized on a
product-by-product basis using the straight-line amortization. The amortization begins when the products are available for general release
to our customers. 

As of June 30, 2023, and June
30, 2022, capitalized product development costs in progress were 203,838 and 187,343, respectively, and these amounts are included in
intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred 1,631,376 and 658,544,
respectively in capitalized product development costs, and all costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are expensed
and included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 

Income Taxes 

Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. As of June 30, 2023, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 2.5 million and 0.5
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 3.3 million and
 40,000, respectively. 

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the Act ), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the federal net operating loss of approximately 2.5 million,
which was recognized on or after January 1, 2018, will carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss of approximately 0.5
million will begin to expire through 2043. The utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions. 

Under the provision of ASC
740 Application of the Uncertain Tax Position Provisions related to accounting for uncertain tax positions, which prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest
amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Tax benefits of an uncertain tax position
will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained based on technical merits.

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 

NET SALES - Net sales
increased by 21,950,754, or 91.5 , to 45,948,516 for the year ended June 30, 2023 from 23,997,762 for the corresponding period of 2022. 
For the year ended June 30, 2023, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia
were 45,782,084 (99.6 of net sales), 0 (0.0 of net sales), and 166,432 (0.4 of net sales), respectively. For the year ended June
30, 2022, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were 23,305,366 (97.1 
of net sales), 2,375 (0.0 of net sales), and 690,021 (2.9 of net sales), respectively. 

Net sales in North America
increased by 22,476,718, or 96.4 , to 45,782,084 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 23,305,366 for the corresponding period of
2022. The increase in net sales in North America was primarily due to the new demand for two newly launched wireless products from a major
carrier customer (approximately 14M newly generated revenue) which did not purchase our products during the fiscal year 2022, and the
increased demand by approximately 11M, or 66 , for our wireless products from the existing major carrier customer compared to the fiscal
year 2022, which were offset by the decreased demands from other customers. 

Net sales in the Caribbean
and South America decreased by 2,375, or 100 , to 0 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 2,375 for the corresponding period of 2022.
Net sales in Asia decreased by 523,589, or 75.9 , to 166,432 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 690,021 for the corresponding period
of 2022. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the one-time revenue generated from the material sales by FTI for the fiscal year
2022, which was partially offset by the revenue generated from the demand for one newly launched wireless product by FTI (approximately
 160,000) for the year ended June 30, 2023. 

GROSS PROFIT - Gross
profit increased by 3,204,159, or 84.0 , to 7,020,742 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 3,816,583 for the corresponding period
of 2022. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 15.3 for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to 15.9 for the corresponding
period of 2022. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease in gross profit
in terms of net sales percentage was the mixed results of competitive selling prices and the increase in production costs of the launched
products. 

13 

OPERATING EXPENSES 
- Operating expenses increased by 578,842, or 6.6 , to 9,370,317 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 8,791,475 for the corresponding
period of 2022. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses increased by 942,309 to 5,451,653 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 4,509,344 for the corresponding period of 2022. The
increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increased payroll expenses (excluding payroll expense
for employees involved in research and development) and compensation expenses related to stock options granted for employees of approximately
 230,000 and 165,000, respectively, and the increased legal expenses of 195,000. 

Research and development expenses
decreased by 363,467 to 3,918,664 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 4,282,131 for the corresponding period of 2022. The decrease
in research and development expense was primarily due to the mix of the timing of research and development activities and the number of
active projects, which typically vary from period to period. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the research and development expenses decreased
by approximately 450,000, which is partially offset by the increased payroll expenses for employees involved in research and development
of approximately 89,000. 

OTHER INCOME, NET -
Other income, net decreased by 1,747,162, or 658.3 , to 1,481,743 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 265,419 for the corresponding
period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the loss from the agreement in principle to settle a legal action of 2,400,000 and
the increased loss from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FTI of approximately 184,000, which were offset by
the increased interest income earned from the money market accounts and certificates of deposit of approximately 388,000, the increased
unrealized gain from an investment account of approximately 340,000, and the increased gain from forgiven liabilities of approximately
 199,000. 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022, COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 

NET SALES - Net sales
decreased by 160,117,583, or 87.0 , to 23,997,762 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 184,115,345 for the corresponding period of
2021. For the year ended June 30, 2022, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America,
and Asia were 23,305,366 (97.1 of net sales), 2,375 (0.0 of net sales), and 690,021 (2.9 of net sales), respectively. For the year
ended June 30, 2021, net sales by geographic regions, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia were 183,771,146
(99.8 of net sales), 17,500 (0.0 of net sales), and 326,699 (0.2 of net sales), respectively. 

Net sales in North America
decreased by 160,465,780, or 87.3 , to 23,305,366 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 183,771,146 for the corresponding period of
2021. The decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to the reduction of demand for wireless products from one major carrier
customer, resulting from the unprecedented high volume of demand for wireless products during the prior period, which coincided with the
early stages of the Covid-19 Pandemic period. Net sales in the Caribbean and South America decreased by 15,125, or 86.4 , to 2,375 for
the year ended June 30, 2022, from 17,500 for the corresponding period of 2021. Net sales in Asia increased by 363,322, or 111.2 , to
 690,021 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 326,699 for the corresponding period of 2021. The increase in net sales was primarily
due to the revenue generated from the material sales by FTI, which typically vary from period to period. 

GROSS PROFIT - Gross
profit decreased by 28,647,438, or 88.2 , to 3,816,583 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 32,464,021 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The gross profit in terms of net sales percentage was 15.9 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to 17.6 for the corresponding
period of 2021. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the change in net sales as described above. The decrease in gross profit
in terms of net sales percentage was primarily due to variations in customer and product mix, competitive selling prices and product costs
which generally vary from period to period and region to region. 

14 

OPERATING EXPENSES 
- Operating expenses decreased by 854,236, or 8.9 , to 8,791,475 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 9,645,711 for the corresponding
period of 2021. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses decreased by 568,504 to 4,509,344 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 5,077,848 for the corresponding period of 2021. The
decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased shipping and handling charges of approximately
 480,000, decreased payroll expense as well as bad debt expense of approximately 340,000, which are partially offset by the increased
compensation expense related to stock options granted for employees and amortization expense of approximately 165,000 and 141,000, respectively. 

Research and development expenses
decreased by 363,467 to 3,918,664 for the year ended June 30, 2023, from 4,282,131 for the corresponding period of 2022.
The decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to the mix of the timing of research and development activities and
the number of active projects, which typically vary from period to period. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the research and development
expenses decreased by approximately 450,000, which is partially offset by the increased payroll expenses for employees involved in research
and development of approximately 89,000. 

OTHER INCOME, NET -
Other income, net decreased by 351,748, or 57.0 , to 265,419 for the year ended June 30, 2022, from 617,167 for the corresponding period
of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the forgiveness of the Payroll Protection Plan loan during the fiscal year 2021, with no similar
transaction in fiscal year 2022, as well as decreased product development funding received by FTI from a government entity. This was partially
offset by the gain from the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates in FTI and the increased interest income earned from
the money market accounts and certificates of deposit. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our historical operating results,
capital resources and financial position, in combination with current projections and estimates, were considered in management's plan
and intentions to fund our operations over a reasonable period of time, which we define as the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2023.
For the purposes of liquidity disclosures, we assess the likelihood that we have sufficient available working capital and other principal
sources of liquidity to fund our operating activities and obligations as they become due. 

Our principal source of liquidity
as of June 30, 2023, consisted of cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term investments of 38,969,599. We believe we have
sufficient available capital to cover our existing operations and obligations through at least June 30, 2024. Our long-term future
cash requirements will depend on numerous factors, including our revenue base, profit margins, product development activities, market
acceptance of our products, future expansion plans and ability to control costs. If we are unable to achieve our current business
plan or secure additional funding that may be required, we would need to curtail our operations or take other similar actions outside
the ordinary course of business in order to continue to operate as a going concern. 

OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were 1,882,114 and 7,407,355, respectively. 

The 1,882,114 in net cash
used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable of 7,601,489 as
well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges), which was offset by the
increase of accounts payable and accrued legal contingency expense of 4,905,499 and 2,400,000, respectively. The 7,407,355 in net cash
used in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in accounts
payable of 3,222,344 and 1,537,287, respectively, as well as our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization,
and other non-cash charges), which was offset by the decrease of accounts receivable of 1,205,938. 

15 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 was 12,109,183 and 11,675,028, respectively. 

The 12,109,183 in net cash
used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the purchases of short-term investments of 10,391,654
and capitalized product development of 1,631,376. The 11,675,028 in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30,

FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

For the next twelve months,
we may require in excess of 5 million for capital expenditures, software licenses and for testing and certifying new products. 

We believe we will be able
to fund our future cash requirements for operations from our cash available, operating cash flows, bank lines of credit and issuance of
equity securities. We believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures. However,
we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund
the expansion of our sales and to satisfy the related working capital requirements for the next twelve months. Our ability to satisfy
such obligations also depends upon our future performance, which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks,
and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, including factors beyond our control. See Item 1A, Risk
Factors included in this report. 

If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments, we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital.
Additionally, we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego expansion opportunities. We might not be able
to effect these alternative strategies to raise funds including credit lines and loans, on satisfactory terms, if at all.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our management has evaluated,
under the supervision and with the participation of OC Kim, our President, and Bill Bauer, our Acting Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our President and the Acting Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that, as of June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal accounting officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There have been no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act or in other
factors that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. 

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

To evaluate the effectiveness
of internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management conducted an assessment,
using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, (specifically the 2013 framework) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management concluded that we maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023.

 ______________________ 

(1) On 7/14/2023, the board of directors appointed Mr. Lee as Senior Vice President of Sales who previously served as Chief Operating
Officer. This change did not affect his compensation. 

OC Kim has been our
President, CEO and a Director since 2003. Prior to joining Franklin Wireless, Mr. Kim was the CEO and President of Accetio Inc., a
company he founded that developed modules for the wireless telecommunication industry. In 2003, Accetio Inc. merged with
Franklin Telecommunications Corp. and was renamed Franklin Wireless Corp. He was a general manager of Kolon California Corp., one of
Korea's most prominent conglomerates. While at Kolon Data Communications, in Korea, Mr. Kim helped introduce the first generation of
CDMA phones to the Korean market through his work with Qualcomm Personal Electronics (QPE), a joint venture between Qualcomm
Incorporated and Sony Electronics Inc. Mr. Kim began his career at Lucky Goldstar (LG) Electronics. He has almost 30 years of
experience in sales, marketing, and operations management in the telecommunications and information systems industries. He earned a
B.A. from Sogang University in Korea. We believe Mr. Kim s qualifications to serve as a director of the Company include his
extensive business, operational and management experience in the wireless industry, including his current position as the
Company s President. In addition, his knowledge of the Company s business, products, strategic relationships and future
opportunities is of great value to the Company. 

Gary Nelson has been
a director since September 2003. Mr. Nelson was an early investor in Franklin Telecommunications Corp. in the 1980 s and served
as a director from 2001 up until the Company s merger with Accetio Inc. in September 2003, at which time the Company was renamed
Franklin Wireless Corp. Following the merger, Mr. Nelson became a director and ultimately Chairman of the Board of Franklin Wireless Corp.
He was co-founder and President of Churchill Mortgage Corporation, an income property mortgage banking firm based in Los Angeles, California,
which was a loan correspondent for major life insurance companies and other financial institutions. In addition, Mr. Nelson was the Chief
Operating Officer of Churchill Mortgage Capital, which was the loan origination arm of Churchill Mortgage Corporation. Mr. Nelson s
prior experience includes various marketing positions with Control Data Corporation and design engineering positions with North American
Aviation where he worked on the Apollo Project. He holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Kansas State University and an MBA from
the University of Southern California. We believe that Mr. Nelson s qualifications to serve as a director of the Company include
his many years of business, operational and management experience including his previous position as President of Churchill Mortgage Corporation.
In addition, Mr. Nelson has served as a director of the Company for 14 years, and brings a valuable historical perspective on the development
of the Company s business and its leadership. 

Johnathan Chee has been
a director since September 2009. He is an attorney and has owned the Law Offices of Johnathan Chee, in Niles, Illinois, since August
2007. Mr. Chee has represented clients in various business dealings and negotiations with Ameritech, SBC, Sprint and several wireless
carriers in Latin America. Between 1998 and 2007, he served as an attorney with the C S Law Group, P.C., in Glenview, Illinois. He
holds a B.A. from the University of Illinois-Chicago and a J.D. from IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. He is a member of the Illinois Bar
Association. We believe Mr. Chee s qualifications to serve as a director of the Company include his experience as a business attorney
that allow him to provide the Company s Board of Directors with valuable knowledge of legal matters that may affect the Company.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 

On October 1, 2020, we entered
into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim, our President, and Yun J. (David) Lee, our Chief Operating Officer. Each Change of Control
Agreement provides for a lump sum payment to the officer in case of a change of control of the Company. The term includes the acquisition
of Common Stock of the Company resulting in one person or company owning more than 50 of the outstanding shares, a significant change
in the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company during any 12-month period, a reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar
transaction resulting in the transfer of ownership of more than fifty percent (50 of the Company's outstanding Common Stock, or a liquidation
or dissolution of the Company or sale of substantially all of the Company's assets. These agreements were for an initial term of three
years but have now been extended through October 2024. 

The Change of Control Agreement
with Mr. Kim calls for a payment of 5 million upon a change of control, and the agreement with Mr. Lee calls for a payment of 2 million
upon a change of control. 

On November 10, 2022, the
Company and OC Kim, its President, entered into an amendment of the employment letter agreement dated September 7, 2021. The amendment
provides for a severance payment of 3 million if Mr. Kim voluntarily terminates his employment by the Company or if he voluntarily terminates
his employment due to a change in circumstances, generally defined as a material breach by the Company of its salary and
benefit obligations or a significant reduction in Mr. Kim s title or responsibilities. In the case of a termination of employment
by the Company for cause (generally defined as conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment is imposed, commission of any
act of theft, fraud, dishonesty, or material falsification of any employment or Company records, or improper disclosure of the Company's
confidential or proprietary information), the Company is to make a severance payment of 1,500,000. In either case, any unvested options
become immediately vested. 

22 

In the amendment, Mr. Kim
also agrees that, for a period of two years after termination, he will not disparage the Company or its officers, solicit any of its employees
to terminate their employment, or disclose any of the Company s proprietary information. 

In addition, the amendment
provides for the payment of an incentive bonus to Mr. Kim of 125,000 for each calendar quarter during the remaining four-year term of
the employment letter, with the first such bonus due on December 31, 2022. 

The Change in Control Agreement
with Mr. Kim, dated October 1, 2020, has not been terminated and remains in effect at this time. 

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

GENERAL PHILOSOPHY -
We compensate our executive officers through a mix of base salary, incentive compensation and stock options. Our compensation policies
are designed to be competitive with comparable employers and to align management s incentives with both near-term and long-term
interests of our stockholders. We use informal methods of benchmarking our executive compensation, based on the experience of our directors
or, in some cases, studies of industry standards. Our compensation is negotiated on a case by case basis, with attention being given to
the amount of compensation necessary to make a competitive offer and the relative compensation among our executive officers. 

BASE SALARIES 
We want to provide our senior management with a level of cash compensation in the form of base salary that facilitates an appropriate
lifestyle given their professional status and accomplishments. 

INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
 Our practice is to award cash bonuses based upon performance objectives set by the Board of Directors. We maintain a bonus plan
which provides our executive officers to earn cash bonuses based on the achievement of performance targets. The performance targets are
set by the Board of Directors, and our executive officers are eligible to receive bonuses on a quarterly basis. The actual amount of incentive
compensation paid to our executive officers is in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. 

SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
 We are generally an at-will employer and have no employment agreements with severance benefits; however, we have
entered into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim David Lee, and a severance agreement with OC Kim that provides him with
a lump sum payment in the event he leaves the Company. 

RETIREMENT PLANS 
In January 2022, we implemented the CalSavers retirement program, an automatic enrollment individual retirement account (IRA). The program
is a voluntary participation program, and all employees have the option to participate in this program if they choose to do so.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Franklin Wireless Corp. 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Franklin Wireless Corp. and its subsidiary (the Company as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and 2022 and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the entity s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is
a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in
any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate . 

F- 2 

Description of the Matter 

Legal Proceedings 
 
 As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial
 statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the
 loss and when loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management records as an accrual in its
 consolidated financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate.
 Management either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that
 such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount
 of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

The principal considerations for our determination
 that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing
 the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim, which in turn led to significant
 auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assessment of the liabilities and
 disclosures associated with legal proceedings. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures
 and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures
 included determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as evaluating disclosures
 citing the compliance with the financial reporting framework. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the
 letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding
 whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company s
 disclosures related to legal proceedings and accounting in the consolidated financial statements. 

We have served as the Company s auditors
since 2020.

the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of
the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests. 

As consolidated financial
statements are based on the assumption that they represent the financial position and operating results of a single economic entity, the
retained earnings or deficit of the subsidiary at the date of acquisition, October 1, 2009, by the parent are excluded from consolidated
retained earnings. When a subsidiary is consolidated, the consolidated financial statements include the subsidiary s revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses only from the date the subsidiary is initially consolidated, and the non-controlling interest is reported in the consolidated
statement of financial position within equity, separately from the parent s equity. There are no shares of the Company held by any
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023, or June 30, 2022.

The balance of contract assets
was immaterial as we did not have a significant amount of un-invoiced receivables in the periods ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022. 

Included
in the Accounts Receivable balance as of June 30, 2022, is a passthrough amount of 837,000. These transactions were a direct result of
an agreement between our vendor and our customer. There is a corresponding balance of 837,000 in our Accounts Payable account as of June
30, 2022, to offset. These balances are removed as of June 30, 2023, since these pass-through charges are unlikely to ever be collected
due to the customer's refusal to pay. There were no such balances as of June 30, 2023. 

Our contract liabilities,
which are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, are as follows: 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation is
a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good and/or service to the customer and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606. At contract
inception, we assess the products and/or services promised in our contracts with customers. We then identify performance obligations to
transfer distinct products and/or services to the customer. To identify performance obligations, we consider all the products or services
promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. 

Our performance obligations
are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue from products transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for over 99 of net
sales for the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. Revenue for non-recurring engineering projects is based on the percentage completion
of a project and accounted for under 1 of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. Most of our revenue that is recognized
at a point in time is for the sale of hot-spot router products. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when the customer can direct
the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the product, which generally coincides with title transfer at completion
of the shipping process. 

As of June 30, 2023, and 2022,
our contracts do not contain any unsatisfied performance obligations, except for undelivered products. 

and associated with capitalized product development
costs associated with complete technology for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 

and , respectively, and these amounts are included in
intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred in capitalized product
development costs, and all costs incurred before technological feasibility is reached are expensed and included in our consolidated statements
of comprehensive income (loss).

2023. For the year ended June 30, 2022, net sales to our two largest customers represented and of our consolidated net sales,
respectively, and of our accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2022. No other customer accounted for more than ten percent of
total net sales. 

For the year ended June 30,
2023, we purchased the majority of our wireless data products from three manufacturing companies located in Asia. If they were to experience
delays, capacity constraints or quality control problems, product shipments to our customers could be delayed, or our customers could
consequently elect to cancel the underlying product purchase order, which would negatively impact our revenue. For the year ended June
30, 2023, we purchased wireless data products from these suppliers in the amount of , or of total purchases, and had
related accounts payable of as of June 30, 2023. For the year ended June 30, 2022, we purchased wireless data products from
our two suppliers in the amount of , or of total purchases, and had related accounts payable of as of June
30, 2022. 

We maintain our cash accounts
with established commercial banks. Such cash deposits exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of 250,000 for each
financial institution. However, we do not anticipate any losses on excess deposits. 

The carrying values of the
Company s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable and debt, are calculated based on their approximate their fair values due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment.
We invest our excess cash into financial instruments which management believes are readily convertible into cash, such as money market
funds and certificates of deposit.

The benefit for income taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect
the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets are as follows:

Less valuation allowance 

Net deferred tax asset 

Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. We have evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of our gross deferred tax assets, including the amount
and timing of forecasted future taxable income. Management determined it is more likely than not that the federal deferred tax assets
will be fully realized, and no valuation allowance is necessary as of June 30, 2023, or 2022. 

As of June 30, 2023, we have
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million , respectively. Under the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the federal net operating loss of approximately million , which was recognized
on or after January 1, 2018, will carry forward indefinitely. There is federal net operating loss, which was recognized on or before
December 31, 2017. The state net operating loss of approximately million will begin to expire through 2043. The utilization of net
operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state
provisions. 

We apply the provisions of
ASC 740 related to accounting for uncertain tax positions, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording
in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under this provision, the impact of
an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Tax benefits of an uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less
than a 50 likelihood of being sustained based on technical merits. 

A reconciliation of the beginning
and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits, which have been considered in the Company's computation of its deferred tax assets, is
as follows: 

Gross increase 

Balance as of June 30, 2022 

Gross increase 

Balance as of June 30, 2023 

We do not anticipate any material
change in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to occur within the next twelve months. ASC 740 requires us to accrue interest
and penalties where there is an underpayment of taxes based on our best estimate of the amount ultimately to be paid. Our policy is to
recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. We have not recorded any interest
or penalties as the liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits is immaterial. We are subject to taxation in the U.S., and
various state and foreign jurisdictions. 

For the years ended June 30,
2023, and 2022, we were in a net loss position and have excluded and stock options from the calculation of diluted net
loss per share because these securities are anti-dilutive.

We determine whether an arrangement
contains a lease at inception. A lease is a contract that provides the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. Operating leases are recorded in the balance sheet as right-of-use asset ROU asset and operating lease
obligation. ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent
our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement
date of the lease and measure based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term. The ROU asset also includes deferred rent
liabilities. Our lease arrangement generally does not provide an implicit interest rate. As a result, in such situations, we use its incremental
borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We include
options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option in the measurement of its ROU
assets and liabilities. Lease expense for operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We are also electing
not to apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases of twelve months or less and instead will recognize lease payments as expense
on a straight-line basis over the lease term . 

On September 9, 2015, we signed
a lease for new office space consisting of approximately 12,775 square feet, located in San Diego, California, which commenced on October
28, 2015. In addition to monthly rent, the new lease includes payment for certain common area costs. The term of the lease for the new
office space was four years from the lease commencement date and was then extended at a monthly rent of 25,754, by an additional fifty
months to December 31, 2023. Our facility is covered by an appropriate level of insurance, and we believe it to be suitable for our use
and adequate for our present needs. 

Our Korea-based subsidiary,
FTI, leases approximately 10,000 square feet of office space, at a monthly rent of approximately 8,000, and additional office space consisting
of approximately 2,682 square feet at a monthly rent of approximately 2,700, both located in Seoul, Korea. These leases expired on August
31, 2023, and were extended by an additional twelve months to August 31, 2024. In addition to monthly rent, the leases provide for periodic
cost of living increases in the base rent and payment for certain common area costs. These facilities are covered by an appropriate level
of insurance, and we believe them to be suitable for our use and adequate for our present needs. We lease one corporate housing facility,
located in Seoul, Korea, primarily for our employees who travel, under a non-cancelable operating lease that expired on September 4, 2023,
and were extended by an additional twelve months to September 4, 2024. Short-term leases with initial terms of twelve months or less are
not capitalized, and our leases of the South Korean offices and corporate housing facility have been considered as short-term lease. 

The components of lease expense
and supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 are as follows: 

As of June 30, 2023, we used
discount rates of in determining
our operating lease liabilities for the office spaces in San Diego, California. This rate represented our incremental borrowing rates
at that time. Short-term leases with initial terms of twelve months or less are not capitalized, and our lease of the South Korean offices
has been considered as short-term lease. Our San Diego office lease was extension of previous lease and did not contain any further extension
provisions. Rent expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 were

Verizon Jetpack Recall

On April 8, 2021, Verizon
issued a press release announcing that it was working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to conduct a voluntary recall
of certain Verizon Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspot devices, indicating that the lithium-ion battery in the devices can overheat, posing
a fire and burn hazard. According to the CPSC release, the recall affects approximately 2.5 million devices. We import the devices and
supply them to Verizon. 

Verizon first advised us of
one alleged Jetpack device failure at the end of February 2021. We immediately began meeting with Verizon and requested access to the
device. We also began internal testing to evaluate device performance. We did not receive any further incident information until the last
week of March 2021. On April 1, 2021 we issued a press release announcing that we had received reports from Verizon about potential issues
with the batteries in the devices. On April 9, 2021 we issued a press release announcing the voluntary recall by Verizon. 

As of the date of this report,
we have been unable to recreate any device failures of the type identified by Verizon. All internal testing conducted to date has confirmed
that the Jetpack devices are performing within normal parameters. We are not currently aware of any aspect of the Jetpack design that
could cause the devices to fail in the way described in Verizon s recall notice. 

Future Impact on Financial
Performance 

We are striving to avoid any
litigation with Verizon arising from the recall and have not been served with any legal action by Verizon relating to the products covered
by the recall. We are not currently able to estimate the financial impact of the recall on our future operations. At this time, we do
not have information that identifies the cause of the alleged incidents. We also do not have any specific legal claims or theories of
causation for device failure incidents that would help us estimate the cost of potential future litigation. No liability has been recorded
for this litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. 

Franklin v. Anydata, Inc . 

We entered into a Professional
Services Agreement with Anydata Corp. Anydata for the product ACT233F Smart Link OBD device on May 5, 2017, for a minimum
purchase commitment of 250,000 units. We delivered approximately 25,000 units and 7,000 units during our second and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2018, respectively, and an additional 18,000 units during our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Sales to Anydata were approximately
 1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. We received information that Anydata may not be able to fulfill the entire purchase commitment
for which parts have already been ordered with our main vendor, Quanta. We believe that the Company will be able to supply some of the
products to another customer and we received personal guarantees from the ownership group of Anydata. As of June 30, 2019, the remaining
unfulfilled purchase commitment was approximately 3.1 million. The total product purchase commitment with Quanta was approximately 2.9
million. We have not recorded a receivable from Anydata, nor a liability owed to Quanta. Management believes that, at this time, a loss
contingency is reasonably possible but not estimable as to how much ultimately would be paid to Quanta. As of June 30, 2020, we paid 
for the right to call on inventory and recorded an additional as a prepaid expense related to pricing adjustments, which has been
agreed with Quanta for other products to ensure demand is met, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the prepaid expense of 
has been recorded as a cost of goods sold. As of June 30, 2023, there is a reasonable possibility we may incur a loss; however, the amount
is not estimable at this time. On January 25, 2021, we commenced legal action against Anydata and its principal officers in San Diego
Superior Court, case number 37-2021-00003468-CU-BC-CTL. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, a confidential settlement has been reached
between the parties for an immaterial amount and as of the date of this report, the action is expected to be dismissed within the next
30 days. 

Shareholder Litigation 

Ali 

A shareholder action,
Ali vs. Franklin Wireless Corp. et al. Case #3:21-cv-00687-AJB-MSB, was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of
California (San Diego) on April 16, 2021, alleging, among other things, that we had prior knowledge that the Verizon recall was
likely and that we did not disclose that information to investors in a timely manner. The Class and Defendants have executed a
Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement under which the Class releases all claims against Defendants in exchange for a payment by
Defendants of 
million (the Settlement Amount ), which is reflected in liabilities under accrued legal contingency
expense with a corresponding charge to loss from a legal contingency . The Class has submitted a motion for
preliminary approval of the settlement, which the Court has not yet ruled on. If and when the Court grants preliminary approval of
the Settlement, Defendants will be required to deposit the Settlement Amount into an escrow account established to administer the

against these claims. No liability has been recorded for this litigation because the Company believes that any such liability is not probable
and reasonably estimable at this time. 

Change of Control Agreements 

On October 1, 2020, we entered
into Change of Control Agreements with OC Kim, our President, and Yun J. (David) Lee, our Chief Operating Officer. Each Change of Control
Agreement provides for a lump sum payment to the officer in case we experience a change of control. The term includes the acquisition
of our Common Stock resulting in one person or company owning more than 50 of the outstanding shares, a significant change in the composition
of the Board of Directors during any 12-month period, a reorganization, merger, consolidation or similar transaction resulting in the
transfer of ownership of more than fifty percent (50 of our outstanding Common Stock, or a liquidation or dissolution or sale of substantially
all of our assets. 

The Change of Control
Agreement with Mr. Kim calls for a payment of 5 million upon a change of control, and the agreement with Mr. Lee calls for a
payment of 2 million upon a change of control. The Change in Control Agreements, dated October 1, 2020, have been extended through
September 30, 2024. 

Severance Agreement 

On
November 10, 2022 the Company and OC Kim, its President, entered into an amendment of the employment letter agreement dated September
7, 2021. The amendment provides for a severance payment of 3 million if Mr. Kim voluntarily terminates his employment by the Company
or if he voluntarily terminates his employment due to a change in circumstances, generally defined as a material breach
by the Company of its salary and benefit obligations or a significant reduction in Mr. Kim s title or responsibilities. In the case
of a termination of employment by the Company for cause (generally defined as conviction of a felony, or a misdemeanor where imprisonment
is imposed, commission of any act of theft, fraud, dishonesty, or material falsification of any employment or Company records, or improper
disclosure of the Company's confidential or proprietary information), the Company is to make a severance payment of 1,500,000. In either
case, any unvested options become immediately vested. 

In
the amendment, Mr. Kim also agrees that, for a period of two years after termination, he will not disparage the Company or its officers,
solicit any of its employees to terminate their employment, or disclose any of the Company s proprietary information. 

In
addition, the amendment provides for the payment of an incentive bonus to Mr. Kim of 125,000 for each calendar quarter during the remaining
four year term of the employment letter, with the first such bonus due on December 31, 2022. 

Loan Agreement with Subsidiary 

On March 21, 2022, Franklin Wireless Corp. (the
 Company entered into a Loan Agreement with Franklin Technology Incorporation, a Republic of Korea corporation FTI ),
under which the Company agreed to loan US to FTI. The Company owns a majority of the outstanding equity of FTI. FTI s
primary business is providing design and development services to the Company for our wireless products. As part of the loan transaction,
FTI delivered a 10 million Promissory Note to the Company (the Note ). 

The purpose of the loan is to allow FTI to purchase
a facility in South Korea to house its operations, and to provide it with additional working capital. The purchase of such a facility
with the loan proceeds is subject to the Company s reasonable approval. Upon acquisition of the facility, FTI is required to grant
the Company a mortgage on it to secure payment of the Note. 

The Note is for a term of five years, provides
for annual payments of interest at 2 per annum, and is due and payable upon maturity. The Note and Loan Agreement include customary provisions
for default and acceleration upon default, and a default interest rate of 7 per annum. 

International Tariffs 

We believe that our products
are currently exempt from international tariffs upon import from our manufacturers to the United States. If this were to change at any
point, a tariff of 10 -25 of the purchase price would be imposed. If such tariffs are imposed, they could have a materially adverse effect
on sales and operating results. 

Customer Indemnification 

Under purchase orders and
contracts for the sale of our products we may provide indemnification to our customers for potential intellectual property infringement
claims for which we may have no corresponding recourse against our third-party licensors. This potential liability, if realized, could
materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

shares of Common Stock. The Plan provide for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted
stock to our employees, directors, and independent contractors. These options will have such vesting or other provisions as may be established
by the Board of Directors at the time of each grant. 

The estimated forfeiture rate
considers historical turnover rates stratified into employee pools in comparison with an overall employee turnover rate, as well as expectations
about the future. We periodically revise the estimated forfeiture rate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
There were and compensation expenses recorded under this method for the years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 

A summary of the status of
our stock options is presented below:
